            "abstract": "Recent global and regional studies of seismic tomography in both oceans and continents show linear bands of low velocity anomalies that are aligned with absolute plate motion and coincident with intraplate volcanic chains. To explain the seismic and gravity anomalies observed beneath the Pacific ocean small scale convection is frequently cited but this model does explain the wide range of wavelengths that are reported. We propose a new hypothesis suggesting that viscous fingering instabilities can form when hot and wet mantle plumes discharge into the upper mantle and displace higher viscosity depleted asthenosphere. Fingers travel laterally through the asthenospheric channel below moving plates and are correlated with melting and intraplate volcanic chains observed on the seafloor. The development of viscous fingering instabilities are investigated in laboratory fluid experiments using high viscosity miscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell scaled to the Earth using appropriate non-dimensional parameters. We perform a set of fluid experiments with viscosity ratios 3 to 200. Viscous fingers are observed to form for all viscosity ratios above 3.0 Pa s. After an initial growth period, fingers exhibit a constant wavelength for a given viscosity ratio. Fingering wavelength is strongly dependent on the plate spacing and therefore asthenospheric layer thickness. The average fingering wavelength is shown to increase with increasing viscosity ratio. When the viscosity ratio is high we observe longer fingers that initiate closer to the point of origin. Plate motion will be simulated using a sheet of mylar moving over radial fingers. Preliminary results indicate that fingers align with plate motion both upstream and downstream. This new model for viscous fingering may link off-axis mantle plumes to spreading centers where they contribute to melting, surface volcanism and the growth and formation of new lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Climate change, extreme climate events, and climate-induced disturbances will have a substantial and detrimental impact on terrestrial ecosystems. How ecosystems respond to these impacts will, in turn, have a significant effect on the quantity, quality, and timing of water supply for energy security, agriculture, industry, and municipal use. As a community, we lack sufficient quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the complex interplay between climate extremes (e.g., drought, floods), ecosystem dynamics (e.g., vegetation succession), and disruptive events (e.g., wildfire) to assess ecosystem vulnerabilities and to design mitigation strategies that minimize or prevent catastrophic ecosystem impacts.\nThrough a combination of experimental and observational science and modeling, we are developing a unique multi-physics ecohydrologic framework for understanding and quantifying feedbacks between novel climate and extremes, surface and subsurface hydrology, ecosystem dynamics, and disruptive events in critical watersheds. The simulation capability integrates and advances coupled surface-subsurface hydrology from the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), dynamic vegetation succession from the Ecosystem Demography (ED) model, and QUICFIRE, a novel wildfire behavior model developed from the FIRETEC platform. These advances are expected to make extensive contributions to the literature and to earth system modeling.\nThe framework is designed to predict, quantify, and mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable watersheds, with a focus on the US Mountain West and the energy-water nexus. This emerging capability is used to identify tipping points in watershed ecosystems, quantify impacts on downstream users, and formally evaluate mitigation efforts including forest (e.g., thinning, prescribed burns) and watershed (e.g., slope stabilization). The framework is being trained, validated, and demonstrated using field observations and remote data collections in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, including pre- and post-wildfire and infestation observations. Ultimately, the framework will be applied to the upper Colorado River basin. Here, we present an overview of the framework development strategy and latest field and modeling results.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how barrier islands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States respond to storms and sea-level rise is an important management concern. Although these threats are well recognized, quantifying the integrated vulnerability is challenging due to the range of time and space scalesover which these processes act. Developing datasets and methods to identify the physical vulnerabilities of coastal environments due to storms and sea-level rise thus is an important scientific focus that supports land management decision making. Here we employ a Bayesian Network (BN) to model the interactions between geomorphic variables sampled from existing datasets that capture both storm-and sea-level rise related coastal evolution. The BN provides a means of estimating probabilities of changes in specific geomorphic characteristics such as foredune crest height, beach width, beach height, given knowledge of barrier island width, maximum barrier island elevation, distance from an inlet, the presence of anthropogenic modifications, and long-term shoreline change rates, which we assume to be directly related to sea-level rise. We evaluate BN skill and explore how different constraints, such as shoreline change characteristics (eroding, stable, accreting), distance to nearby inlets and island width, affect the probability distributions of future morphological characteristics. Our work demonstrates that a skillful BN can be constructed and that factors such as distance to inlet, shoreline change rate, and the presence of human alterations have the strongest influences on network performance. For Assateague Island, Maryland/Virginia, USA, we find that different shoreline change behaviors affect the probabilities of specific geomorphic characteristics, such as dune height, which allows us to identify vulnerable locations on the barrier island where habitat or infrastructure may be vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "Oyster reefs have been shown to provide myriad critical ecosystem services, however their role in directing flow and currents during non-storm conditions has been largely neglected. In many regions, oyster reefs form as linear structures perpendicular to the coast and across the path of streams and rivers, potentially entraining large volumes of freshwater flow and altering nearshore mixing. We hypothesize that these reefs have the potential to influence salinity over large areas, providing a “keystone” ecosystem service by supporting multiple estuarine functions. Here we present results from a field and modeling study to quantify the effects of reef extent and elevation on estuarine salinities under varying river discharge. We found salinity differences ranging from 2 to 16 g/kg between inshore and offshore sides of degraded oyster reefs in the Suwannee Sound (FL, USA), supporting the role of reefs as local-scale freshwater dams. Moreover, differences between inshore and offshore salinities were correlated with flow, with the most marked differences during periods of low flow. Hydrodynamic modeling using the 3-D Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) suggests that the currently degraded reef system entrained greater volumes of freshwater in the past, buffering the landward advance of high salinities, particularly during low flow events related to droughts. Using ROMS, we also modeled a variety of hypothetical oyster bar morphology scenarios (historical, current, and “restored”) to understand how changes in reef structure (elevation, extent, and completeness) impact estuarine mixing and near-shore salinities. Taken together, these results serve to: 1) elucidate a poorly documented ecosystem service of oyster reefs; 2) provide an estimate of the magnitude and sptial extent of the freshwater entrainment effect; and 3) offer quantitative information to managers and restoration specialists interested in restoring oyster habitat.",

            "abstract": "Though aerosol radiative effects have been recognized as some of the largest sources of uncertainty among the forcers of climate change, the verification of the spatial and temporal variability of the magnitude and directionality of aerosol radiative forcing has remained challenging. Significant and contrasting changes in tropospheric aerosol burden have occurred over the past two decades as a result of changing patterns of emissions of primary aerosol and gaseous precursors. During this period, SO2 and NOx emissions across the US have reduced by about 66% & 50%, respectively. In contrast, anthropogenic emissions have increased dramatically across Asia. These changes provide an opportunity for conducting a systematic investigation of the processes regulating aerosol distributions, their optical properties, and verification of their simulated radiative effects for past conditions relative to measurements. We conduct multi-decadal simulations for the 1990-2010 period with the two-way coupled WRF-CMAQ modeling system over a domain covering the northern hemisphere and a nested finer resolution continental U.S. domain. Simulated aerosol size and composition and size are used to estimate their optical properties which are then used in the radiation calculations impacting both photolysis rates and atmospheric dynamics. Model results (aerosol burden and composition, radiation, temperature) over North America and Asia are analyzed in conjunction surface, aloft and remote sensing measurements to contrast the differing trends in aerosol-radiation interactions in these regions over the past two decades. Both model and measurements indicate significant reductions in tropospheric aerosol burden across North America and an associated increase in shortwave radiation at the surface. In contrast, an increase in tropospheric aerosol burden and reduction in surface shortwave radiation in noted across large portions of Asia during the past two decades. Simulated trends in aerosol composition, tropospheric burden, and radiative effects are compared with those inferred from available measurements. Model simulations with and without aerosol radiative effects are analyzed to assess the impacts of these interactions on severity of air pollution episodes.",

            "abstract": "Global flood risk is increasing in response to population growth in flood-prone areas, human encroachment into natural flood paths (exacerbating flooding in areas formerly out of harm’s way), and climate change (which alters variables driving floods). How will societies respond to and manage flood risk in coming decades? Analysis of flood policy evolution in the EU and US demonstrates that changes occurred in steps, in direct response to disasters. After the flood produced by the collapse of Tous Dam in 1982, Spain initiated a systematic assessment of areas of greatest flood risk and civil protection response. The devastating floods on the Elbe and elsewhere in central Europe in 2002 motivated adoption of the EU Floods Directive (2007), which requires member states to develop systematic flood risk maps (now due) and flood risk management plans (due in 2015). The flooding of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 resulted in a nationwide levee-safety assessment and improvements in communicating risk, but overall less fundamental change in US flood management than manifest in the EU since 2007. In the developing world, large (and increasing) concentrations of populations in low-lying floodplains, deltas, and coasts are increasingly vulnerable, and governments mostly ill-equipped to implement fundamental changes in land use to prevent future increases in exposure, nor to develop responses to the current threats. Even in the developed world, there is surprisingly little research on how well residents of flood-prone lands understand their true risk, especially when they are ‘protected’ by ‘100-year’ levees. Looking ahead, researchers and decision makers should prioritize improvements in flood risk perception, river-basin-scale assessment of flood runoff processes (under current and future climate and land-use conditions) and flood management alternatives, and bridging the disconnect between national and international floodplain management policies and local land-use decisions.",

The cruise program focused on seafloor sampling and acoustic investigations of gas seeps, flares, mud volcanoes, slumps and debris flows, canyons and channels in the coastal proximity.\nA comprehensive multidisciplinary program to train students has been developed to cover sedimentology, fluid geochemistry, biology, geophysics and marine geology in general. Daily lectures were conducted on board by academics presenting pertinent research projects, and cruise planning and preliminary results were discussed with all the scientific crew.\nA daily blog with updates on the expedition activities, images, and ongoing cruise results, was also completed (i.e. visit the cruise blog: http://baikal.festivalnauki.ru/) and gave the opportunity to interact with experts as well as attract the interest also of a broader audience.\nThis project is a follow up to the well-established UNESCO Training-through-Research (TTR) Floating University Programme (http://floatinguniversity.ru/) that covered large areas on the European and arctic margins since 1991 with 18 research cruises attended by about 1000 BSc, MSc and PhD students from Europe, Asia, Africa and America. The crucial goal of both programmes is the training of new generations of scientists through active research directly on the field. Students can access the collected data and samples for their Master and PhD projects. Typically an extensive set of analyses and data processing is completed in-house and the results and interpretations are presented at post cruise meetings and international conferences.\nThe Baikal lake is 25 million years old rift zone and provides a large variety of active geological features that can be easily reached at daily sailing distance. This represents an extraordinary opportunity to switch and focus on different disciplines and processes. We envisage extending the duration of the following expeditions completing several crew changes in order to broaden the international cooperation.",

            "abstract": "Large water infrastructure projects have fueled the economies of developed countries and led to the widespread degradation of freshwater ecosystems. Proposed dams promise to similarly transform the economies and environment of developing countries. Yet with rapidly changing climate, traditional water infrastructure design carries with it an increased risk of failure if climate conditions shift beyond design parameters. Environmental concerns have long been at the periphery of water management decision-making. However, the destabilizing effect of climate change on traditional engineering practices, coupled with increased societal interest in sustainable water management, now present an opportunity to better integrate ecological principles in water infrastructure planning and design. Here we operationalize sustainable water management by incorporating ecological performance metrics with traditional engineering performance criteria in a decision-analysis framework. We adapt the decision-scaling risk assessment approach to evaluate ecological consequences of water management decisions and quantify tradeoffs and synergies among economic and environmental objectives. We apply the framework to the Iowa River system, where recent changes in flood intensity have prompted managers to consider alternative flood control strategies, including new infrastructure and reservoir operation rules. The system was modeled to quantify flood damages (to Iowa City and agricultural lands) and the ecological benefits of river floodplain inundation under alternative management and climate scenarios. We found that raising levees substantially reduced economic damages under wetter and more variable climate futures, but provided limited ecological benefits relative to the status quo. In contrast, changes in reservoir operations did not reduce the risk of catastrophic flood damage, but provided significant ecological benefits associated with increased floodplain inundation. The management option that provided the greatest ecological and economic benefits over the widest range of future climates involved raising existing levees and allowing for controlled floodplain inundation.",

Here we document failure of the BHFS to transition from a catalytic oxidation sensor used to measure low NG (~5% or less) concentrations to a thermal conductivity sensor for higher concentrations (from ~5% to 100%), resulting in underestimation of NG emission rates, under one or more conditions: 1), calibration is more than ~2 weeks old; 2), firmware is out of date; or 3), the NG source is less than ~91% CH4.

            "abstract": "Lava flow morphology is often utilized as an indicator of rheological behavior during flow emplacement. Rheological behavior can be characterized by the viscosity and yield strength of lava, which in turn are dependent on physical and chemical properties including crystallinity, vesicularity, and bulk composition. We are studying the rheology of a basaltic lava flow from a monogenetic Holocene cinder cone in the Cima lava field (Mojave Desert, California). The flow is roughly 2.5 km long and up to 700m wide, with a well-developed central channel along much of its length. Samples were collected along seven different traverses across the flow, along with real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS profiles to allow levee heights and slopes to be measured. Surface textures change from pahoehoe ropes near the vent to predominantly jagged `a`a blocks over the majority of the flow, including all levees and the toe. Chemically the lava shows little variation, plotting on the trachybasalt-basanite boundary on the total alkali-silica diagram. Mineralogically the lava is dominated by plagioclase, clinopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts, with abundant flow-aligned plagioclase microcrystals. The total crystal fraction is ~50% near the vent, with higher percentages in the distal portion of the flow. Vesicularity varies between ~10 and more than ~60%. Levees are ~10-15m high with slopes typically ~25-35˚, suggesting a yield strength at final emplacement of ~150,000 Pa. The effective emplacement temperature and yield strength of lava samples will be determined using the parallel-plate technique. We will test the hypothesis that these physical and rheological properties of the lava during final emplacement correlate with spatial patterns in flow morphology, such as average slope and levee width, which have been determined using remote sensing observations (Beem et al. 2014).",

            "abstract": "Measurements of the forest-atmosphere exchange of carbon isotopes can be used to partition the net total carbon exchange (measured by standard eddy covariance) into its photosynthetic and respiratory components. This partitioning requires an estimate of the isotopic signature of canopy-scale photosynthesis, which has been obtained to date by assuming that the canopy behaves like a single ‘big leaf’. This assumption neglects the heterogeneity of the canopy both vertically and with respect to leaf angles: leaves at various heights and angles experience different sunlight, temperature, and wind, and are physiologically different as well. In order to explore errors associated with the big leaf assumption, we applied a big leaf isotopic partitioning algorithm to canopy-scale net fluxes of 13CO2, 12CO2, heat, and water generated by a multi-leaf isotopic canopy simulation. The simulation included micro-environmental heterogeneity produced by the canopy geometry (leaf angles and arrangement) as well as physiological variation among leaves, invoking leaf-level energy balance to determine leaf temperatures. Leaf behavior in the simulation was parameterized by leaf-level gas-exchange measurements of the relevant characteristics of a range of leaves in the canopy (e.g. limiting photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, daytime respiration). These measurements indicated that photosynthetic capacity increased with height in the canopy, but that within a given canopy layer, leaf behavior showed surprisingly little variability. They also indicated that stomatal conductance did not relate quasi-linearly to light or photosynthetic rate, but was instead roughly constant with light at all photosynthetic photon flux densities above 100 μE m-2 s-1. The multi-leaf simulation incorporating these leaf behaviors suggested that the big leaf assumption is valid under diffuse light conditions but can lead to significant errors under clear sky conditions.",

            "abstract": "Communities in the southwestern U.S. rely on forested watersheds to provide high-quality water, but these watersheds are prone to major disturbance by wildfire. The loss of vegetation and litter can decrease water storage and infiltration and decrease nutrient uptake, leading to enhanced surface runoff, erosion, and nutrient export compared to undisturbed watersheds. Post-wildfire impacts on water quality vary widely across geographic regions, and are largely driven by post-fire storm timing and intensity. In the southwestern U.S., the North American Monsoon can produce high-intensity rain from July through September. A better understanding of the post-fire water-quality response of watersheds to monsoonal storms in this region is therefore critical. The Fourmile Canyon Fire burned 2600 ha near Boulder, Colorado in September 2010, including 23% of the Fourmile Creek watershed. This watershed had been recovering from historical mining activity, and dispersed waste rock and mine tailings were only partially revegetated before the wildfire. We collected water quality, hydrological, and meteorological data with high temporal and spatial density upstream and downstream of the burned area for 4 years post-fire. For 9 months post-fire, the area received snow or low-intensity rain, and the difference in stream water chemistry between burned and unburned watersheds was minimal. However, in the summer of 2011, and in the following two summers, relatively common monsoonal storms caused dramatic, but short-lived, increases in discharge, sediment, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and metals downstream of the burned area. Such pulses can degrade aquatic ecosystems, impair water treatability, and decrease reservoir capacity. Climate change is projected to increase wildfire frequency and size and lead to an earlier and longer wildfire season. Simultaneously, storm frequency and intensity are predicted to increase, and the monsoon season may occur later in the year, potentially decreasing the average length of time between wildfire and subsequent high-intensity rain events. This suggests that substantial water-quality impacts may be more common in the future, resulting in a new paradigm for water treatment in the southwestern U.S.",

We combine more than 100 survey-mode GPS velocities (Crowell et al., 2013) with Envisat InSAR observations from descending tracks 84 and 356 and ascending tracks 77 and 306 (149 total acquisitions), processed using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) package (Hooper et al., 2007). The result is a dense map of surface velocities across the Imperial fault and surrounding areas. The data suggest that a previously little-known extension of the Superstition Hills fault through the town of El Centro may accommodate a significant portion of the slip previously attributed to the Imperial Fault. We investigate a suite of possible models for the transfer of this slip to the Imperial and Cerro Prieto faults to the south, yielding a range of plausible hazard scenarios. Finally, we compare the geodetic data to models of earthquake cycles with rate- and state-dependent friction to assess the implications for creep depth, moment accumulation rate, and recurrence interval of large events on these faults.",

Estimates of the topside F-region ion density rely on accurately predicting the peak density and height of the F-layer and describing how the density decays with altitude. The latest incarnation of the IRI model (IRI-2012) includes two options to estimate the F-peak and three options to shape the topside profile. Previously it was shown that IRI overestimated the topside ionospheric densities during solar minimum between cycles 23 and 24, and the relative performance of the three topside shaper functions were compared. Here we reconstruct maps of the ionosphere near the magnetic equator using information about the F-peak from the Formosa Satellite-3/ Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) and ion densities above 400 km from the Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI) instrument on the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite. By simultaneously comparing the both the peak ionospheric density and the topside ion densities, we can better evaluate the combinations of the component models in IRI-2012.",

            "abstract": "Described here is a technique for H isotope analysis of organic compounds pyrolyzed from kerogens isolated from gas- and liquid-rich shales. Application of this technique will progress the understanding of the use of H isotopes not only in potential kerogen occurrences on Mars, but also in terrestrial oil and gas resource plays. H isotope extraction and analyses were carried out utilizing a CDS 5000 Pyroprobe connected to a Thermo Trace GC interfaced with a Thermo MAT 253 IRMS. Also, a split of GC-separated products was sent to a DSQ II quadrupole MS to make qualitative and semi-quantitative compositional measurements of these products.\nKerogen samples from five different basins (type II, II-S) were dehydrated (heated to 80°C overnight under vacuum) and analyzed for their H isotope compositions by Pyrolysis-GC-MS-TC-IRMS. This technique takes pyrolysis products separated via GC and reacts them in a high temperature conversion furnace, quantitatively forming H2. Samples ranging from ~0.5 to 1.0mg in size, were pyrolyzed at 800°C for 30s. and separated on a Poraplot Q GC column.\nH isotope data from all kerogen samples typically show enrichment in D from low to high molecular weight. H2O average δD = -215.2‰ (V-SMOW), ranging from -271.8‰ for the Marcellus Shale to -51.9‰ for a Polish shale. Higher molecular weight compounds like toluene (C7H8) have an average δD of -89.7‰, ranging from -156.0‰ for the Barnett Shale to -50.0‰ for the Monterey Shale. We interpret these data as representative of potential H isotope exchange between hydrocarbons and sediment pore water during basin formation. Since hydrocarbon H isotopes readily exchange with water, these data may provide some useful information on gas-water or oil-water interaction in resource plays, and further as a possible indicator of paleo-environmental conditions. Alternatively, our data may be an indication of H isotope exchange with water and/or acid during the kerogen isolation process. Either of these interpretations will prove useful when deciphering H isotope data derived from kerogen analyses. Understanding the role that these H-bearing compounds play in terrestrial shale paleo-environmental reconstruction may also prove useful as analogs for understanding the interactions of water and potential kerogen/organic compounds on the planet Mars.",

            "abstract": "There are many data types and methods of analysis in rock and paleomagnetic investigations. The MagIC database (http://earthref.org/MAGIC) was designed to accommodate the vast majority of data used in such investigations. Yet getting data from the laboratory into the database, and visualizing and re-analyzing data downloaded from the database, makes special demands on data formatting.\nThere are several recently published programming packages that deal with single types of data: demagnetization experiments (e.g., Lurcock et al., 2012), paleointensity experiments (e.g., Leonhardt et al., 2004), and FORC diagrams (e.g., Harrison et al., 2008). However, there is a need for a unified set of open source, cross-platform software that deals with the great variety of data types in a consistent way and facilitates importing data into the MagIC format, analyzing them and uploading them into the MagIC database. The PmagPy software package (http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/) comprises a such a comprehensive set of tools. It facilitates conversion of many laboratory formats into the common MagIC format and allows interpretation of demagnetization and Thellier-type experimental data. With some 175 programs and over 250 functions, it can be used to create a wide variety of plots and allows manipulation of downloaded data sets as well as preparation of new contributions for uploading to the MagIC database.",

            "abstract": "Sprites are spectacular transient luminous structures observed in the 50-95 km altitude range above active thunderstorms following large cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. Recordings at 10,000 images per second show impressive streamer activity with bright streamers moving up or down at velocities up to half the speed of light. Not surprisingly, the streamers have attracted much research attention. However, here we will concentrate on sprite beads, which together with sprite glows, are the dominant features in video images (30 or 25 images per second) and in photographs. Sprite glow forms after streamer activity near the sprite onset altitude and beads are small point-like optical features also associated with streamer activity. The reason that the glow and the beads are dominant in longer exposure images is primarily that they do not move much and hence light can integrate over the longer exposure times. In general, streamer activity at the start of the sprite lasts a few 10s of ms, while glow and beads last considerable longer; we have observed beads lasting in excess of 500 ms. High-speed imaging shows the glow and the beads to form along the path of streamers, but they do not appear optically before almost a millisecond after streamer passage. To first order, beads appear to be stationary, but a detailed analysis of high-speed observations often indicates a slow upward or downward motion. The optical emissions decay much slower than in other parts of the sprite indicating the presence of a longer lasting source of energy. The processes in beads leave an imprint, presumably creating a local irregularity, on the atmosphere lasting longer than the optical emissions. This imprint can serve as seed for streamer initiation in a subsequent sprite (re-ignition). Based on our observations the imprint can last up to 1 second. There have been suggestions that beads are formed around local pre-existing inhomogineities, but a recent observation indicate their formation more related to internal dynamics within the streamer channel. A sprite observation in August 2014 shows a streamer channel with beads spaced at regular intervals along the streamer path, which seems to be an unlikely distribution of pre-existing irregularities. A modeling effort based on these ideas is underway. ",

The K/Pg boundary layer with its global distribution provides a high resolution marker, allowing high precision stratigraphic analyses in marine and continental sequences. Following crater formation, sedimentation re-established in the carbonate platform, filling the basin. Crater is located half on-land and half offshore, with the crater floor covered by sediments with variable thickness up to about 1 km. The target, impact and post-impact sequences have been drilled and cored, providing samples for stratigraphic, petrographic and physical-chemical laboratory studies. The post-impact stratigraphy has been analyzed in several studies at proximal, intermediate and distal outcrops and in the crater boreholes, using e.g., radiometric dating, micropaleontology, paleomagnetism, and strontium and stable isotope geochemistry. Emphasis has been given on the impact breccias-carbonates contact and the basal Paleocene sequence. Here we re-analyze the available data, revisiting the stratigraphy for the Santa Elena, Tekax, Peto and Yaxcopoil-1 boreholes using newly constructed detailed lithostratigraphic columns in the continuously cored boreholes. Additionally we extend the study to the Paleogene sequence in the Santa Elena and Yaxcopoil-1 boreholes using bulk carbon and oxygen isotopes, magnetic polarity, XRF core geochemistry and magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy. Results spanning chrons c29 to c24 constrain the K/Pg boundary, c29r-c29n polarity reversal and the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, providing high resolution records. The basal Paleocene gap and age differences in an integrated stratigraphy are discussed and correlated to the GPTS scale and IODP marine isotope records. The extent and characteristics of crater structure and target/cover sediments have been imaged with terrestrial, marine and aerogeophysical surveys. We use the marine seismic sections for correlation of the geophysical logs and borehole stratigraphy, allowing lateral correlation across the crater and further constraining the sequence stratigraphy, platform evolution and impact effects.",

            "abstract": "GCM-based climate projections and downscaled climate data proliferate, and there are many climate-aware vegetation models in use by researchers. Yet application of fine-scale DGVM based simulation output in national forest vulnerability assessments is not common, because there are technical, administrative and social barriers for their use by managers and policy makers. As part of a science-management climate change adaptation partnership, we performed simulations of vegetation response to climate change for four national forests in the Blue Mountains of Oregon using the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) for use in vulnerability assessments. Our simulation results under business-as-usual scenarios suggest a starkly different future forest conditions for three out of the four national forests in the study area, making their adoption by forest managers a potential challenge. However, using DGVM output to structure discussion of potential vegetation changes provides a suitable framework to discuss the dynamic nature of vegetation change compared to using more commonly available model output (e.g. species distribution models). From the onset, we planned and coordinated our work with national forest managers to maximize the utility and the consideration of the simulation results in planning. Key lessons from this collaboration were: (1) structured and strategic selection of a small number climate change scenarios that capture the range of variability in future conditions simplified results; (2) collecting and integrating data from managers for use in simulations increased support and interest in applying output; (3) a structured, regionally focused, and hierarchical calibration of the DGVM produced well-validated results; (4) simple approaches to quantifying uncertainty in simulation results facilitated communication; and (5) interpretation of model results in a holistic context in relation to multiple lines of evidence produced balanced guidance. This latest point demonstrates the importance of using model out as a forum for discussion along with other information, rather than using model output in an inappropriately predictive sense. These lessons are being applied currently to other national forests in the Pacific Northwest to contribute in vulnerability assessments.",

Simplified studies using in-lab 'simulated' extreme environments, such as UV bulbs or cold blocks, are manually intensive, error-prone, and lose many complexities of the microbe/environment interaction.\nWe have built a prototype instrument to address this dilemma by allowing automated iterations of microbial cultures to be subject to combinations of modular environmental pressures such as heat, radiation, and chemical exposure. The presence of multiple sensors allows the state of the culture and internal environment to be continuously monitored and adjusted in response.\nOur first prototype showed successful iterations of microbial growth and thermal exposure. Our second prototype, presented here, performs an demonstration of repeated exposure of Escherichia coli to ultraviolet radiation, a well-established procedure. As the E. coli becomes more resistant to ultraviolet radiation, the device detects their increased survival and growth and increases the dosage accordingly. Calibration data for the instrument was generated by performing the same proof-of-concept exposure experiment, at a smaller scale, by hand.\nCurrent performance data indicates that our finalized instrument will have the ability to run hundreds of iterations with multiple selection pressures. The automated sensing and adaptive exposure that the device provides will inform the challenges of managing and culturing life tailored to uncommon environmental stresses.\nWe have designed this device to be flexible, extensible, low-cost and easy to reproduce. We hope that it enter wide use as a tool for conducting scalable studies of the interaction between extremophiles and multiple environmental stresses, and potentially for generating artificial extremophiles as analogues for life we might find in extreme environments here on Earth or elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "We present a comparison of three stochastic approaches for estimating log hydraulic conductivity (Y) and predicting steady-state groundwater flow. Two of the approaches are based on the data assimilation technique known as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and differ in the way prior statistical moment estimates (PSME) (required to build the Kalman gain matrix) are obtained. In the first approach, the Monte Carlo method is employed to compute PSME of the variables and parameters; we denote this approach by EnKFMC. In the second approach PSME are computed through the direct solution of approximate nonlocal (integrodifferential) equations that govern the spatial conditional ensemble means (statistical expectations) and covariances of hydraulic head (h) and fluxes; we denote this approach by EnKFME. The third approach consists of geostatistical stochastic inversion of the same nonlocal moment equations; we denote this approach by IME. In addition to testing the EnKFMC and EnKFME methods in the traditional manner that estimate Y over the entire grid, we propose novel corresponding algorithms that estimate Y at a few selected locations and then interpolate over all grid elements via kriging as done in the IME method. We tested these methods to estimate Y and h in steady-state groundwater flow in a synthetic two-dimensional domain with a well pumping at a constant rate, located at the center of the domain. In addition, to evaluate the performance of the estimation methods, we generated four unconditional different realizations that served as “true” fields. The results of our numerical experiments indicate that the three methods were effective in estimating h, reaching at least 80% of predictive coverage, although both EnKF were superior to the IME method. With respect to estimating Y, the three methods reached similar accuracy in terms of the mean absolute value error. Coupling the EnKF methods with kriging to estimate Y reduces to one fourth the CPU time required for data assimilation while both estimation accuracy and uncertainty do not deteriorate significantly.",

            "abstract": "To ensure permanence of carbon dioxide stored in a geologic formation it is essential to maintain wellbore integrity to prevent leakage of gas to the surface or surficial aquifers. Among others, the Mt. Simon Sandstone of the Illinois Basin has been targeted by DOE partnerships for supercritical CO2 injection. In this study, we used lab experiments to test the feasibility of microbially-mediated sealing of a leaking wellbore and then used the data to model the biofilm growth and calcite precipitation while accounting for over nine chemical reactions. Sporosarcina pasteurii was investigated for its ability to precipitate calcium carbonate to seal fractures in cement or within the Mt. Simon Sandstone formation, at variable pressure and temperature conditions. S. pasteurii cultures were studied in a rocking autoclave at temperature (ca. 40oC) and pressure (ca. 12 MPa) consistent with the geologic formation at depth and surficial changes were characterized before and after experimental incubations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). At temperatures up to 40oC, atmospheric pressure, and in the presence of the Mt. Simon brine (1.016 M NaCl, 0.171M CaCl2, 0.067 M MgCl2, 0.017 M Na2SO4, 0.006 M NaHCO3), S. pasteurii thrived and showed evidence of biofilm formation using SECM. These data are the first to be applied to the newly developed computational model that extends a singular and degenerate model of biofilm growth and incorporates a variational inequality to remove the singularity. This study extends our knowledge of the stability of biologically generated carbonate species, and the associated biota, in pore-space and fractures of pertinent geological strata and cement under conditions consistent with deep storage of CO2.",

            "abstract": "Celadonite is a low-temperature (<~50 °C) alteration mineral that fills voids and fractures within buried and metasomatized volcanic rocks. The common occurrence, mineral chemistry and structural properties of celadonite (a K2O-rich and Ar retentive phyllosilicate) make it attractive as a monitor of not only spatial and temporal variability of low-temperature hydrothermal fluid circulation and alteration, but also potentially of burial rates of lava piles.\nThe Neogene lava pile in E Iceland underwent burial metamorphism, tectonic tilting and subsequent glacial exhumation, and is today exposed with superimposed sub-horizontal regional zeolite facies mineral zones. From a single sample of the Skessa Tuff, a prominent welded pyroclastic flow, we present new 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating age determinations using the ARGUS-VI multi-collector mass spectrometer at OSU: plagioclase (10.26 ± 0.12 Ma), groundmass (10.15 ± 0.10 Ma), early-forming light green celadonite (9.73 ± 0.03 Ma) and later-forming dark blue-green celadonite (9.67 ± 0.03). The sample was collected at ~500 m above sea level (masl), beneath volcanic material from the Thingmuli dyke swarm and central volcano.\nThe cooling ages of plagioclase and groundmass separates are in close agreement and represent the eruption age of this pyroclastic flow. The geochronologic data and petrographic observations suggest homogeneous and relatively rapid crystallization of celadonite. The inferred original top of the lava pile is ~650 m (1400 masl, and lost to erosion) above the top of the analcime zone (~750 masl). Celadonite is predominantly found as early-stage lining of primary pore space, but overgrown by chlorite/smectite clays and zeolites at higher grades. Above ~750 mals vesicles are void of celadonite, and hence, celadonite precipitates in a narrow zone at ~650 m depth. The pyroclastic flow and its subsequent burial to ~650 m depth is separated by ~600 ky, which suggests a burial rate of ~1100 m/m.y. This burial rate is 2x that of estimates from contemporaneous sections located away from central volcanoes. Considering the proximity of the sampling site to Thingmuli, it seems reasonable to expect a greater burial rate. Thermochronology and celadonite 40Ar/39Ar dating can unravel tectono-magmatic processes associated with the burial of flood basalt piles.",

The torus varies both spatially and temporally, driven by changes in volcanism and asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere. We report results from 9 nights of observation spanning November 2013 to February 2014 with the Dual Imaging Spectrograph on the ARC 3.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. Emissions in these data include the [SII] doublets at 6716/6731A and 4069/4076A, [OII] at 3726/3729A, [SIII] at 3722A and 6312A, as well as resonantly scattered neutral [NaI] at 5890/5896A. Constraints on electron density, temperature and ion mixing rations can be obtained. Observations of both ansa during a 5 hour period characterize the complete longitudinal structure. Specifically, the intensity ratio of the collisionally excited [SII] doublet at 6716/6731A is a diagnostic for local electron density sampled at ~20 minute cadence. Absolute intensity can be derived directly from the reflectance of Jupiter's disc and standard calibrations are performed on the data such as bias subtraction, wavelength calibration and recti fication. A unique background subtraction procedure is developed to disentangle scattered Jovian reflection and the torus. These observations were made in conjunction with JAXA's Hisaki mission, the HST auroral campaign and infrared monitoring of volcanism to better understand how mass and energy are transported throughout the system.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the rates and drivers of subsidence in deltas is essential to manage subaerial land in these naturally ephemeral settings. Subsidence in deltaic settings may be driven by deep crustal processes including isostasy and faulting, compaction of Holocene deposits, and anthropogenic activities such as groundwater management and fluid withdrawal. Here, we offer a new method to measure compaction rates and their spatial variability in the Mississippi Delta (MD) to test the null hypotheses that compaction increases seaward and is a major driver of subsidence.\nLate Holocene compaction rates are measured using the mouthbar-overbank stratigraphic boundary. This boundary generally corresponds to mean low tide level; therefore its present-day height relative to coeval mean low tide level is a measure of compaction since the formation of this boundary. The age of this boundary is established through quartz OSL dating, and Holocene relative sea level history in the MD has been well-established. The common occurrence of the mouthbar-overbank boundary in progradational fluviodeltaic successions in the MD makes it possible to study the spatial variability of compaction rates. We also compare displacement rates for this boundary directly north and south of two coast-parallel normal faults.\nResults show that late Holocene compaction rates in the Lafourche subdelta of the MD are on the order of a few mm/yr, significantly lower than historical surface subsidence rates for the region. Therefore, the elevated historical surface subsidence rates are likely the result of human alteration of the delta such as fluid withdrawal and groundwater management. Compaction rates do not increase seaward as generally assumed, and instead seem to be driven primarily by the thickness of sediments overlying the mouthbar sands. Thus, the highest rates are documented relatively inland. In addition, we do not find a significant increase in subsidence across normal faults in our study area, suggesting that the contribution of faulting to subsidence has been minimal over the past millennium.",

            "abstract": "In January 2013, a Mw 7.5 earthquake ruptured a segment of the Queen Charlotte Fault offshore the town of Craig in southeast Alaska. The region of the fault that slipped during the Craig earthquake is adjacent to and possibly overlapping with the northern extent of the 1949 M 8.1 Queen Charlotte earthquake rupture (Canada’s largest recorded earthquake), and is just south of the rupture area of the 1972 M 7.6 earthquake near Sitka, Alaska. Here we present aftershock locations and focal mechanisms for events that occurred four months following the mainshock using data recorded on an Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) array that was deployed offshore of Prince of Wales Island. This array consisted of 9 short period instruments surrounding the fault segment, and recorded hundreds of aftershocks during the months of April and May, 2013. In addition to highlighting the primary mainshock rupture plane, aftershocks also appear to be occurring along secondary fault structures adjacent to the main fault trace, illuminating complicated structure, particularly toward the northern extent of the Craig rupture. Focal mechanisms for the larger events recorded during the OBS deployment show both near-vertical strike slip motion consistent with the mainshock mechanism, as well as events with varying strike and a component of normal faulting. Although fault structure along this northern segment of the QCF appears to be considerably simpler than to the south, where a higher degree of oblique convergence leads to sub-parallel compressional deformation structures, secondary faulting structures apparent in legacy seismic reflection data near the Craig rupture may be consistent with the observed seismicity patterns. In combination, these data may help to characterize structural heterogeneity along the northern segment of the Queen Charlotte Fault that contributes to rupture segmentation during large strike slip events.",

In fact, [O], [He] and [N2] have not been measured in-situ in the upper atmosphere since the era of DE-2, and then for only 18 months from 1981-1983 (near solar maximum). Prior to that, the Atmospheric Explorer program (AE-A launched in 1963, AE-E ended in 1980) provided the neutral density information upon which the MSIS model is largely based. No instrument has measured [H] in-situ, which is instead derived in MSIS by solution of the proton continuity equation.\nThe ExoCube satellite provides a long-overdue benchmark for the densities of significant neutral and ionized species in the upper atmosphere, on a global scale, for the Space Weather and Aeronomy communities. These will be the first in-situ global neutral density data since DE-2, including the first direct measurements of [H] using a mass spectrometer technique. Since roughly half of the total electron column content (TEC) arises from photoionization of H, reliable knowledge of exospheric [H] is a crucial requirement of realistic Space Weather modeling of TEC. To insure that this project has enduring impact beyond the projected two-year duration of the satellite mission, experimental interaction with ground-based ISR and optical facilities is integrated. The simultaneous collection of ion and neutral densities will facilitate the use of ExoCube data for studies of charge exchange processes. Overpasses with observatories will enable ExoCube measurements to be used as a constraint for retrieval of density information from forward modeling of ground-based observations. Presented here will be the first post-launch mission status and operations.",

            "abstract": "The internal structure of ophiolite complexes has long been used as a window into the inaccessible parts of the oceanic lithosphere and by inference, processes beneath spreading centers. However, even the best preserved ophiolite complexes have been tilted, folded, faulting and dismembered during post-spreading tectonic events. Some degree of reconstruction is required to restore ophiolite structures to their appropriate relative orientations in order to relate them to processes beneath spreading centers. A number of assumptions about ophiolite structures have been used to guide reconstructions including: lava flows (horizontal, especially sheet-like lavas), dikes in lavas and sheeted dike complexes (vertical and parallel to spreading centers), the contacts between major rock units (horizontal, analogous to the seismic structure of oceanic crust) and the mafic/ultramafic contact representing the geologic expression of the Moho (horizontal). Based in part on these assumptions the internal structure of rock units, metamorphic relationships, and the kinematics of faults and deformation fabrics are also inferred. The spreading direction is seldom constrained in ophiolites making it difficult to assess the geometry of asymmetrical features, such as the dip of dikes, faults, or igneous layering, relative to spreading axes. Observations from exposures of upper crustal rock units (lavas, transition zones, dike and upper gabbroic rocks) along major tectonic escarpments in oceanic crust formed at fast to intermediate rates, as well as the uplifted and glaciated Tertiary basaltic crust of Iceland, raise questions about several of the assumptions used in ophiolite reconstructions. Alternative reconstructions may provide new ideas about spreading processes.",

            "abstract": "Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon (C) reservoir, storing 2,300 Gt C globally, with the largest C input allocated by plant roots. Many root-derived C inputs are low molecular weight compounds (exudates), although complex C compounds from sloughed off cells and decaying roots also contribute precursors to the soil organic matter (SOM) pool. Root-derived compounds are metabolized by microorganisms, using extracellular enzymes to degrade the more complex C compounds. Thus, products of microbial use of root C may be free in soil solution or occur as microbial cell material. Products of root decomposition are stabilized in soil when C compounds are protected from degradation by (i) chemical recalcitrance, (ii) physical protection by aggregation, or (iii) physical-chemical protection by sorption to mineral surfaces. Previous studies show that sorption of SOM to soil minerals can stabilize C compounds for up to thousands of years. We examined the influence of soil mineralogy on sorption of root-derived C. We hypothesized that differences in specific surface area (SSA) and chemical reactivity of four mineral types: goethite, kaolinite, quartz, as well as native minerals extracted from field soil, are significant controls on the rate, quantity, and composition of mineral-sorbed SOM. Soils were collected at the UC Hopland Research and Extension Center in Hopland, CA and planted in soil microcosms with the common annual grass A. barbata; seeds collected from the field site. Microcosms were incubated in a sealed chamber under 13CO2 (99 atom%) for 8 weeks. Plant photosynthesized-C is allocated to the soil via roots, and with the 13C label, allows us to trace the fate of plant-derived C in the soil. Minerals, which were isolated in 18 μm mesh to exclude roots but not microorganisms, were extracted and measured for total C and 13C atom% after a 12 week growing season of A. barbata. Preliminary FTIR and 13C-NMR analysis show differences in the chemical composition of mineral-associated SOM. Understanding the pathway through which SOM is first stabilized by mineral-association in soils, and the influence of soil mineralogy on that pathway, may improve models of soil C cycling and climate change predictions for soil C pools.",

            "abstract": "Soils of the northern permafrost regions store 50% (1672 Pg) of the world’s belowground organic carbon (C). Peatlands within this region store 277 Pg as soil C and often occur as a mosaic of wetland types, each with variable sensitivity to climate change. Permafrost thaw further increases landscape heterogeneity in peatland structure and C function. While end-member stages such as fully intact or fully thawed permafrost are well studied in peatlands, C fluxes are not well constrained in transitional thaw stages that also cover a significant area of these ecosystems. Moreover, changes in the environmental correlates of C fluxes, due to thaw, are not well described and are vital to modeling future changes to C storage of permafrost peatlands. We used 10 thaw stages in a sub-arctic peatland as a space for time substitution to measure changes in CH4 and CO2 fluxes and their correlates. Growing season mean CH4 fluxes showed a large range across the thaw gradient, increasing with thaw, from -1.1 to 370.2 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. CO2 fluxes were highly variable along the thaw gradient with GPMAX (maximum gross photosynthetic CO2 capture at maximum photosynthetically active radiation; PAR) ranging from 2.4 to 8.2 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Across the site, we found significant relationships of C fluxes with the correlates: water table depth, thaw depth, temperature, PAR, vascular green area and water chemistry parameters. Within individual thaw stages, strengths of bivariate environment-C flux correlations changed inconsistently as the thaw progressed. A notable exception, temperature sensitivity of CH4 fluxes, increased linearly with thaw, suggesting a shift from substrate to temperature limitation. However, C fluxes have multiple and interactive controls that are not adequately described by bivariate analyses. We found that interactive effects on C fluxes changed variably along the thaw gradient, showing that transitional stage dynamics differ unpredictably from adjacent or end-member stages. Our results suggest that transitional stages contribute to the large variability of C fluxes in a thawing landscape and may require variable parameterization in models estimating C fluxes from abiotic and biotic controls.",

Elemental stoichiometries in euphotic zone protists can be used as end-members in biogeochemical models for bioactive elements (e.g. Fe, Si) and can provide insight into relationships found in the deep ocean and sediments (e.g. Cd:P, Zn:Si) due to broad and organism-specific geochemical links. Though sub-euphotic zone (e.g. hydrothermal, margin-sourced lateral) inputs and processes are also interesting aspects of these cycles, biological incorporation of TEIs in the euphotic zone is, fundamentally, where “the rubber meets the road.” Using the 2013 Pacific GEOTRACES super stations and Peruvian coastal transect as ecological waypoints, we present and compare results from three methods for studying trace elemental composition of phytoplankton: single-cell synchrotron x-ray fluorescence (SXRF); weak chemical leaching (acetic acid/hydroxylamine); and total chemical digestion (HNO3/HCl/HF). This combination of techniques allows examination of taxon-specific trends in biotic stoichiometry across the Eastern Pacific and also provides traditional bulk chemical metrics for both biotic and bulk shallow particulate composition.",

RBSP-ECT data products derive from the three instrument elements that comprise the suite, which collectively covers the broad energies that define the source and seed populations, the core radiation belts, and also their highest energy ultra-relativistic extensions. These RBSP-ECT instruments include, from lowest to highest energies: the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron (HOPE) sensor, the Magnetic Electron and Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), and the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope (REPT). We provide a brief overview of their principles of operation, as well as a description of the Level 1-3 data products that the HOPE, MagEIS, and REPT instruments produce, both separately and together. We provide a summary of how to access these RBSP-ECT data products at our Science Operation Center and Science Data Center (\nhttp://www.rbsp-ect.lanl.gov/rbsp_ect.php\n) as well as caveats for their use.

            "abstract": "Solar wind electrons are expected to play an important role for energy transport in the solar corona and wind. Solar wind electron velocity distributions exhibit three components: a thermal core, a suprathermal halo, and a magnetic field aligned strahl, which is usually moving away from the Sun. The origin of these non-thermal distributions is unknown. Are such distributions already present in the solar corona or are they only a consequence of the solar wind transport in the interplanetary medium? The answer to these questions is of paramount importance to understand the origin of the solar wind. It requires accurate in situ measurements of the electron properties. Traditional electron analysers generally suffer from spacecraft charging and photoelectron perturbations, but the alternative method of Quasi-Thermal Noise Spectroscopy (QTN), which has been successfully used in various space plasma environments, is immune to these limitations. This method is based on the electrostatic fluctuations induced by the thermal motion of the ambient plasma particles, which can be measured with a sensitive radio wave receiver connected to a wire dipole antenna. As this quasi-thermal noise is completely determined by the particle velocity distributions in the frame of the antenna, QTN is a high-accuracy robust method for determining electron moments together with some non-thermal features. After a short review of the QTN method, we describe its recent developments and how it will be implemented on the upcoming missions Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus. New simulations of QTN measurements in the inner heliosphere are presented for typical expected corona, solar wind and ICMEs conditions down to 9.5 solar radii.",

            "abstract": "In 2007, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory decided to establish a climate science website aimed at explaining what scientists know about climate science, and what they don’t, to the English-speaking public. Because of my prior work in the history of atmospheric and climate sciences, I was asked to help choose the data that would be displayed on the site and to write the basic text. Our site went “live” in 2008, and quickly attracted both widespread media attention and sponsorship from NASA, which funded us to expand it into the NASA Climate Change website, climate.nasa.gov. It’s now generally the 3rd or 4th ranked climate change website in Google rankings. A perusal of the NASA Climate Change website will reveal that the word “uncertainty” does not appear in its explanatory essays. “Uncertainty,” in science, is a calculated quantity. To calculate it, one must know quite a bit about the phenomenon in question. In vernacular use, “uncertainty” means something like “stuff we don’t know.” These are radically different meanings, and yet scientists and their institutions routinely use both meanings without clarification. Even without the deliberate disinformation campaigns that Oreskes and Conway have documented in Merchants of Doubt, scientists’ own misuse of this one word would produce public confusion. We chose to use other words to overcome this one communications problem. But other aspects of the climate communications problem cannot be so easily overcome in a context of Federal agency communications. In this paper, we’ll review recent research on ways to improve public understanding of science, and set it against the restrictions that exist on Federal agency communications—avoidance of political statements and interpretation, focusing on fact over storytelling, narrowness of context—to help illuminate the difficulty of improving public understanding of complex, policy-relevant phenomenon like climate change.",

            "abstract": "The identification and mapping of compositionally (olivine-/pyroxene-enriched), thermophysically (rocky), and morphologically (flat floors with lobate margins, no visible ejecta/central peak) distinct infilled craters over the majority of the martian cratered southern highlands coupled with the ancient formation age of floor materials (~3.5-4Ga) recently resulted in the interpretation that volcanic infilling was the likely responsible process. However, the source of this material is enigmatic, as no vents are observed and these deposits do not occur in association with any specific volcanic or geographic provinces, leading to the proposal that impact excavation-induced decompression melting of a mantle source may be responsible for the intra-crater materials.\nThe conditions under which impact-induced decompression melting occurs, if at all, are not well constrained. In this work, we present the quantitative modeling of this process by coupling the pMELTS thermodynamic model for silicate magmas to a CTH shock physics impact model with realistic rock rheology. Initial conditions are established for early to modern Mars with mantle potential temperatures (1250-1550˚C), surface heat fluxes (20-80 mW/m2) and radiogenic crustal heat production (1x10-10-1.0x10-12 W/kg) with a crustal composition of Adirondack class basalts and mantle composition following Dreibus and Wanke.\nEarly results (~80km lithosphere, 1350˚C mantle potential temperature) show ~5-7% excess melt generated at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary for large craters (e.g. 180 km). These impact events also create zones of high shear strain/fracture systems that propagate through the entire brittle lithosphere. In general the thinner lithosphere and higher mantle potential temperature conditions on early planetary bodies should produce more melt at a given crater size and allow for the translation of this process to smaller crater sizes like those observed on Mars. If pre-existing melt is trapped below a stagnant lithospheric lid, it may also be released through fractures created by the impact. Examining these processes through numerical modeling techniques provides the potential to constrain early planetary evolutionary models by placing constraints on mantle potential temperatures, lithospheric thicknesses, etc.",

Owing to the emission reduction, long-term EPA surface ozone records show a decreasing trend during the summer over the US. However, the records also reveal increasing trends of concentration and variation of ozone during the spring and the fall in many regions of the US, indicating an extension of the ozone season. Here we analyze two cases of high monthly mean extremes over the Southeast: May 2007 and October 2011.We conduct a series of model simulation using the Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM). Although doing a reasonably good job in general, the regional chemical transport model tends to underestimate the ozone by ~ 10 ppbv when relative humidity is low, indicating that a mechanism linking ozone and relative humidity is not represented in the model. The correlation between ozone and relative humidity is verified using 30-year ozone and meteorological data. Previous phytological studies in a controlled environment suggest that the stress under low humidity can stimulate trees to release more biogenic isoprene and this mechanism is not yet included in current biogenic emission algorithms such as MEGAN. Inclusion of this mechanism in the REAM model improves the model performance in the extreme years. We suggest that a drier condition in the future may be a key factor for the extension of the ozone season through the feedback of relative humidity on isoprene emissions. This feedback will also affect the production of secondary organic aerosols from isoprene oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols affect the global energy budget by scattering and absorbing sunlight (direct effects) and by changing the microphysical properties, lifetime, and coverage of clouds (indirect effects). One of the key challenges in quantifying the aerosol direct and indirect effects is to deep our understanding about the size distribution, size-resolved composition, and mixing state of aerosols. However, detailed information on size distribution and mixing state is often not available or incomplete in current climate models. Here, we incorporated APM into CESM. APM is a multi-type, multi-component (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, SOA, BC, OC, dust, and sea salt), size-resolved particle microphysics model. Online chemistry, up-to-date nucleation, oxidation aging of medium-volatile and semi-volatile organic gases, aerosol-cloud interaction with stratiform cloud, shallow convection cloud, and deep convection cloud are considered. The amounts of secondary species coated on primary particles, through condensation, coagulation, equilibrium uptake, and aqueous chemistry, are also tracked. Model results are compared with aerosol mass observed by IMPROVE/EMEP, vertical structure of global particle number from aircraft-based field campaigns, particle and cloud condensation nuclei number at ground-based stations, aerosol optical properties retrieved by several satellites. Model results can capture the major characteristics shown in these observations. With this model system, we find that global burdens of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, BC, OC from 2000 to 2100, under scenario RCP 4.5 where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100, are decreased by 44%, 50%, 43%, 40%, 40%, respectively. Dust and sea salt increase slightly. Global burdens of secondary species coated on BCOC, dust, and sea salt are deceased by 34%, 30% and 60%, respectively. Global averaged aerosol number in the lower troposphere (from surface to 3 km) is significantly decreased, especially for particles smaller than 40 nm. Although secondary particles (SP) are decreased from 2000 to 2100, aerosol number is still dominated by SP. Cloud droplet number in the lower troposphere is decreased 30% from 2000 to 2100. The impacts of the aerosol changes on cloud properties, precipitation, and radiative forcing will be discussed in detail.",

The first fifteen meters of this aquifer have been polluted, due to this the protection of this resource is important because is the only source of potable water of the entire State. Through the assessment of groundwater quality we can gain some knowledge about the main processes governing water chemistry as well as spatial patterns which are important to establish protection zones. In this work multivariate statistical techniques are used to assess the groundwater quality of the supply wells (30 to 40 meters deep) in the hidrogeologic region of the Ring of Cenotes, located in Yucatan, Mexico. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis are applied in groundwater chemistry data of the study area. Results of principal component analysis show that the main sources of variation in the data are due sea water intrusion and the interaction of the water with the carbonate rocks of the system and some pollution processes. The cluster analysis shows that the data can be divided in four clusters. The spatial distribution of the clusters seems to be random, but is consistent with sea water intrusion and pollution with nitrates. The overall results show that multivariate statistical analysis can be successfully applied in the groundwater quality assessment of this karstic aquifer.",

This new approach to K-12 science education requires a dedicated effort to address teacher preparation in ESS. Here, we present an instructional model that explicitly integrates the three dimensions of the NGSS as an organizing framework in large-enrollment, undergraduate introductory geoscience courses targeted toward future teachers. This curriculum development is part of a campus-wide collaboration among science, engineering, and education faculty to enhance science teacher preparation. This approach reflects NGSS conceptual shifts and promotes a learner-centered environment where students regularly engage with each other and course material as part of the course:\n\n1) In terms of content, Earth systems and interactions, are emphasized; rocks and minerals are discussed in the context of their use to understand and predict changes over Earth’s past, present, and future; and engineering and technology are incorporated into discussions of mediating human impacts on Earth systems. 2) Cross-cutting concepts, such as cycles and flows, are explicitly referenced throughout the course to promote connections between and application of prior knowledge and new information or situations. 3) Guided by explicit prompts for partner discussions in class, students regularly engage in scientific practices, such as arguing by evidence and constructing an explanation. We will provide examples of student learning assessment, including in-class responses pre- and post- partner discussions, short written reflections, and cumulative projects. Ongoing evaluation of this instructional approach will include pre- and post- Geoscience Concept Inventory responses.",

In the Christina River Critical Zone Observatory, we use the chemistry of water, in particular the oxygen-18 and chloride concentrations, and hydrograph separation to evaluate the contributions of different water sources to the stream discharge during a series of five storm events in 2011 and 2012. These events varied in magnitude, from 44 to 168 mm total precipitation, and precipitation chemistry, with δ18O values ranging from -5.38 to -11.06 ‰. The contribution of old water during the storm peak, determined by isotope hydrograph separation, varied from 0% in a spring storm of annual magnitude to 76% during Hurricane Sandy. Soil moisture data, available for all but one of our storms, indicates higher old water contribution at peak flow when the catchment has higher antecedent soil moisture.\nUnderstanding differences in water sourcing to the stream during different events provides a basis on which we analyze the movement of critical zone processing with regard to erosion and the source of exported sediment. For example, sediment fingerprinting with fallout radioisotopes indicated variation in sediment source between events. For example, suspended sediment samples taken during Hurricane Irene (28 August 2011) contained between 0 and 11.4 Bq/kg cesium-137 (137Cs) and 175 – 698 Bq/kg of beryllium-7 (7Be), indicating some level of recent surface erosion. Suspended sediment samples taken during Hurricane Sandy (29 October 2012) did not contain measureable activities of either 137Cs or 7Be.",

            "abstract": "The mathematical codes embedded within different vegetation models ultimately represent alternative hypotheses of biosphere functioning. While formulations for some processes (e.g. leaf-level photosynthesis) are often shared across vegetation models, other processes (e.g. carbon allocation) are much more variable in their representation across models. This creates the opportunity for equifinality – models can simulate similar values of key metrics such as NPP or biomass through very different underlying causal pathways. Intensive carbon cycle measurements allow for quantification of a comprehensive suite of carbon fluxes such as the productivity and respiration of leaves, roots and wood, allowing for in-depth assessment of carbon flows within ecosystems. Thus, they provide important information on poorly-constrained C-cycle processes such as allocation. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of the ability of four commonly used dynamic global vegetation models (CLM, ED2, IBIS, JULES) to simulate carbon cycle processes at ten lowland Amazonian rainforest sites where individual C-cycle components have been measured. The rigorous model-data comparison procedure allowed identification of biases which were specific to different models, providing clear avenues for model improvement and allowing determination of internal C-cycling pathways that were better supported by data. Furthermore, the intensive C-cycle data allowed for explicit testing of the validity of a number of assumptions made by specific models in the simulation of carbon allocation and plant respiration. For example, the ED2 model assumes that maintenance respiration of stems is negligible while JULES assumes equivalent allocation of NPP to fine roots and leaves. We argue that field studies focusing on simultaneous measurement of a large number of component fluxes are fundamentally important for reducing uncertainty in vegetation model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Identifying rock composition and properties is imperative in a variety of fields including geotechnical engineering, mining, and petroleum exploration, in order to accurately make any petrophysical calculations. Density is, in particular, an important parameter that allows us to differentiate between lithologies and estimate or calculate other petrophysical properties. It is well established that compressional and shear wave velocities of common crystalline rocks increase with increasing densities (i.e. the Birch and Nafe-Drake relationships). Conventional empirical relations do not take into account S-wave velocity. Physical properties of Fe-oxides and massive sulfides, however, differ significantly from the empirical velocity-density relationships. Currently, acquiring in-situ density data is challenging and problematic, and therefore, developing an approximation for density based on seismic wave velocity and elastic moduli would be beneficial. With the goal of finding other possible or better relationships between density and the elastic moduli, a database of density, P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio was compiled based on a multitude of lab samples. The database is comprised of isotropic, non-porous metamorphic rock. Multi-parameter cross plots of the various elastic parameters have been analyzed in order to find a suitable parameter combination that reduces high density outliers. As expected, the P-wave velocity to S-wave velocity ratios show no correlation with density. However, Birch’s seismic parameter, along with the bulk modulus, shows promise in providing a link between observed compressional and shear wave velocities and rock densities, including massive sulfides and Fe-oxides.",

            "abstract": "Carbonates are ubiquitous in nature, forming in a variety of settings at the surface and through burial. The field and petrographic relationships of carbonate phases can often be linked to the depositional setting and burial path(s) that the sedimentary pile has experienced. Clumped isotopes are taking on an important role of testing the temperature of formation of the carbonates, and combined with other approaches such as fluid inclusion analyses offers tremendous potential for testing basin evolution models. However, while the relative ages of carbonates are often fairly easily elucidated, the absolute ages of the events recorded in carbonates are not. U-Pb dating of carbonates offers the best potential for constraining the ages. However, not all fluids have favorable U/Ca ratios.\nU-Pb dated groundwater carbonates from the Late Triassic New Haven Arkose give an age of 211 +/- 2 Ma, consistent with the known age of deposition. Late bright luminescent calcite from the same formation gives an age of 81+/-11 Ma, constraining the age (both primary and secondary) of carbonate formation. Clumped isotope analyses of primary carbonate phases show somewhat elevated temperatures between 50-60o C, some 30 degrees hotter than other estimates for this Triassic equatorial setting, and are more likely the result of re-ordering of 13C-18O bonds at depth. Apparently the primary calcite, appears to have preserved its depositional U-Pb systematics, however bond re-ordering or recrystallization of these carbonates appear to reflect values closer to thermal equilibrium with the last phase of carbonate formation (bright luminescent calcite, 81 ± 11 Ma). Further work on these samples will target these younger calcites to determine if this later calcite phase records similar temperatures.",

            "abstract": "More than one-third of the United States’ land cover is comprised of rangelands, which support both forage production and livestock grazing. For grasses in both semi-arid and humid environments, small changes in precipitation and temperature, as well as grazing, can have disproportionately larger impacts on ecosystem processes. For example, these areas may experience large response pulses under highly variable precipitation and other potential future changes. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide information on the interactions between management activities, climate and ecosystem processes to inform sustainable rangeland management. The specific objectives of this paper are to (1) evaluate a new carbon allocation strategy for grasses and (2) test the sensitivity of this improved strategy to changes in climate and grazing strategies.\nThe Regional Hydro-ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) is a process-based, watershed-scale model that simulates hydrology and biogeochemical cycling with dynamic soil and vegetation modules. We developed a new carbon allocation algorithm for partitioning net primary productivity (NPP) between roots and leaves for grasses. The ‘hybrid’ approach represents a balance between preferential partitioning due to environmental conditions and age-related growth. We evaluated this new allocation scheme at the point-scale at a variety of rangeland sites in the U.S. using observed biomass measurements and against existing allocation schemes used in RHESSys. Additionally, changes in the magnitude, frequency, and intensity of precipitation and temperature were used to assess ecosystem responses using our new allocation scheme. We found that changes in biomass and NPP were generally more sensitive to changes in precipitation than changes in temperature. At more arid sites, larger percent reductions in historic baseline precipitation affected biomass and NPP more negatively. We incorporated grazing impacts through biomass removal. We found that the recovery of grasses to defoliation was governed primarily through the following parameters: (1) the daily to annual allocation of NPP and (2) the fractional storage of carbohydrates. The latter was more appropriate in balancing seasonal patterns of grazing with enough emergency storage of carbon for regrowth.",

Stoichiometry is a framework based on elemental ratios for understanding how organisms interact within ecosystems. Linking the two has the potential to yield fresh insight about how ecosystems utilize elements and energy. We sought to quantify the link between the stoichiometry of ecosystem metabolism, specifically the C:N:P ratios of integrated autotrophic assimilation, and the stoichiometric tissue ratios observed in the dominant autotrophs. Using high frequency in situ nutrient sensors we estimated the assimilatory fluxes of C, N, and P in multiple spring-fed rivers of varying autotrophic species composition. We measured autotroph cover in each spring river, collected composite vegetation samples, and evaluated tissue stoichiometry; as expected, we observed large differences in C:N and N:P between algal and vascular plant taxa. We observed associations between measured tissue stoichiometry and elemental ratios at the ecosystem scale, suggesting that aggregated assimilatory fluxes may be useful for partitioning primary production and linking organismal nutrient content to the stoichiometry of ecosystem metabolism.",

Charcoal accumulation rates, a proxy for palaeofire records, were obtained in sediment cores from Amazon lakes surrounded by several vegetation types and from a reservoir in an intense land use change region. The records presented in this study were obtained in the following areas i) a reservoir in Alta Floresta region (northern Mato Grosso State); ii) Lago do Saci (southern Pará State), a lake close to Alta Floresta and located at the southern border of Pará State; iii) a bog in an ecotone area in the Humaitá region (southern Amazonas State); iv) lakes in lateritic iron crust of the Carajás Hills (southeastern Pará State); v) Lago Comprido, a floodplain lake close to the Amazon River and surrounded by tropical rain forest (Monte Alegre, Pará State; vi) Lagoa da Pata in the Morro dos Seis Lagos alkaline complex (São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State) and vii) Lago Caracaranã, a secluded lake in the northern Amazon cerrado (Roraima State). The highest charcoal accumulation rates were observed for modern records related to an intense change in land use at Alta Floresta, which had no precedent during the Holocene history of the Amazon. High charcoal accumulation rates that were observed in the Carajás region during low lake level phases in the Amazon in the mid-Holocene were comparable to those at the onset of the human settlement in Alta Floresta region. An increase in charcoal accumulation rate was observed in the late Holocene when the lake level was high, suggesting an interaction between climates and human presence. Low charcoal accumulation rates are typical of modern high rainfall environments, as observed in Lagoa da Pata where the environment is not susceptible to occurrences of wildfires even during relatively drier climatic phases. Low charcoal accumulation rates also exist in the relatively dry cerrado (savanna type) biome even during relatively dry phases in the Caracaranã region where the savanna-type vegetation biomass is lower and thus generates less charcoal particles than forest ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The Earth Science Women’s Network (ESWN) is an international peer-mentoring organization with over 2000 members, dedicated to career development and community for women across the geosciences. Since its formation in 2002, ESWN has supported the growth of a more diverse scientific community through a combination of online and in-person networking activities. Lessons learned related to online networking and community-building will be presented.\nESWN serves upper-level undergraduates, graduate students, professionals in a range of environmental fields, scientists working in federal and state governments, post-doctoral researchers, and academic faculty and scientists. Membership includes women working in over 50 countries, although the majority of ESWN members work in the U.S. ESWN increases retention of women in the geosciences by enabling and supporting professional person-to-person connections. This approach has been shown to reduce feelings of isolation among our members and help build professional support systems critical to career success.\nIn early 2013 ESWN transitioned online activities to an advanced social networking platform that supports discussion threads, group formation, and individual messaging. Prior to that, on-line activities operated through a traditional list-serve, hosted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The new web center, http://eswnonline.org, serves as the primary forum for members to build connections, seek advice, and share resources. For example, members share job announcements, discuss issues of work-life balance, and organize events at professional conferences. ESWN provides a platform for problem-based mentoring, drawing from the wisdom of colleagues across a range of career stages.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests such as the forests of the Amazon basin are a significant component of the earth’s carbon budget, yet how these forests respond to seasonal changes in weather, along with the extent to which tree biology synchronizes with seasonal cycles, are poorly understood.\nFor evergreen forests in equatorial Amazon that experience dry seasons, most global vegetation models project a dry-season decrease in gross primary productivity (GPP). However, eddy covariance observations and remote sensing assessments suggest a late-dry season increase in GPP.\nMost global vegetation models assume that there is no seasonal variation in leaf phenology (cycles of leaf flush and senescence), or in leaf physiology. We conducted a case study in the Tapajos National Forest KM67 site, near Santarém, Brazil, to investigate whether leaf aging and seasonal shifts in leaf demography could cause an increase in GPP during the dry season. In a series of fieldwork campaigns beginning in August 2012, we monitored leaf demographic composition (leaf age categories) from 1-m branches collected from 20 trees representing abundant species, and we assessed how photosynthesis varies with leaf age for a subset of these trees.\nOur results show that photosynthetic capacity (e.g. Vcmax) is higher for leaves that matured during the most recent dry season than for older leaves from previous periods of growth. For many trees, leaf demography shifted during the dry season such that recently matured leaves replaced old leaves. For instance, leaf demography of an Erisma uncinatum, the most abundant canopy tree species at our site, had significantly more recently matured leaves, and significantly fewer old leaves, during surveys late in the dry season (after mid-October) than early in the dry season (prior to mid-September). These results suggest that shifts in leaf demography together with the effects of leaf age on leaf physiology can increase GPP during the dry season at the KM67 site. Thus, leaf phenology may be a dominant driver of GPP seasonality in moist tropical forests of the equatorial Amazon.",

It is the one parameter controlling the decay of the high-frequency part of the seismic spectrum and, although still debated, it is most frequently related to the site effect. In the present study, we use the lower-magnitude earthquake records in the EUROSEISTEST database (http://euroseisdb.civil.auth.gr) to compute site-specific “kappa” and then predict larger-magnitude earthquake records through stochastic simulations. We emphasize the proper use of “kappa” when it is combined with empirical transfer functions that have resulted from Standard Spectral Ratios (SSR) or Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratios (HVSR), as these functions already include part of the “kappa” effect. Furthermore, we discuss the scatter in “kappa” measurements in relation to the site class and the distance to the earthquake source, and present examples of the possible effect of such scatter in simulated ground motion.",

            "abstract": "Although seismic velocity generally reflects material density, density models drawn solely from seismic interpretations suffer from the fact that temperature, melt-depletion, variations in quartz content, and in-situ melt—as well as myriad other factors—have different effects on the relationship between velocity and density. To wit, such models generally do not accurately recover gravity and/or topography variations. We have developed a probabilistic density modeling method that estimates density from seismic velocity and heat flow and refines these initial estimates in order to reproduce gravity and topography, accounting for lithospheric flexure. Both the input seismic velocity modeling and the refinement are Monte Carlo-type approaches, so the posterior distribution of models provides a direct measure of uncertainty. We leverage the aforementioned difference in sensitivity to separate density variations into thermal and compositional components, providing information on the chemistry and physical state of the crust and upper mantle. Using this approach and Transportable Array seismic data, we present a density model of the western US lithosphere (from central Kansas west) to a depth of 150 km that reveals: 1) remarkably uniform, near- to supra-solidus mantle temperatures beneath regions deformed in the Cenozoic--including the Colorado Plateau--that are ~400 °C higher than those beneath the nominally stable interior of North America; 2) crustal melt (~1%) beneath Miocene-Recent volcanic provinces; 3) depleted mantle lithosphere beneath the Wyoming craton and northern High Plains; 4) likely hydrated lower crust in the Colorado Plateau and Great Plains; and 5) that horizontal differences in lithostatic pressure create deviatoric extensional stress of ~10 MPa in the northern Basin and Range and along the margins of the Colorado Plateau. This density model is a rich source of information, shedding light on the causes and consequences of tectonism, crust-mantle interactions, and topography in the western US.",

            "abstract": "Characteristic for the substorm growth phase is enhanced dayside reconnection with the implications of lowering the total closed magnetic flux and increasing the open flux in the tail lobes. It is demonstrated that the depletion of closed flux in the near Earth magnetotail and the increase of open lobe magnetic flux can lead to the evolution of two separate very thin current sheets in the near Earth and the mid tail regions of the magnetosphere. The relative intensity and width of these current sheets depends on the details of the flux circulation and additional solar wind properties. Both of these current sheets can lead to the onset of magnetic reconnection. We discuss the physics of the dual current sheet formation and implications for the properties of magnetic reconnection in either current sheet. It is suggested that only reconnection onset in the near Earth current sheet may be consistent with substorm expansion because the flux tube entropy depletion of mid tail reconnection appears insufficient to cause geosynchronous particle injection and dipolarization. Therefore reconnection in the mid tail current sheet is more likely associated with flux tube entropy depleted bursty bulk flows.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that throughout the central and eastern U.S. there has been a marked increase in seismicity since 2009, at least some of which appears to increased wastewater injection. No area has seen a greater increase in seismicity than Oklahoma. In this paper, we utilize newly available information on in situ stress orientation and relative magnitudes, the distribution of high volume injection wells and knowledge of the intervals used for waste water disposal to identify the factors potentially contributing to the occurrence of triggered seismicity. While there are a number of sites where in situ stress data has been successfully used to identify potentially active faults, we are investigating whether this methodology can be implemented throughout a state utilizing the types of information frequently available in areas of oil and gas development. As an initial test of this concept, we have been compiling stress orientation data from wells throughout Oklahoma provided by private industry. Over fifty new high quality data points, principally drilling-induced tensile fractures observed in image logs, result in a greatly improved understanding of the stress field in much of the state. A relatively uniform ENE direction of maximum compressive stress is observed, although stress orientations (and possibly relative stress magnitudes) differ in the southern and southwestern parts of the state. The proposed methodology can be tested in the area of the NE-trending fault that produced the M 5+ earthquakes in the Prague, OK sequence in 2011, and the Meers fault in southwestern OK, that produced a M~7 reverse faulting earthquake about 1100 years ago. This methodology can also be used to essentially rule out slip on other major faults in the area, such as the ~N-S trending Nemaha fault system. Additional factors leading to the occurrence of relatively large triggered earthquakes in Oklahoma are 1) the overall increase in injection volumes throughout the state in recent years (especially in some particular areas) 2) the injection of waste water in a geologic formation laying directly above crystalline basement rocks and 3) the widespread distribution of injection wells.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and timely information on rice crop growth and yield helps governments and other stakeholders adapting their economic policies and enables relief organizations to better anticipate and coordinate relief efforts in the wake of a natural catastrophe. Such delivery of rice growth and yield information is made possible by regular earth observation using space-born Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology combined with crop modeling approach to estimate yield. Radar-based remote sensing is capable of observing rice vegetation growth irrespective of cloud coverage, an important feature given that in incidences of flooding the sky is often cloud-covered. The system allows rapid damage assessment over the area of interest. Rice yield monitoring is based on a crop growth simulation and SAR-derived key information, particularly start of season and leaf growth rate. Results from pilot study sites in South and South East Asian countries suggest that incorporation of SAR data into crop model improves yield estimation for actual yields. Remote-sensing data assimilation into crop model effectively capture responses of rice crops to environmental conditions over large spatial coverage, which otherwise is practically impossible to achieve. Such improvement of actual yield estimates offers practical application such as in a crop insurance program. Process-based crop simulation model is used in the system to ensure climate information is adequately captured and to enable mid-season yield forecast.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis have inflicted death and destruction on the coastlines of the world throughout history. The occurrence of tsunamis and the resulting effects have been collected and studied as far back as the second millennium B.C. The knowledge gained from cataloging and examining these events has led to significant changes in our understanding of tsunamis, tsunami sources, and methods to mitigate the effects of tsunamis. The most significant, not surprisingly, are often the most devastating, such as the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake and tsunami. The goal of this poster is to give a brief overview of the occurrence of tsunamis and then focus specifically on several significant tsunamis. There are various criteria to determine the most significant tsunamis: the number of deaths, amount of damage, maximum runup height, had a major impact on tsunami science or policy, etc. As a result, descriptions will include some of the most costly (2011 Tohoku, Japan), the most deadly (2004 Sumatra, 1883 Krakatau), and the highest runup ever observed (1958 Lituya Bay, Alaska). The discovery of the Cascadia subduction zone as the source of the 1700 Japanese “Orphan” tsunami and a future tsunami threat to the U.S. northwest coast, contributed to the decision to form the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. The great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 marked the beginning of the modern era of seismology. Knowledge gained from the 1964 Alaska earthquake and tsunami helped confirm the theory of plate tectonics. The 1946 Alaska, 1952 Kuril Islands, 1960 Chile, 1964 Alaska, and the 2004 Banda Aceh, tsunamis all resulted in warning centers or systems being established.\n\nThe data descriptions on this poster were extracted from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) global historical tsunami database.

            "abstract": "Over the years, there have been frequent reports of a dependence of hydraulic conductivity (K) estimates on test volume (scale). This dependence is commonly demonstrated using results from laboratory permeameter tests and from slug and pumping tests. Typically, K estimates from pumping tests are reported to be considerably larger than those from slug tests, which, in turn, are considerably larger than those from permeameter tests. Despite the large body of evidence, a key question remains unresolved – is this relationship produced by methodological differences or a natural underlying scale dependence in K? The most effective means to resolve this question is to use a single technique that can be configured to span orders of magnitude in test scale. The constant-rate pumping test is just such a technique. In the first few minutes to tens of minutes of pumping, the affected volume is relatively small. In contrast, after days of pumping, this volume can be orders of magnitude larger. If there is an underlying scale dependence, it should be revealed by K estimates determined from different durations of pumping. We have been investigating this issue using pumping tests in unconsolidated aquifers in central and western Kansas. In western Kansas, irrigation wells are pumped nearly continuously for the entire growing season. If nearby observation wells are available, we can use this near-continuous pumping as a long-duration, albeit imperfectly controlled, pumping test to increase the scale of the investigation. An initial assessment of these formal and ad-hoc pumping tests has found no evidence of a scale dependence in K; these tests are typically characterized by homogeneous aquifer behavior at small to moderate times of pumping after which boundary effects become dominant. Thus, if there is an underlying scale dependence, it is below the scale of these observations, which would have to be considered rather serendipitous. We can assess the relationship at smaller scales by placing observation wells immediately adjacent to the pumping well and by relating slug tests to pumping tests in the same well using deconvolution approaches. Although further work is needed to finally resolve this long-standing conundrum, we have seen no indication that the reported dependence is a reflection of an underlying scale dependence in K.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial biosphere models are being used to forecast ecosystem response to future climate change. However, the predictions of these models do not agree, and their ability to accurately represent decadal- and longer-scale ecological processes has rarely been tested.\nHere we investigate how the structure of the terrestrial biosphere models affects their ability to accurately simulate vegetation dynamics over the past 1000 years. Six models and model variations are involved, including the Ecosystem Demography 2 model (ED2), the Community Land Model (CLM4.0, CLM4.5, CLM4.5-dynamic vegetation), and the Lund-Postdam-Jena models (LPJ-GUESS and LPJ-wsl). Using common paleoclimatic drivers and modeling protocols, we simulated vegetation changes in the northeastern US with these models for the past 1000 years. We compared the model outputs with paleoecological/historical benchmark datasets (paleo-vegetation data reconstructed from fossil pollen records and pre-EuroAmerican vegetation data from the Public Land Survey and Town Proprietor Surveys) to evaluate model performance. We characterized the models based on how they represented photosynthesis, water relations, soil, biogeochemical cycling, and vegetation dynamics.\nModels with similar structures behaved more similarly over time; we found that model attributes of both fast (e.g. photosynthesis) and slow processes (e.g. vegetation dynamics) affect model long-term predictions. However, the effect of model attributes varies among regions and across time.\nIn addition to model structure, parameter uncertainty among models also appears to contribute to the differences in model output. We are currently working on assimilating paleoecological data into a subset of the terrestrial biosphere models to constrain the key model parameters and state variables, and in turn, to better evaluate the effect of model structure alone on model performance.",

            "abstract": "Many coastlines throughout the world are in a net erosional state due to factors such as climate change and anthropogenic activities. While most coastal erosion occurs episodically during major storms, beaches recover during extended periods of low wave energy. Despite the importance of beach recovery on limiting coastal vulnerability, the mechanisms driving onshore sediment transport are much less well understood than those of storm-driven offshore transport. Intertidal bar (i.e., swash bar) welding to the shoreline is one proposed mechanism of sediment delivery from the nearshore to the backshore. However, studies of swash bars and their contribution to beach building have been scarce because of the sporadic nature of these events and difficulty measuring sediment fluxes in the intertidal zone.\nSeveral beaches in the US Pacific Northwest are prograding rapidly in part due to highly dissipative conditions and an abundant sediment supply. For example, at South Beach State Park (SBSP) in Newport, OR the shoreline accreted at an average of 6 m/yr from 1960 to 2002. To explore the role of intertidal bar welding on supplying sediment to this dynamic backshore, we recently completed a boutique field experiment at SBSP. Topographic and bathymetric surveys carried out over 9 months document the short term (<weekly) through seasonal responses to the nearshore planform (-15m to +10m). A mooring was deployed offshore SBSP to measure waves, currents, suspended sediment concentrations, and the density structure of the water column to characterize the environmental conditions driving the observed morphologic changes. A co-located X-band marine radar and meteorological station provide information regarding spatially complex wave transformations and the forces driving aeolian sediment transport, respectively.\nOur observations at SBSP indicate a dynamic coastal landscape including multiple nearshore bars. During the experiment we observed onshore migration of the subtidal bars, significant changes to the swash bar system, and progradation of the subaerial beach. With this new dataset we are exploring the importance of intertidal bar welding on supplying sediment to the backshore as well as the environmental conditions and physical mechanisms that promote onshore delivery of sediment.",

Articles and blogs tout the need for “expert” skill levels in domain knowledge, statistics, storytelling, graphic design, technology…and the list goes on. Since it seems impossible that one person would encompass all these skills, it is often suggested that data science be done by a team instead of an individual.\nThis research into, and experience with, data product design offers an augmented definition – one that elevates relationships and engagement with the final user of a product. Essentially, no matter how fantastic or technically advanced a product appears, the intended audience of that product must be able to understand, use, and find value in the product in order for it to be considered a success. Usability is often misunderstood and seen as common sense or common knowledge, but it is actually an important and challenging piece of product development.\nThis paper describes the National Snow and Ice Data Center's process to usability test the Arctic Data Explorer (ADE). The ADE is a federated data search tool for interdisciplinary Arctic science data that has been improved in features, appearance, functionality, and quality through a series of strategic and targeted usability testing and assessments. Based on the results, it is recommended that usability testing be incorporated into the skill set of each data science team.",

            "abstract": "Since 2004, a sequence of devastating tsunamis has taken the lives of more than 300,000 people worldwide. The path of destruction left by each is typically measured in hundreds of meters to a few kilometers and its breadth can extend for hundreds even thousands of kilometers, crossing towns and countries and even traversing an entire oceanic basin. Tsunami disasters in Indonesia, Chile, Japan and elsewhere have also shown that the almost binary nature of tsunami impacts can present some unique risk reduction, response, recovery and rebuilding challenges, with transferable lessons to other tsunami vulnerable coastal communities around the world. In particular, the trauma can motivate survivors to relocate homes, jobs, and even whole communities to safer ground, sometimes at tremendous social and financial costs. For governments, the level of concentrated devastation usually exceeds the local capacity to respond and thus requires complex inter-governmental arrangements with regional, national and even international partners to support the recovery of impacted communities, infrastructure and economies. Two parallel projects underway in California since 2011—the SAFRR (Science Application for Risk Reduction) tsunami scenario project and the California Tsunami Policy Working Group (CTPWG)—have worked to digest key lessons from recent tsunami disasters, with an emphasis on identifying gaps to be addressed in the current state and federal policy framework to enhance tsunami risk awareness, hazard mitigation, and response and recovery planning ahead of disaster and also improve post-disaster implementation practices following a future California or U.S. tsunami event.",

            "abstract": "Quaternary large-volume travertine deposits in New Mexico and Arizona occur along the Rio Grande rift and on the southeastern Colorado Plateau. Travertines are natural analogues for CO2 leakage along fault systems because they form due to the degassing of CO2 from carbonic groundwater that migrates up fault systems. Travertine volumes can be used to infer integrated CO2 leakage along faults, which includes: (1) CO2 that becomes fixed in CaCO3/travertine (tons of carbon converted into tons of carbonate), (2) the amount of CO2 that degassed into the atmosphere (twice the amount of (1), based on reaction stoichiometry), (3) dissolved CO2 that is carried away with the water discharging from a spring (based on modern spring discharge and dissolved carbon content), and (4) CO2 that escapes through the soil (based on modern soil flux measurements). The total CO2 leakage (1 and 2) calculated in this study is estimated as ~6 Gt (gigatons) whereas the integrated CO2 leakage (1-4) is estimated as ~128 Gt over ~450,000 years of travertine accumulation. U-series dating of the travertines shows that the deposits formed episodically which implies that CO2 leakage occurred episodically. Better understanding of integrated CO2 leakage along fault systems is needed to better constrain global estimates of natural CO2 fluxes, and to help in risk assessment of CO2 sequestration sites designed to effectively store anthropogenic CO2 in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "During slope-scale erosion events, soil fractions and the associated soil organic carbon (SOC) will be transported away from eroding sites mainly by overland flow. Eroded soil will be either gradually re-deposited along hillslopes or further transferred to river systems. However, the re-distribution of eroded SOC during transport is not always uniform, but very often affected by preferential deposition. Under given flow conditions, the site of SOC deposition depends on the transport distances of sediment particles where the SOC is stored. Very often, soil and SOC erosion risk is assessed by applying the mineral particle specific SOC distribution observed either from eroding sites or colluvial depositional sites. However, soil is not always eroded as dispersed mineral particles, but mostly in form of aggregates. The aggregates possibly have distinct settling velocity from individual mineral particles, which may considerably change the transport distance of the associated SOC. Yet, little has been known about the potential effects of aggregation onto the movement and mineralizing susceptibility of eroded SOC.\nA simulated rainfall was applied to two soils of different texture, structure and SOC content. The generated sediments were fractionated by a settling tube apparatus according to their likely transport distances. The long-term mineralization potentials of the fractionated sediments were measured for 50 days. The results show: 1) the re-deposition of eroded SOC into the terrestrial system was increased up to 64% compared to the likely re-distribution suggested by the mineral particle specific SOC distribution. This indicates that using mineral particle size distribution and the associated SOC as in current erosion models would under-estimate terrestrial deposition of SOC. 2) Over 50 days, the mineralization of the sediment from the silty loam was doubled when compared to the original silty loam. The mineralization of the sediment from the silty clay roughly equaled that from the original Movelier soil. This requires investigation on the potential effects of different degrees of aggregation onto the fate of eroded SOC. Overall, the results observed from this study suggest that soil erosion is more likely to be a source of atmospheric CO2.",

A 6-month deployment of wave and tide gauges across two shore-normal sections of north-facing coral reef on the Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein Atoll was conducted during 2013-2014 to quantify wave dynamics and wave-driven water levels on the fringing coral reef. Wave heights and periods on the reef flat were strongly correlated to the water levels. On the fore reef, the majority of wave energy was concentrated in the incident band (5-25 s); due to breaking at the reef crest, however, the wave energy over the reef flat was dominated by infragravity-band (25-250 s) motions. Two large wave events with heights of 6-8 m at 15 s over the fore reef were observed. During these events, infragravity-band wave heights exceeded the incident band wave heights and approximately 1.0 m of set-up was established over the innermost reef flat. This set-up enabled the propagation of large waves across the reef flat, reaching maximum heights of nearly 2 m on the innermost reef flat adjacent to the toe of the beach. XBEACH models of the instrument transects were able to replicate the incident waves, infragravity waves, and wave-driven set-up across the reef when the hydrodynamic roughness of the reef was correctly parameterized. These events led to more than 3 m of wave-driven run-up and inundation of the island that drove substantial morphological change to the beach face.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, represent a unique geologic setting where permanent lakes, ephemeral streams, and subglacial waters influence surface hydrology in a cold polar desert. Past research suggested that the MDV are underlain by several hundreds of meters of permafrost. Here, we present data collected from an Airborne EM (AEM) resistivity sensor flown over the MDV during the 2011-12 austral summer. A focus of our survey was over the Taylor Glacier where saline, iron-rich subglacial fluid releases at the glacier snout at a feature known as Blood Falls, and over Taylor Valley, where a series of isolated lakes lie between Taylor Glacier and the Ross Sea. Our data show that in Taylor Valley there are extensive areas of low resistivity, interpreted as hypersaline brines, beneath a relatively thin layer of high resistivity material, interpreted as dry- or ice-cemented permafrost. These hypersaline brines remain liquid at temperatures well below 0°C due to their salinity. They appear to be contained within the sedimentary fill deposited in Taylor Valley when it was still a fjord. This brine system continues up valley and has a subglacial extension beneath Taylor Glacier, where it may provide the source that feeds Blood Falls. By categorizing the resistivity measurements according to surficial land cover, we are able to distinguish between ice, permafrost, lake water, and seawater based on characteristic resistivity distributions. Furthermore, this technique shows that areas of surface permafrost become increasingly conductive (brine-filled) with depth, whereas the large lakes exhibit taliks that extend through the entire thickness of the permafrost. The subsurface brines represent a large, unstudied and potentially connected hydrogeologic system, in which subsurface flows may help transfer water and nutrients between lakes in the MDV and into the Ross Sea. Such a system is a potential habitat for extremophile life, similar to that already detected in the Blood Falls outflow, and may serve as a terrestrial analogue to potential extraterrestrial habits, where liquid surface waters are not expected to exist.",

            "abstract": "As in other semi-arid plains of the world, long-scale deforestation to establish croplands in the South American Chaco may disrupt the regional water balance. As annual crops use less water than the native perennial system, water in excess usually translates into serious degradation processes such as run-off driven erosion, or the onset of groundwater recharge which can develop flooding and dryland salinization. Agriculturally, water excess could be reduced by using more intensive crop systems which consume water exhaustively. We used MODIS imagery (2000-present) from Bandera, Argentina (28.8S 62.2W), a major agricultural cluster in the region, to assess deforestation, to identify the main crop systems, and to analyze the impact of crop expansion and phenological shifts on the regional water balance. Three cover classes (Dry Forest DF, Agriculture AG, and Pastures PA) and five AG crop types were distinguished (winter W, spring Sp,summer S, and late-summer LS single crops, winter/summer DCWS and spring/summer DCSpS double crops). Each season, water use (annual evapotranspiration, ET) for each cover/crop type (10 pixels/class) was computed with a daily water balance based on meteorological data and 2 remote sensing-derived indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, to capture canopy conditions, and Dead Fuel Index to represent mulch cover conditions. Throughout 14 crop seasons AG expanded from 20 to 50% of the study area (1M ha) mostly replacing DF. Also, AG gradually evolved from a more intensive and diversified pattern dominated by DC (45-50%), S (28%) and Sp (16%) systems, to a more water-conservative system dominated by LS (60-80% in the last 3 seasons). Crop type differences in ET (DCWS≈DCSpS≈FG>S>Sp>LS≈W) were stronger in wet years (>1000mm) but nil in dry ones (<550mm). As a result, water excess (precipitation-ET) ranged from 0mm for most crop types in the driest year to >250mm for the less intensive W and LS in wet years. Weighting each cover/crop class by their area, we found that the current expansion and reduced intensity of cultivation has cut regional ET of wet years by 50-100mm (compared to early 2000s land cover/crop pattern in similar weather conditions), generating a growing water excess that is likely contributing to drive the water table rises and more frequent floods observed in this region.",

            "abstract": "Rhyolites are a significant component of continental magmatism of Oregon for the last 40 million years. Rhyolites of all time slices are compositionally diverse ranging from low to high-silica rhyolites, from less fractionated rhyolites with high Ba concentrations (≥1300 ppm Ba) and weak Eu anomalies (>0.4 Eu/Eu*) to strongly fractionated rhyolites with very low Ba contents (≤100 ppm) but strong Eu anomalies (≤0.2 Eu/Eu*), and rhyolites range from Fe-rich, A-type rhyolites to calc-alkaline varieties. In this study, we focus on one compositional end member of rhyolites that is characterized by very low concentrations of high field strength elements (HFSE) designated here as low HFSE rhyolites. Such low HFSE rhyolites contain Nb and Ta contents of 8–13 ppm and 0.8–1.1 ppm, respectively, and Zr and Hf concentrations of 60–150 ppm and 2.5–4 ppm, respectively. The significance of these low HFSE concentrations is that they are consistent with partial melting of observed crustal rocks but not with fractionation of observed mafic magmas.\nCompilation of chemical data of Cenozoic mafic magmas across Oregon indicate that the vast majority of basaltic rocks contain Nb and Zr contents in excess of 5 and 100 ppm, respectively. Only the most primitive high-Al olivine basalts have concentrations as low as 1 and 40 ppm. Basaltic magmas generate rhyolitic liquids after ~90-95% crystallization (e.g., as seen in lava lakes). After such high amounts of crystallization using basaltic magmas from Oregon, Nb and Zr contents would be far in excess of what is observed in these low HFSE rhyolites as both elements will behave incompatibly (strongly to moderately) during fractionation to rhyolites. Also, there are chemical and petrographic arguments that neither late titanite nor zircon fractionation in rhyolites caused low HFSE contents. Although lesser amounts of fractionation would be needed starting with an andesitic composition, HFSE contents of most andesites are already on levels as in low HFSE rhyolites. This indicates pure fractionation scenarios from mafic magmas to yield low HFSE rhyolites are implausible. On the other hand, there are intermediate to silicic crustal rocks with appropriately low HFSE contents that can yield rhyolite liquids during partial melting with or without restitic zircon.",

            "abstract": "Pyrope (Mg3Al2Si3O12) rich garnet is the most important secondary mineral phase with volume fractions ranging between 20 % in the shallow upper mantle to 40 % in the lower part of upper mantle. The volume fractions of garnet in subducted oceanic crusts are as high as 80 %. However, our understanding of the incorporation of water in garnet as proton defect is rather limited. Experimental studies conducted at pressures and temperatures relevant to the deep lower mantle have resulted in wide range of water contents ranging between 0 wt % to ~ 0.8 wt %. In a pyriolyte composition representative of the upper mantle, unlike olivine (Mg2SiO4), which remains largely iso-chemical upon compression, garnet undergoes solid solution with pyroxene (MgSiO3) and as a result there is a continuous evolution of the chemistry of garnet as a function of pressure. This complicates the analysis of proton defects using conventional thermodynamics expressing water solubility as a function of water fugacity, oxide activity, and activation volume.\nTo circumvent this issue, we use first principles simulations to explore the relative energetics of the formation of protons in Mg, Al, and Si sites. Preliminary results at ambient conditions indicate positive enthalpy changes for the proton defects in all the sites, with silicon site being the most favorable. We intend to explore the effect of pressure and temperature on the defect formation energies.\nAcknowledgement- MM is supported by the US National Science Foundation grant (EAR-1250477).",

            "abstract": "The measurement of U-series isotopes in precipitated minerals such as calcite holds various challenges, including low U and Th concentrations (in the ppb-ppt range), and the presence of detrital 232Th which can lead to age overestimations. Additionally, as yet there does not exist a calcite standard reference material for inter-laboratory accuracy and precision comparison, with most laboratories using their own in-house standard material and focussing largely on application to paleoclimate studies (e.g. corals and speleothems). In actively deforming regions, high-pressure hydrothermal fluids play an important role in faulting and vein formation, and commonly fault rupture is followed by rapid sealing through mineral precipitation. Therefore, precise dating of vein growth is of special importance to our understanding of the complex interplay between seismic events and fluid flow in the upper crust, and opens up a new field of study using U-Th techniques. The ability to accurately date fault-filling calcite within such settings has the power to elucidate the connection between structure and fluid flow in the development of geothermal systems, and provide valuable information on the longevity of the heat/water source, in addition to regional magmatic history. We are developing U-Th measurements and ages of vein calcite from geothermal systems using a Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS (with 5 CDDs and 3 SEMs) coupled to an excimer 193nm Photon Machines laser. We will be comparing our results with an 189ka in-house flowstone calcite standard previously dated by TIMS, as well as developing a geothermal calcite standard.",

            "abstract": "Aluminum and Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, as well as sulfates, are abundant in the layered sediments of the central mound of Gale Crater on Mars. Each of these mineral types are useful indicators of depositional conditions regarding pH, where Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates form in higher pH waters, while Al-phyllosilicates and sulfates form in more acidic waters. A general succession from higher pH aquatic environments to lower pH environments is evident during the Noachian and early Hesperian (3.6~3.8 Ga). However, substantial interbedding of these mineral groups is also observed at Gale, indicating pH boundaries that existed contemporaneously at the time of deposition. This is consistent with mineral distributions that are observed in ephemeral lakes on Earth, making them useful as analogs to the geochemistry of Gale Crater. This study will analyze the surficial mineral depositional patterns at Lake Gilmore, WA, to better understand how pH gradients are represented in contemporaneous sediment deposits. This will be performed by identifying minerals based on their unique reflectance signatures in the visible to near-infrared range (0.5-2.5 mm). Reflectance data collected by the HyMap™ hyperspectral scanner will be analyzed using the ENVI software to map the predominant minerals present on the lakebed surface. We expect to see minerals associated with a pH gradient that is related to lake depth, with Fe and alkali earth phyllosilicates representing deeper, less acidic waters, and aluminous phyllosilicates and sulfates representing near surface waters that are more acidic. This is potentially due to the circulation of upwelling groundwaters, or the change in chemistry may have arisen due to microbial activity, an intriguing possibility that would have significant implications for evidence of past microbial life on the Martian surface and would provide a more detailed picture of the paleoenvironment at Gale Crater.",

            "abstract": "The growth process of old ocean lithosphere has long been debated. Thermal models have included half-space conductive cooling, constant thickness cooling plate models with heat supplied to the base of the lithosphere by small-scale convection, and half-space cooling disrupted by impinging plumes. Seafloor subsidence and heat flux values for seafloor ages above 80 Ma are satisfied by the plate model, but previous Rayleigh wave studies have shown that thickening of the plate extends deeper than expected for those models. However, there is a lack of data from sufficiently old seafloor to describe end-member upper mantle structure in areas that have not been reheated by hotspot activity. We analyze Rayleigh wave data obtained from the PLATE project (Pacific Lithosphere Anisotropy and Thickness Experiment), where the seafloor is 150-160 Ma and has not been resurfaced by subsequent volcanism. Rayleigh wave phase velocities for periods from 18 to 125 s are inverted for shear wave velocities to study upper mantle structure. Shear velocities in the western region of our study area reach approximately 5.0 km/s in the top 20 km of the lithosphere and slightly higher in the eastern region. These velocities are higher than any reported in regional or global studies of the oceanic lithosphere that have poorer lateral resolution. These velocities are consistent with those predicted for conductive cooling of old, dehydrated oceanic lithosphere in previous petrologic studies. Shear wave velocities show a negative velocity gradient from 30 to 150 km depth, reaching a minimum velocity of ~4.3 km/s in the asthenospheric low velocity zone. Overall, the velocity structure for our study area beneath old oceanic seafloor is very similar to that predicted for a cooling half-space.",

            "abstract": "Effective reaction rates in porous media are controlled by the spatial organization of chemical species concentrations at the pore scale. From high resolution millifluidic pore scale imaging of reactive tracers we report experimental evidence of the formation of well-developed lamellar structures in reactive mixtures transported through porous media (de Anna et al., Environ. Sci. Technol., 2014). The latter are highlighted by a chemioluminescent reaction producing photons that localize along spatially coherent lines, representing hotspots of mixing and reaction at pore scale. These elongated spatial structures are naturally created by the stretching action of the pore scale velocity field, which induces a dynamic deformation of the material elements carrying solutes (Le Borgne et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013). This particular spatial organization is shown to have a major impact on global reactivity by increasing the surface available for reactive mixing and by enhancing local chemical gradients (de Anna et al., Geophys. Res. Lett. 2014). We quantify this phenomenon for different flow topologies using a reactive lamella representation, which links fluid deformation, diffusion and reaction at the elementary scale. The upscaled reaction rates, estimated by integrating the distribution of local deformation rates, are shown to follow different temporal behavior depending on the distribution of local velocity gradients. This approach allows for the systematic evaluation of the temporal evolution of upscaled reaction rates, and establishes a direct link between the global reaction efficiency and the spatial characteristics of the underlying pore scale flow field.\n",

            "abstract": "This study employs a variety of geophysical, biological, hydrological, and pedological methods to expand on the understanding of how contrasting aspects, lithologies, and vegetation influence critical zone structure and evolution. We performed shallow seismic refraction (SSR) and time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys across two geologically distinct valleys within the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in southwestern Idaho. We also quantified vegetation density, soil pH, and subsurface stratigraphy (by manual sampling) across opposing north-facing (forested) and south-facing (unforested) aspects to better understand the relationship between lithology, vegetation, seasonal moisture dynamics, and saprolite genesis within the critical zone. The first study sub-site, Upper Johnston Draw, resides on late Cretaceous granitic bedrock associated with the Idaho Batholith. The second study sub-site, Upper Sheep Creek, resides on Miocene basaltic bedrock. In the granitic Upper Johnston Draw there is a sharp contrast in depth to unweathered bedrock (regolith thickness) between the north-facing aspect (average depth of 18.6 m) and the south-facing aspect (average depth of 8.2 m). In the basaltic Upper Sheep Creek there is only a marginal contrast in depth to unweathered bedrock between the north-facing aspect (average depth of 14.4 m) and the south-facing aspect (average depth of 12.0 m). These observed relationships between the contrasting lithologies of Upper Johnston Draw and Upper Sheep Creek, coupled with our time-lapse ERT surveys, vegetation density tests, soil pH tests, and subsurface augering data, provide new understanding about the causes of symmetry or asymmetry in saprolite development on north-facing and south-facing slopes. Specifically, these findings suggest that abiotic chemical weathering via hydrolysis may be the dominant control creating the symmetrical pattern of saprolite genesis (north vs. south aspects) observed within the basalt-parented site. While conversely, within the critical zone of the paired granitic site, ecohydrologically-influenced chemical weathering via oxidation and organic acidification may instead be the dominant control creating the distinct asymmetrical pattern of saprolite genesis observed.",

            "abstract": "Heat transfer between the atmosphere and Earth’s surface represents a key component to understanding Earth energy balance, making it important in understanding and simulating climate. Arguably, the oceanic air-sea interface and Polar sea-ice-air interface are amongst the most challenging in which to measure these fluxes. This difficulty results partially from challenges associated with infrastructure deployment on these surfaces and partially from an inability to obtain spatially representative values over a potentially inhomogeneous surface.\nTraditionally sensible (temperature) and latent (moisture) fluxes are estimated using one of several techniques. A preferred method involves eddy-correlation where cross-correlation between anomalies in vertical motion (w) and temperature (T) or moisture (q) is used to estimate heat transfer. High-frequency measurements of these quantities can be derived using tower-mounted instrumentation. Such systems have historically been deployed over land surfaces or on ships and buoys to calculate fluxes at the air-land or air-sea interface, but such deployments are expensive and challenging to execute, resulting in a lack of spatially diverse measurements. A second (“bulk”) technique involves the observation of horizontal windspeed, temperature and moisture at a given altitude over an extended time period in order to estimate the surface fluxes.\nSmall Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) represent a unique platform from which to derive these fluxes. These sUAS can be small (~1 m), lightweight (~700 g), low cost (~$2000) and relatively easy to deploy to remote locations and over inhomogeneous surfaces. We will give an overview of the ability of sUAS to provide measurements necessary for estimating surface turbulent fluxes. This discussion is based on flights in the vicinity of the 1000 ft. Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) tower, and over the US Department of Energy facility at Oliktok Point, Alaska. We will present initial comparisons between UAS-derived turbulent fluxes and those derived from tower-based instrumentation and discuss differences in the context of sensor technology and flight patterns employed to collect data.",

            "abstract": "The island of Taiwan is currently under construction due to the collision of the northwestern corner of the Philippine Sea plate and the embedded Luzon island arc with the larger continental Eurasian plate. This collision is responsible for the current growth of the Central Range that dominates the eastern half of the island. An international collaboration involving several USA and Taiwan universities and academic institutions was formed to study how the orogen evolves through time and to understand the role of a colliding island arc in mountain building. The project, Taiwan Integrated Geodynamics Research (TAIGER), was funded by NSF-Continental Dynamics and Taiwan National Science Council.\nThe Central Range grows at one of the most rapid rates of uplift in the world, exposing metamorphic rocks that were once at least 10 km deep. The range offers unique opportunities for studies of crustal seismic anisotropy for two major reasons: (1) its geological makeup is conducive for producing crustal seismic anisotropy; that is, the rocks are highly foliated; and (2) a seismological data volume of significant breadth offers extensive coverage of sources and recording stations throughout the region.\nWe carried out a crustal shear wave splitting study by data mining 3300 local earthquakes collected in the TAIGER 2009 sea-land experiment. We used an automated P and S wave arrival time picking method (Ross and Ben-Zion, 2014) applied to over 100,000 event-station pairs. These data were analyzed for shear-wave splitting using the MFAST automated package (Savage et al., 2010), producing 3300 quality shear wave split measurements. The splitting results were then station-averaged. The results show NNE to NE orientation trends that are consistent with regional cleavage strikes. Average crustal shear wave split time is 0.244 sec. These measurements are consistent with rock physics measurements of Central Range slate and metamorphic acoustic velocities. The splits exhibit orientations correlative with and serve as a proxy for the geological regional fabrics. The results also have the potential of offering information about strain at depth. In addition, the presence of significant rock anisotropy could negatively affect conventional seismic analyses that are based on an assumption of isotropic earth media.",

The first of these, iMUSH, is acquiring wideband MT data at 150 sites, as well as active and passive seismic data in SW Washington (including Mounts Saint Helens, Adams and Rainier). iMUSH seeks to determine details of crustal magma transport and storage, and to resolve major tectonic controls on volcanism along the arc. iMUSH may help to settle a debate over the origin of the SW Washington Crustal Conductor (SWCC), which covers ~5000 km2and that has alternately been attributed to accreted Eocene metasediments or to an extensive region of partial melt in the lower crust beneath the three volcanoes.\nThe iMUSH array is continguous with an amphibious ~150 station MT experiment (MOCHA) onshore and offshore of the Washington and Oregon forearc. MOCHA iwill image the crust and upper mantle of the subduction system in 3D, constraining the fluid input to the system from offshore and the distribution of fluids released from the down-going slab, including along the transitional zone where Episodic Tremor and Slip occurs. Our goal is to refine our understanding of the segmentation, structure and fluid distribution along the convergent margin segments, and their relationship to the spatial pattern of ETS.\nIn contrast to the active Cascadia margin, the Mid-Continent Rift (MCR) is the trace of a massive igneous event that nearly split North America 1.1 billion years ago. Initial results from 3D inversion of MT Transportable Array data show less fine-scale heterogeneity in the upper mantle (250 km depth) than is evident in western, tectonic North America, but a division at the base of thick lithosphere, with higher conductivities beneath and immediately south of the Great Lakes, than to the south. From the base of the lithosphere to the Moho, this high conductivity feature narrows, ultimately disappearing in the mid-crust. In the upper crust above this feature, an E-W elongated conductive feature appears that maps to surface expressions of the MCR. The significance of this deep feature, and its relationship to the failed rifting event of the mesoproterozoic era will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Upwelling regions of the world’s oceans are home to some of the most productive fisheries. Yet these coastal areas provide unique challenges for remote sensing from satellite platforms because of both their proximity to land (radar interference) and typically small horizontal scales (< 50km) of upwelling processes.\nComparisons are performed on the gradient of sea surface temperature (SST) fields derived from multiple sources:\n1) the 0.25 degree resolution National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Optimally Interpolated AVHRR+in-situ or AVHRR_OI, data set.\n2) the 1km resolution Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) gridded SST data set,\n3) the 0.25 degree resolution SST derived from the WindSat microwave sensor,\n4) a 2km version of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Model (HECCO2).\nTemporal and spatial correlations between HECCO2 and MUR, as well as between HECCO2 and NCDC, are examined through the dominant singular vectors (eigenmodes) of the covariance matrix for each pair of data sets. In both cases the first mode of covariability accounts for over 90% of the total variance. A simple technique based on SST gradients is then applied to the first mode to determine the upwelling scales based on HECCO2, MUR, and NCDC.\nLongitudinal sections at 8S, 20S, and 30S indicate that the upwelling scale decreases between 8S and 20S. At 20S the first mode of covariability between MUR and HECCO2 indicate an upwelling scale between 25 and 50km. Results are consistent when compared with chlorophyll-a data from MODIS-Aqua. Such upwelling scales are not seen in the WindSat data and reduced in the NCDC data. A reduction of the upwelling scale by a factor 0.2 between 8S and 20S is consistent with a dependence on the Coriolis parameter. A major conclusion of the work is that magnitudes of SST gradient and upwelling scales derived from MUR are consistent with those of the HECCO2 for the test period of October-November 2011. Additionally, it is shown that to resolve upwelling scales near the coast high resolution infrared data must be used in the analysis. Microwave derived SSTs, such as those from WindSat are of limited value when upwelling scales are less then 50km.",

            "abstract": "Orbital gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) experiments with high-resolution high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors have successfully measured elemental abundances in the top ~50 cm of the surfaces of Mars and Mercury. GRS is sensitive to bulk concentrations of H, C, O, S, Fe, and Si among other elements. As these elements are also diagnostic of major carbonaceous and ordinary chondritic meteorite classes, we have simulated the science performance of a HPGe experiment in orbit around asteroids with model compositions corresponding to those of volatile-rich CI and CO carbonaceous chondritic meteorites. A circular orbit around a spherical asteroid was considered, with the altitude of the orbit equal to the radius of the asteroid (similar to the Dawn low-altitude mapping orbit \"LAMO\").\nWe simulated the gamma-ray and neutron emission from CI-like (~17 wt%\nstructural H2O) and CO-like (<2 wt% structural H2O) asteroids using\nthe MCNPX Monte-Carlo radiation transport code. The spacecraft\nbackground (based on a Dawn-like spacecraft model) was also modeled\nusing MCNPX: this included background due to direct GCR/spacecraft\ninteractions and also background due to asteroidal neutron flux on the\nspacecraft.\nThe detector model was based on the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer (\"MOGRS\"; Boynton et al. 2004, 2007), the largest HPGe detector flown to date. The spectra from the MCNPX output were broadened to a resolution based on the in-flight performance of MOGRS, FWHM = 4.1 keV at 1332 keV (Evans et al. 2006). Doppler broadening was also modeled where applicable. Line fluxes were then extracted from the combined background + asteroid spectrum and statistical uncertainties evaluated.\nOur simulations show that asteroids can be identified as having\nCI-like vs. CO-like compositions in H/Si, O/Si, S/Si, and C/Si with\nMOGRS within 4.5 months in a Dawn LAMO-like orbit. In addition, the\nFe/Si and S/Si sensitivity are sufficient to distinguish CO and other\nlow-hydrogen carbonaceous chondritic compositions from achondritic\ncarbon-rich (ureilitic) compositions.",

            "abstract": "Over the past three years, we have developed and implemented a collaborative summer science program for Mashpee Wampanoag youth that engages tribal elders, parents, educators, and local scientists to connect tribal youth with the ecology and geology of their traditional homelands. This collaboration, called Native Youth in Science: Preserving our Homeland (POH), involves the Mashpee Wampanoag Education and Natural Resource Departments, an experienced team of tribal elders and scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, U.S. Forest Service, and NOAA National Marine Fisheries. The team has developed and implemented a curriculum that stresses the ancestral relationships of Wampanoag people to their land. Through hands-on activities at locations of cultural significance, our efforts focus on presenting topics in environmental science from both western science and Wampanoag perspectives to 5th-8th grade students from the Wampanoag Tribe. Overarching themes focus on local land use history and its impact on traditional food sources such as shellfish and herring. Lessons typically address hydrology, water quality, fish and shellfish biology, botany, and local geology. To present these topics, scientists are paired with Wampanoag Tribe culture keepers to develop lessons that present science topics side-by-side with cultural knowledge. The primary goals of POH are to (a) connect and reinforce science concepts learned in conventional school settings for tribal youth; (b) demonstrate the use of science as a tool for understanding and preserving the ecosystems and homelands of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe; and (c) how indigenous traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and western science complement each other. In the long-term, this program begins to prepare tribal students for more advanced programs supporting their pursuit of higher education.",

J. 747, 109, 2012], we have concluded that the Parker model of coronal heating can provide enough heating, independent of Lundquist number, for the quasi-equilibrium case with the coronal loop length L much shorter than VAtc, the distance travelled by Alfven waves during one correlation time of random photospheric motions. We have now generalized our simulations with cases to longer L. We will present most recent results from a series of three-dimensional simulations based on the equations of reduced magnetohydrodynamics for the time-averaged energy dissipation rate <W> as a function of L. In the limit of L >> VAtc, we show that <W> is given by the photospheric Poynting flux required to launch Alfven waves. In the intermediate range of L ~ VAtc, <W> is well described by a scaling based on the Kolmogorov turbulence energy cascade, rather than the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan cascade. For the whole range of L we considered, we will show that <W> can be modeled by combining the Parker heating and the Alfven wave launching power. This work is supported by a NSF grant AGS-0962477.",

            "abstract": "In this work we apply a Bayesian methodology to reconstruct historical SWE estimates over two test watersheds in the semi-arid Andes (33°S). The approach combines climatological reanalysis forcing data, in-situ precipitation, a Land Surface Model (LSM) and a snow depletion model to generate ensembles of prior SWE for each pixel over the watersheds. The precipitation forcing data is then updated by assimilating fractional snow covered area (fSCA) from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites using an Ensemble Kalman Smoother approach, generating new precipitation fields that are then used in a posterior LSM simulation. The resulting (posterior) SWE estimates are validated using in-situ snow depth measurements surveyed during 2009 to 2013. Results show significant improvements in error statistics, including an increase in correlation, a reduction in bias and a reduction in Root Mean Square error. After assimilation the posterior fSCA temporal evolution is consistent with the remotely sensed fSCA data, showing significant differences with the original prior estimates generated in the open-loop model simulation. The framework is robust to negative and positive biases in prior precipitation, resulting in similar posterior metrics regardless of the initial bias level. The resulting SWE fields are analyzed in terms of spatial distribution and relation with physiographic characteristics. A high correlation with slope suggests that gravitational distribution mechanisms play a significant role in snow distribution over these watersheds. Despite the fact that the LSM has no gravitational redistribution algorithm, the assimilation framework was able to capture this source of variability.",

            "abstract": "High-energy ultraviolet (UV-C) radiation is a significant challenge to life in environments such as high altitude areas, the early Earth, the Martian surface, and space. As UV-C exposure is both a selection pressure and a mutagen, adaptation dynamics in such environments include a high rate of change in both tolerance-related and non-tolerance-related genes, as well changes in linkages between the resulting traits. Determining the relationship between the intensity and duration of the UV-C exposure, mutation rate, and emergence of UV-C resistance will inform our understanding of both the emergence of radiation-related extremophily in natural environments and the optimal strategies for generating artificial extremophiles.\nIn this study, we iteratively exposed an Escherichia colistrain to UV-C radiation of two different fluxes, 3.3 J/m^2/s for 6 seconds and 0.5 J/m^2/s for 40 seconds, with the same overall fluence of 20 J/m^2. After each iteration, cells from each exposure regime were assayed for increased UV-C tolerance as an adaptive trait. The exposed cells carried a plasmid bearing a TEM beta-lactamase gene, which in the absence of antibiotic treatment is a neutral reporter for mutagenesis. Sequencing of this gene allowed us to determine the baseline mutation frequency for each flux. As an additional readout for adaptation, the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase mutations was tested by plating UV-exposed cultures in cefotaxime plates.\nWe observed an increase of approximately one-million-fold in UV-C tolerance over seven iterations; no significant difference between the two fluxes was found. Future work will focus on identifying the genomic changes responsible for the change in UV-C tolerance; determining the mechanisms of the emerged UV-C tolerance; and performing competition experiments between the iteration strains to quantify fitness tradeoffs resulting from UV-C adaptation.",

            "abstract": "Many coastal communities worldwide are vulnerable to flooding and erosion driven by extreme total water levels (TWL), potentially dangerous events produced by the combination of large waves, high tides, and high non-tidal residuals. The West coast of the United States provides an especially challenging environment to model these processes due to its complex geological setting combined with uncertain forecasts for sea level rise (SLR), changes in storminess, and possible changes in the frequency of major El Niños. Our research therefore aims to develop an appropriate methodology to assess present-day and future storm-induced coastal hazards along the entire U.S. West coast, filling this information gap. We present the application of this framework in a pilot study at Ocean Beach, California, a National Park site within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area where existing event-scale coastal change data can be used for model calibration and verification. We use a probabilistic, full simulation TWL model (TWL-FSM; Serafin and Ruggiero, in press) that captures the seasonal and interannual climatic variability in extremes using functions of regional climate indices, such as the Multivariate ENSO index (MEI), to represent atmospheric patterns related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\nIn order to characterize the effect of climate variability on TWL components, we refine the TWL-FSM by splitting non-tidal residuals into low (monthly mean sea level anomalies) and high frequency (storm surge) components. We also develop synthetic climate indices using Markov sequences to reproduce the autocorrelated nature of ENSO behavior. With the refined TWL-FSM, we simulate each TWL component, resulting in synthetic TWL records providing robust estimates of extreme return level events (e.g., the 100-yr event) and the ability to examine the relative contribution of each TWL component to these extreme events. Extreme return levels are then used to drive storm impact models to examine the probability of coastal change (Stockdon et al., 2013) and thus, the vulnerability to storm-induced coastal hazards that Ocean Beach faces. Future climate variability is easily incorporated into this framework, allowing us to quantify how an evolving climate will alter future extreme TWLs and their related coastal impacts.",

            "abstract": "As water is the primary resource limitation for cropping systems over the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW), water use efficiency impacts regional water availability, crop yields, and net carbon sequestration. Furthermore, nitrogen (N) use efficiency affects the cost of farming and the total N flux to the environment (including leaching to aquatic ecosystems and greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere). Climate change affects water and nitrogen use efficiencies due to the combined effects of warming (reducing snowpack water storage, increasing ET, earlier leaf-on, shortening or lengthening plant growth season, etc.), the CO2 fertilization effects (increasing net primary productivity and leaf-level water and energy use efficiencies for C3 crops), and extreme climate events (drought and flood). Cropland conservation management (rotation, tillage, irrigation, and fertilization) is widely practiced in this region for maintaining high productivity of agricultural lands. To reduce vulnerability to weather extremes and long-term climate change, management regimes will likely need to be adapted for a changing environment. Here, we applied the coupled macro-scale hydrologic and crop growth model (VIC-CropSyst) to study how climate change in the 21st century will change water and nitrogen use efficiencies over the PNW. Simulation experiments with different combinations of management options and climate scenarios are used for attributing effects of climate factors and management options on long-term trends and fluctuations on water and nitrogen use efficiency. Preliminary simulation results indicate that there is a trend of decreasing water and nitrogen use efficiency over the inner PNW domain during the 21th century because of increasing ET, a seasonal shift in water availability, and the intensification of extreme climate events. Effective managements, including no-tillage and conservational tillage and optimized irrigation can eliminate the decrease or even increase water and nitrogen use efficiencies over certain areas but the overall effects are location- and crop-specific. The social and economic consequences of these adaptation and mitigation costs must be assessed before using this information to inform large-scale practices.",

These regional NW-SE striking sets include large seismogenic sources that caused major historical earthquakes (Mw≤7). The faults in the northern part of the study area dip to the southwest; those in the southern part dip to the northeast. The SW-dipping system (Abruzzi Apennines) terminates with the Aremogna-Cinque Miglia source; the NE-dipping system (southern Apennines) terminates with the Boiano Basin source.\nTo test whether the transfer zone model applies to the central-southern Apennines border, we analyzed and relocated seismicity that occurred from 2007 to 2011 between the Aremogna-Cinque Miglia and Boiano Basin sources, where we expect the transfer zone. Seismicity is made of independent events (Md<3.5) and low-magnitude swarms. West of the Apennines, hypocenters are located within the uppermost 12-13 km. Events and swarms that occurred east of the axis affect prevalently the 13-20 km below. West of the chain, focal mechanisms show T-axes striking ~NNW-SSE. East of the chain, T-axes strike ~NE-SW. This trend is consistent with the large scale stress field acting in the Apennine Chain, as suggested by GPS data. The hypocentral distribution of swarms located between the Aremogna-Cinque Miglia and Boiano Basin sources shows a ~NNE-SSW trend, coincident with part of the Ortona-Roccamonfina Line, a regional transverse lineament.\nThe spatial distribution of seismicity, the geometry and kinematics of active faulting in the region, and results from previous geophysical studies, allow us to contend the existence of a transfer zone between these seismogenic normal fault systems. Our data also allow us to recognize the activity of such transfer along the central part of the Ortona-Roccamonfina Line. We infer that reverse in dip polarity between the two normal fault systems could also result from the passage between the diverse tectonic units composing the border between central and southern Apennines.",

The sand’s origin investigation could be useful to fight against erosion and silting problems from the source of supply, to this end, mineralogical analysis was carried out in Khnifiss beach’s sand using Optic Microscope and Scanning Electronic Microscope with dispersive energy (SEM- EDS), in addition to physico-chemical analysis provided by Electronic Microprobe. The results revealed: (i) a high grade of oxides (Rutile, Ilmenite, Magnetite, Ulvöspinel) in samples, (ii) silicates (Quartz, Clinopyroxene, feldspar, Zircon), (iii) phosphate (apatite) and (iv) carbonate (calcite). The dominance of iron oxides justifies the black sand’s colour. Then, the mineral composition supposes interference between different origins: proximal source (Calcareous cliff) for calcite, distal sources of oxides and silicates are supposed to be eroded and carried by Drâa valley from granite and igneous rocks in Anti-Atlasic field. Another source supposed might be a proximal volcanic island (Canaries island).",

            "abstract": "Environmental and climate changes are important elements of our global challenges. They are observed at a global scale and in particular in the Arctic. In order to give better estimates of the future changes, the Arctic has to be monitored and analyzed by a multi-disciplinary observation system that will improve Earth System Models. The best chance to achieve significant results within a relatively short time frame is found in regions with a large natural climate gradient, and where processes sensitive to the expected changes are particularly important. Svalbard and the surrounding ocean areas fulfil all these criteria. The vision for SIOS is to be a regional observational system for long term acquisition and proliferation of fundamental knowledge on global environmental change within an Earth System Science perspective in and around Svalbard. SIOS will systematically develop and implement methods for how observational networks are to be construed. The distributed SIOS data management system (SDMS) will be implemented through a combination of technologies tailored to the multi-disciplinary nature of the Arctic data. One of these technologies is The Brokering approach or “Framework”. The Brokering approach provides a series of services such as discovery, access, transformation and semantics support to enable translation from one discipline/culture to another. This is exactly the challenges the SDMS will have to handle and thus the Brokering approach is integrated in the design of the system. A description of the design strategy for the SDMS that includes The Brokering approach will be presented. The design and implementation plans for the SDMS are based on research done in the EU funded ESFRI project SIOS and examples of solutions for interoperable systems producing Arctic datasets and products coordinated through SIOS will be showcased. The reported experience from SIOS brokering approach will feed into the process of developing a sustainable brokering governance in the framework of Research Data Alliance. It will also support the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). This is a contribution to increase our global capacity to create interoperable systems that provide multi-disciplinary dataset and products.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the United States have been largely inconsistent, particularly for oil and gas production (OGP) in the South-Central United States. We have quantified the contribution of OGP to the South-Central US (TX/OK/KS) CH4 budget through atmospheric regional transport modeling with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ). This model is driven by a new process-based, spatially resolved OGP CH4 emissions inventory. We employed Bayesian inference to calibrate CMAQ emissions inputs using continuous CH4 measurements at the DOE Southern Great Plains (SGP) central facility and evaluated model predictions against a subset of aircraft and surface flask measurements that are assimilated by NOAA’s CarbonTracker-CH4. Our results suggest that OGP emissions are the largest source of CH4 observed at the DOE SGP site and the largest source of CH4 in TX/OK/KS, constituting ~45% of total CH4 emission in the region. The next largest source in the region is livestock, with other sources being relatively less important. We estimate OGP emissions in TX/OK/KS contribute about one half of national total OGP emissions. Using continuous CH4 measurements, we found evidence of rapid nocturnal transport by the Great Plains low-level jet (LLJ) and sporadic oil and gas emissions. Our study demonstrates the importance of improved knowledge of the spatial and temporal features of oil and gas emissions in reconciling CH4 budgets derived using bottom-up and top-down approaches at regional and national scales.",

            "abstract": "Fluorine and chlorine are commonly considered together with hydrogen, carbon, and sulfur as volatile elements in volcanic system because molecular species of these elements are found in volcanic gasses. However, fluorine and chlorine do not correlate with H2O and CO2among degassed volcanic glasses, suggesting these halogens are inefficiently degassed, and fractionated during magma ascent. Because Cl is highly soluble in aqueous fluid, and F commonly substitutes in the OH site of hydroxyl-bearing minerals (such as amphiboles, micas, humites, and apatite), they can be ideal geochemical tracers recording fractionation due to aqueous fluid, melt, and/or supercritical fluid in the mantle.\nIn this contribution, we summarize recent experimental results, natural observations, and illustrate prospect of these light halogen as geochemical tracers. Notably, recent partitioning experiments report complex behavior of F. For example, F is incompatible in anhydrous mantle minerals (olivine, pyroxene, and garnet) against aqueous fluid and silicate melts, while F can be compatible in amphibole, and mica against aqueous fluid and/or silicate melt. Furthermore, some studies indicate that F fractionation between liquid and solid is strongly influenced by the nature of the liquid. For all conditions mentioned here, Cl is systematically more incompatible than F. These data provide powerful bases to interpret geochemical correlations found in least degassed basaltic glasses, mainly from olivine-hosted inclusions, of arc, MORB and OIB. In some cases we have a strong indication showing amphibole-aqueous fluid fractionation beneath arc. Lastly, F measurements in oceanic crust and Alpine ophiolites suggest lithology-P-T dependent intake/release of these elements, adding a layer of complexity to global halogen cycles.",

            "abstract": "The impact bombardment periods that likely affected ancient (Noachian and pre-Noachian) Mars are (i) the post-accretionary elevated impactor flux, commonly known as the \"heavy bombardment\" and (ii) a putative increase in the number of impact events around 4.0 Ga, commonly known as the \"late heavy bombardment\" (LHB). These events would have affected the biological potential of Mars by melting and fracturing the crust, depositing large amounts of impact ejecta, generating hydrothermal systems, delivering elements essential for life, and likely increasing the temperature of the Martian atmosphere.\nWe model two types of post-accretionary bombardments: (i) a classical exponential decay and (ii) a sawtooth timeline, characterized by faster-than-exponential decay and reduced total mass. Likewise, two types of LHB are modeled: (i) a classic \"spike,\" centered at 3.9 Ga and lasting ~100 Myr, and (ii) a \"sawtooth\" LHB, characterized by a sudden increase in the number of impacts at ~4.1 Ga, overall lower delivered mass, and a longer duration.\nPartial results of these simulations are summarized in Table 1. To estimate habitable volumes in hydrothermal environments, surface temperatures of 1 °C and -63 °C were tested. Even in the latter case, life may have persevered in a global aquifer underneath a layer of permafrost termed the cryosphere. Over 105-106of the impact craters that formed during the LHB and post-accretionary bombardment, respectively, would have accessed this global aquifer via cryospheric melt-through, resulting in a subsurface plumbing network between individual impact-induced hydrothermal systems.\nTable 1.

If the object is known to be competent, the kinetic impactor is shown to be highly efficient. The momentum delivered to the object can be much greater than the momentum of the impactor because of the reaction force produced by ablation from the impact crater. We use an adaptive-mesh hydrocode to study the momentum-enhancement factor, or beta, varying the assumptions regarding the equation of state and the strength of the target. Spall from the back side of the asteroid, which partly counters the favorable effect of ablation, is also included in the calculations. For objects not known to be competent, the nuclear stand-off burst option may be preferable. In this case, crucial questions surround the optimum height of burst and the radiation characteristics of the burst. The same hydrocode, with radiation diffusion included, is used to study this case as well. Figures of merit from both these studies include the bulk momentum imparted to the asteroid and the degree to which the asteroid is disrupted.\nLA-UR-14-26234",

            "abstract": "To understand the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the NY coast, we conducted subsurface and multi-beam analyses, ground-truthed by grab samples, in 3 areas: the western end of Fire Island (FIW), eastern Fire Island (FIE) where a new inlet formed during the storm, and Long Beach (LB). Grab samples yielded sands and muds, a surprise given the shallow (10-25m) water depths. Muds rested on top of sands and were removed for additional analyses. Since percent mud could not be determined absolutely, sediments were washed through a 63 mm sieve, RoTapped for 10 minutes at ¼ Φ, and weight percent calculated for the coarse fraction.\nAt FIW and FIE, fine sands dominate the shallowest depths studied, consistent with previous studies. At FIE, the sedimentary wedge extends to ~15m, with finest sands (peak 3-3.5 Φ) in shallowest waters surveyed (~10m). Slightly coarser (2.5Φ) sediments plus relict gravels are present in swales where the wedge shoals. This supports mapping results indicating sand ridges migrated to the SW. Medium to fine sand is present at the deepest extent of the wedge; the grain size distribution matches a sample taken in the swash zone on the eastern flank of the new breach. Sediments may have been transported shoreward and then reworked post-Sandy. Samples seaward of the new breach were capped by a mud layer, which in turn had a layer of fine sand resting on it, evidence of a nascent ebb tidal deposit. At FIW, sediments in the shallow NE swale are finer (3.5Φ) and better sorted. As the region is underlain by relict sediments, these fine sands may be relicts exposed by storm-driven bedform migration. Deeper water (~22m w.d.) samples at FIW are coarser and contain shell hash. Sand on the lee side of the sand ridge, which CHIRP profiles show did not migrate significantly and accumulated sands, are medium (1.5 Φ), and match the grain sizes found on Fire Island beach. Muds contain heavy metals in concentrations consistent with transport from adjacent estuaries.",

The Crop Assessment Tool allows users to view satellite derived products, best available crop masks, and crop calendars (created in collaboration with GEOGLAM Crop Monitor partners), then in turn submit crop assessment entries detailing the crop’s condition, drivers, impacts, trends, and other information.\nAlthough the Crop Assessment Tool was originally intended to collect data on major crop production at the global scale, the types of data collected are also relevant to the food security and rangelands monitoring communities. In line with the GEOGLAM Countries at Risk philosophy of “foster[ing] the coordination of product delivery and capacity building efforts for national and regional organizations, and the development of harmonized methods and tools”, a modified version of the Crop Assessment Tool is being developed for the USAID Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).\nAs a member of the Countries at Risk component of GEOGLAM, FEWS NET provides agricultural monitoring, timely food security assessments, and early warnings of potential significant food shortages focusing specifically on countries at risk of food security emergencies. While the FEWS NET adaptation of the Crop Assessment Tool focuses on crop production in the context of food security rather than large scale production, the data collected is nearly identical to the data collected by the Crop Monitor.

            "abstract": "This contribution provides a new approach to calculate the plagioclase composition of a given igneous rock based on kinetics parameters of crystallization obtained from CSD analyses of plagioclase. The procedure we use includes the following steps: 1) determination of the effective rates of crystal growth and nucleation based on the maximum time interval of mineral crystallization obtained from the CSD segment with the minimum slope and extrapolated to rest of the segments; 2) calculation of the total crystallization time; 3) determination of the time-dependent variation of plagioclase volume fraction based on crystal population density and CSD slopes; 4) calculation of the ideal rates of crystal growth and nucleation; 5) determination of temperature of plagioclase crystallization as a function of the ideal crystal growth rate; 6) determination of plagioclase composition as a function of the ideal crystal growth rate.\nWe apply our model for plagioclase of 17 samples of The Villarrica Volcano 1971 eruption lava flow. All CSD show two segments with a break at 0.3 mm. The first segment is interpreted as the syn-eruptive crystallization and the second as the within-reservoir crystallization. An interval of 1.5 years as a maximum crystallization time for the syn-eruptive stage was estimated from Cashman’s (1993) expression. Crystal growth rates in the reservoir stage took place during two stages. The first stage varies from 10^-8.9 to 10^-9.4 mm s-1 and the second one varied from 10^-9.4 to 10^-9.1 mm s-1. Finally, the crystal growth rate as high as 10^-7.8 mm s-1 were estimated for the syn-eruptive stage. Nucleation rates varies exponentially from 10^-13 to 10^-8 s-1 in the reservoir stage and from 10^-8 to 10^-1 s^-1 in the syn-eruptive stage. The total crystallization interval varies from 120 to 390 years. A mean total volume fraction of plagioclase of 0.55 was obtained (0.98 for all minerals) whereas a mean value of 0.054 was obtained at the onset of the eruption (0.096 for all minerals). An empirical relation between the crystal growth rate and the XAn was obtained for plagioclases of the studied eruption. Thus, a variation of 232° C for the whole plagioclase crystallization history was obtained.",

            "abstract": "Climate regionalization is an important but often under-emphasized step in studies of climate variability and predictions. While most investigations of regional climate or statistical/dynamical predictions do make at least an implicit attempt to focus on a study region or sub-regions that are climatically coherent in some respect, rigorous climate regionalization––in which the study area is divided on the basis of the most relevant climate metrics and at a resolution most appropriate to the data and the scientific question––has the potential to enhance the precision and explanatory power of climate studies in many cases. This is particularly true for climatically complex regions such as the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) and Equatorial West Africa. Here we present an improved clustering method and a flexible, open-source software tool (R package “HiClimR”) designed specifically for climate regionalization. As a demonstration, we apply HiClimR to regionalize the GHA on the basis of interannual precipitation variability in each calendar month and for three-month running seasons. Different clustering methods are tested to show the behavior of each method and provide recommendations for specific problems. This would underscore the applicability of our work to a wide range of climate issues, and enable researchers to easily and quickly learn how to apply our tools to their own problems. Both the proposed methodology and the R package can be easily used for a broad range of climate applications.",

            "abstract": "Graduate and undergraduate students with an interest in science education complete an intensive three-week “Maymester” course at Mississippi State University that includes one week of field experience teaching science in outdoor environments. The focus of the course includes the history and rationales for interdisciplinary outdoor education and informal learning environments while promoting successful pedagogical practices to enhance science instruction. Students gain valuable outdoor education field experience through a week of full emersion at a residential environmental learning center at the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, TN (\nwww.gsmit.org\n) that challenges perceptions of what many believe are “good teaching” practices. Tremont offers multiple overnight educational options for K-12 schools, teacher professional development programs, master naturalists trainings, and citizen science opportunities to the public. Being fully immersed in the outdoors teaching and learning about Earth Science interdisciplinary topics creates a paradigm shift in what is considered to be effective teaching by the graduate and undergraduate participants. Prior to the week at Tremont, students select a Tremont created outdoor educational activity to teach their fellow the graduate and undergraduate students while at Tremont. All activities promote inquiry and hands-on exploration utilizing authentic science process skills in outdoor field research settings that can also be adapted for local school environments. At Tremont the students reside in platform tents located at the center to allow complete immersion in the culture of informal learning unique to outdoor education. In addition to gaining personal experiences leading outdoor science activities, the college students get to actively observe experts in the field of outdoor ecological education model exemplary pedagogical practices of guided inquiry and effective questioning strategies. The impact of the full emersion field experience gained by class participants will be one that they can implement into a variety of science education settings to enrich understanding of the Geosciences to diverse audiences.",

            "abstract": "Recent measurements of ocean bottom pressure suggest that hydrothermal flow induces cm-scale periodic ground surface displacement (GSD) at the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sohn et al., 2009). The pressure measurements contain spectral peaks and harmonics with periods ranging from 22 to 53 min, none of which can be attributed to oceanographic or Earth tide processes. It is hypothesized that GSD cycles in this system may result from a nonlinear feedback between pore pressure and permeability in the hydrothermal system.\nTo test this hypothesis we have developed a poroelastic convection model representing the upper crustal section at TAG that includes a \"switching\" type pressure-permeability feedback in the stockwork zone of the hydrothermal system. In this zone, the permeability increases when the pressure reaches a critical high value, and decreases when it reaches a critical low value. This behavior simulates the opening and closing of cracks within the hydrothermal system, and is similar to mechanisms that have been proposed for dike propagation in magmatic systems (Buck et al., 2006).\nOur modeling suggests that this mechanism can generate GSD that are similar to those observed at TAG. We are currently using these models to explore the sensitivity of inflation and deflation rates to system properties such as the geometry of the stockwork zone, the temperature of fluid in the upflow zone, the elastic properties of the lithosphere, and the relationship between pore pressure and permeability.",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS) formed by magma-poor rifting in the Paleogene. The Qiongdongnan basin (QDNB) located at the north margin was thought to completely lack magma activities. Due to the limited amount of deepwater drills, magmas in deepwater area had been ignored in petroleum exploration, and thus our knowledge of basin analysis is far from complete.\nBased on a comprehensive study on seismic profiles and P wave velocity data, 12 intrusion-related seismic reflection anomalies in QDNB have been recognized. In the southwest of QDNB, gas chimneys and gas clouds have been found with a low velocity (<3.4 km/s). In the center area, the intensively deformed strata passing towards the diapir flanks suggest the existence of magma diapirs. However, the velocity within diapirs is neither too high nor too low (3.7–4.6 km/s), and there has been no obvious magnetic anomaly or gravity anomaly be found. Previous researches prove that the temperatures of the crustal melt layers at the time that the basalt solidifies are high (900–950 °C) so that the process can produce magmas representing large degrees of partial fusion of the crust. To judge from the evidence, in the center area these could be mixed magmas. Further east, the diapirs possess typical features of basaltic magma intrusions with a high seismic velocity (>6 km/s), a positive magnetic anomaly and a high gravity anomaly. In addition, according to different dips of marginal facies, three phases of diapirism can be identified (32 Ma, 15.5 Ma and 10.5 Ma). Along a narrow area with hyper-extended crust, those intrusions document the opening of SCS at 32 Ma and the volcanic activities afterwards.\nThe results are corresponding to the fact that all of the intrusions in QDNB occurred during the extreme crustal thinning process and after the cessation of seafloor spreading, and thus the intrusion evolved with time would have major implications for post-rift emplacement.",

            "abstract": "This presentation discusses a new method to assess vulnerability and resilience strategies for stakeholders of coastal-dependent transportation infrastructure, such as seaports. Much coastal infrastructure faces increasing risk to extreme events resulting from sea level rise and tropical storms. As seen after Hurricane Sandy, natural disasters result in economic costs, damages to the environment, and negative consequences on resident’s quality of life. In the coming decades, tough decisions will need to be made about investment measures to protect critical infrastructure. Coastal communities will need to weigh the costs and benefits of a new storm barrier, for example, against those of retrofitting, elevating or simply doing nothing. These decisions require understanding the priorities and concerns of stakeholders. For ports, these include shippers, insurers, tenants, and ultimate consumers of the port cargo on a local and global scale, all of whom have a stake in addressing port vulnerabilities.Decision-makers in exposed coastal areas need tools to understand stakeholders concerns and perceptions of potential resilience strategies. For ports, they need answers to: 1) How will stakeholders be affected? 2) What strategies could be implemented to build resilience? 3) How effectively would the strategies mitigate stakeholder concerns? 4) What level of time and investment would strategies require? 5) Which stakeholders could/should take responsibility? Our stakeholder-based method provides answers to questions 1-3 and forms the basis for further work to address 4 and 5.\nTogether with an expert group, we developed a pilot study for stakeholders of Rhode Island's critical energy port, the Port of Providence. Our method uses a plausible extreme storm scenario with localized visualizations and a portfolio of potential resilience strategies. We tailor a multi-criteria decision analysis tool and, through a series of workshops, we use the storm scenario, resilience strategies, and decision tool to elicit perceptions and priorities of port stakeholders. Results provide new knowledge to assist decision-makers allocate investments of time, money, and staff resources. We intend for our method to be utilized in other port communities around Rhode Island and in other coastal states.",

            "abstract": "Partition coefficients (Kd) are critical in quantitative models of magmatic evolution. High-SiO2 rhyolites (HSR) are characterized by saturation in numerous phases, thus requiring a comprehensive Kd dataset, including both major and accessory minerals. While a large body of published Kd exists, most studies are limited to small suites of elements (e.g. REE) in few (2-3) minerals, using various methods, bulk compositions, and conditions. We use SEM-EDS and LA-ICP-MS analysis to determine crystal rim and unaltered glass compositions in a single sample of Peach Spring Tuff HSR, which reflect equilibration between crystals and melt at or near the time of eruption. We present Kd for 45 elements in 8 minerals: sanidine, plagioclase, biotite, amphibole, titanite, apatite, zircon, and chevkinite.\nWe show that titanite strongly partitions REE from melt, with significant preference for middle (MREE) over light (LREE) and heavy (HREE) REE. Apatite and amphibole share a similar MREE-enriched pattern but with absolute Kd up to ~2 orders of magnitude lower than titanite; while apatite displays a slight preference for LREE over HREE, amphibole shows a higher affinity for HREE than LREE. Zircon strongly partitions HREE, Hf, and U, with little affinity for LREE. Chevkinite concentrates LREE and Th significantly more than any other phase. Biotite Kd are generally <10, the highest being for transition metals and Ba. Both feldspars show strong preference for Sr, Ba, and Eu.\nWe find that our dataset is largely consistent with published studies that use similar (in-situ) techniques and compositions (HSR). We observe a large variation in other studies that we partly attribute to contamination from inclusions, particularly for compositions measured by whole-crystal methods. Our Kd suggest that accessory minerals play a dominant role in partitioning trace elements, and in particular they collectively control the distribution of REE and high field strength elements. Large ion lithophile elements (LILE), in contrast, are most dominantly influenced by feldspars, but if abundant, phases such as biotite and apatite may also influence LILE partitioning.",

            "abstract": "Seismic-reflection imaging has long been a mainstay in the oil and gas exploration community with mind boggling advancements in just the last decade, but its application to engineering, environmental, and groundwater problems has not seen the same level of utilization. A great deal of the problem lies in the many assumptions that are valid for deep exploration that are violated in the very complex near surface. Large channel systems with acquisition geometries conducive for both deep and shallow targets are many times assumed to be capable of extending the imaging depth window. In reality, constraints of the source and sensor/recording systems must be considered, where large powerful sources are needed to image exploration depths while low-energy, high-frequency sources are required for the shallow and thin targets in the near surface. Attempts to make one size fit all will result in artifacts that result in bogus images and characterizations in the shallow subsurface.\n\nNarrow optimum offsets, highly attenuative materials, extreme velocity variability, wavefield interference, and low signal-to-noise ratios provide an ideal breeding ground for the generation of artifacts on near-surface seismic-reflection data. With the cost of shallow reflection data being so high relative to other geophysical methods and invasive sampling, sometimes a single failure can hinder the growth in the use of the method. The method is extremely powerful and has the potential to provide vast quantities of information critical to understand the distributed hydrogeological and biogeochemical processes that elude borehole investigations. It is imperative that data be acquired in its rawest possible form and be processed with an eye to each operation. Cost savings sometimes result in one-size-fits-all acquisition and automated processing flows. Attention to detail and following signal from origination to characterization is essential.\n ",

Tree growth may be limited if the mobility of trace metals found within forest soils is increased to nearly toxic levels due to soil acidification. The iron production boom in central Pennsylvania, which lasted roughly from 1850-1910, would have altered soil compositions of surrounding forests due to large amounts of coal and biomass fuel pollution depositions. The regional collapse of the iron industry by 1910 allows a unique opportunity to observe recovery rates of the surrounding forests and their associated soils over the last century. The pollution history of iron production and rate of soil recovery at this site was determined using tree-ring width measurements and dendrochemical analysis. Six prominent tree species were analyzed for cation and trace metal concentrations retained in the woody structure. Current soil cation and trace-metal concentrations were compared to recent tree-ring chemical compositions. The persistence of soil acidification was determined by observing the changes in major cation concentrations retained in the woody structure over time. This altered soil pH would have mobilized certain trace metals either deposited by the iron production pollution or found naturally in the soil. The effects of soil acidification in the local region are evident in the changes in trace metal concentrations due to increased bioavailability and decreased soil pH. The combined analysis of trace metals and major soil cations yields a specific pollution history and evidence of forest recovery rates from the iron production emissions in central Pennsylvania.",

In the same period, the number of local residents only increased 20% (1088 to1362) but the visitors did in 50% from ca. 200,000 to ca. 300,000. In this coastal zone, the phreatic acts as a storage of nutrients and pollutants from sources related to human activity, thus having a chronic run-off towards the reef, with acute episodes during the rainy season, specially during the anomalous rainy season of 2013. Using videotransects for monitoring the benthic reef components, changes were detected: from 2000 to 2013 the algae cover increased 166%, the reef condition and the reef structure indexes decreased in 50%, and coral diseases incidence increased 25% after a spike increment of 150% in 2010. The role of anthropogenic-stress indicators (population, modified land area, nutrients) was explored along reef condition indicators (reef structure and diversity indexes, topographic complexity, benthic cover and coral diseases incidence) via spatial analysis and multivariate statistics. Spatial patterns of the change in reef condition derived from high-resolution satellite imagery also provided insight for the stressors analysis and their relationships along the study period. Stress indicators (land-modified area and population) are correlated to decreases in coral cover and in reef structure. Direct stressors as sedimentation, nutrients and pollutants seem to be related to the decrease in overall reef condition, although time-series data is lacking; the contextual interpretation of their effects, paired with benthic condition characteristics suggest a strong relationship between these stressors and the decrease in the condition of the reef.",

            "abstract": "Although most freshwater resources are used in agriculture, a greater amount of energy is consumed per unit of water supply for urban areas. Therefore, efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of water in cities, including the energy embedded within household uses, can be an order of magnitude larger than for other water uses. This characteristic of urban water systems creates a promising opportunity to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, particularly given rapidly growing urbanization worldwide.\nBased on a previous Water-Energy-CO2 emissions model for household water end uses, this research introduces a probabilistic two-stage optimization model considering technical and behavioral decision variables to obtain the most economical strategies to minimize household water and water-related energy bills given both water and energy price shocks. Results show that adoption rates to reduce energy intensive appliances increase significantly, resulting in an overall 20% growth in indoor water conservation if household dwellers include the energy cost of their water use.\nTo analyze the consequences on a utility-scale, we develop an hourly water-energy model based on data from East Bay Municipal Utility District in California, including the residential consumption, obtaining that water end uses accounts for roughly 90% of total water-related energy, but the 10% that is managed by the utility is worth over $12 million annually.\nOnce the entire end-use + utility model is completed, several demand-side management conservation strategies were simulated for the city of San Ramon. In this smaller water district, roughly 5% of total EBMUD water use, we found that the optimal household strategies can reduce total GHG emissions by 4% and utility’s energy cost over $70,000/yr. Especially interesting from the utility perspective could be the “smoothing” of water use peaks by avoiding daytime irrigation that among other benefits might reduce utility energy costs by 0.5% according to our assessment.",

            "abstract": "Today, the CALIOP lidar and CloudSat radar have collected more than seven years of observations, and will\nhopefully still operate in 2016, after the EarthCARE-ATLID/CPR launch. Lidars and Radars in space provide\ncutting edge information on the detailed vertical structure of clouds: a key element for both the evaluation of\nthe description of clouds in climate models, and the survey of the clouds inter-annual evolution in various\nclimatic conditions (El Nino, variation of North Atlantic Oscillations, polar regions, etc). For this purpose,\nthe observations collected by CALIOP and by ATLID as well as CloudSat and EarthCARE CPR need to be\nmerged into a long-term (15 years) cloud climatology.\nHere, we examine the possibility of building such a climatology, with the aim of defining its accuracy and\nrelevance for cloud inter-annual studies. We examine the differences between the instruments (wavelengths,\nsatellite’s altitudes, telescope fields of view, multiple scattering processes, spatial resolutions) and their\nability to detect the same clouds consistently. Then, we define a set of cloud detection thresholds for ATLID,\nCALIOP, CloudSat and EarthCARE-CPR and test against synthetic cloud scenes (cirrus and shallow\ncumulus) over small areas (about 200km) produced by a lidar and radar instrument simulator (ECSIM)\nrunning on Large Eddy Simulations. Doing so, we verify that the fourth instruments will be able to detect the\nsame clouds despite their differences (e.g. their sensitivities to noise). Finally, we use the COSP lidar and\nradar simulator to predict the global scale cloud cover that ATLID, CALIOP, CloudSat and EarthCARE CPR\nwould observe if they were overflying the same atmosphere predicted by a GCM. Our results suggest that a\nmerged CALIOP/ATLID and CloudSat/CPR cloud climatology could be to be useful for clouds inter-annual\nstudies, if the post-launch sensitivity of EarthCARE instruments is in line with what is predicted today.",

            "abstract": "The expansion and development of human infrastructure along the coastline of the Pacific Northwest has profound consequences for the habitability and general ecological health of coastal ecosystems. Coos County, one of the most economically critical regions of the Oregon Coast, experienced vigorous timber harvest activity in the aftermath of WWII that declined in the last several decades. This period of extractive land use may have drastically altered the sediment supply in the major catchments of the Coos and Millicoma Rivers and lead to variations in sediment flux into the Coos Bay estuary. Accurate sediment flux histories are critical data for deciphering the relative importance of climate and land use factors such as logging and road construction on sediment production. Reduction of root reinforcement following timber harvest increases the likelihood of shallow landsliding and debris flows. In addition, forest roads increase sediment production due to overland flow and entrainment of fine sediments on hydrologically connected roads. Although these processes have been documented in small watersheds, their compounded effect on estuaries and coastal settings has not been well documented. We use Pb-210 activities derived from sediment cores taken at various locations in the Coos Bay estuary to establish temporal variations in sediment accumulation rates (SARs). Our cores will also be analyzed to assess dissolved oxygen and other proxies for ecosystem functioning. By correlating these SARs with quantitative metrics for timber extraction rate such as board feet per year and qualitative evaluations from historical photos, we propose to document the cumulative effect of historic forest practices. The temporal resolution provided by this technique should allow us to link changes in estuarine sedimentation to changes in land use as well as climatic triggers such as storms. The conclusions of this study will add valuable information regarding the ultimate impact of industry on coastal habitats.",

            "abstract": "Ancient volcanic deposits on terrestrial planetary bodies preserve the earliest record of planetary evolution, revealing important information about both the interior evolution and the surface modification history of planetary bodies. On the Moon, ancient volcanic deposits are referred to as cryptomaria and are basalt deposits that have been obscured by impact basin ejecta. As a result, cryptomaria appear as smooth high-albedo plains. This physical appearance can easily be confused with other formations such as the Cayley Plains, hypothesized to have formed from the ponding of impact basin ejecta into topographic lows.\nThe difficulty in differentiating between cryptomaria and the Cayley Plains has led to the development of several recognition criteria. A high concentration of dark-halo impact craters (DHCs), a mafic enhancement in regolith, and an intermediate albedo are all different criteria used to positively identify cryptomaria. DHCs are small impact craters <10 km in diameter that excavate low-albedo basaltic material from beneath high-albedo surface materials. In this study we used multiple lunar datasets (M3, LOLA, LROC, Diviner) to map the distribution of cryptomaria and to determine the mineralogy of the identified cryptomare deposits.\nOf the 27 regions analyzed, 20 cryptomaria were positively identified. All identified cryptomaria cluster on the nearside, within large impact basins and along the periphery of younger mare basalts. The largest cryptomaria are confined to the interior of ancient impact basins (e.g., Schiller-Zucchius). Including cryptomaria, the total surface area of the Moon covered by mare basalts has increased by ~2%. After identification, M3 spectra collected from DHCs were modeled using the Modified Gaussian Model and indicate that the cryptomaria are basalts and have the same mineralogy as exposed maria in the same study region. Crater counts conducted on the largest cryptomaria produce minimum model age estimates between 3.8 and 4.0 Ga. This, combined with the close association between cryptomaria and exposed maria, suggests that the dated cryptomaria formed just prior to this period of time and imply that the process controlling the distribution of mare basalts was in place near this time in lunar history.",

            "abstract": "Saline fluids with moderate concentrations have been sampled and reported in the Armorican basement at the regional scale (northwestern France). The horizontal and vertical distributions of high chloride concentrations (60-1400mg/L) at the regional scale support the marine origin and provide constraints on the age of these saline fluids. The current distribution of fresh and “saline” groundwater at depth is the result mostly of processes occurring at geological timescales - seawater intrusion processes followed by fresh groundwater flushing -, and only slightly of recent anthropogenic activities. In this study, we focus on seawater intrusion mechanisms in continental aquifers. We argue that one of the most efficient processes in macrotidal environments is the gravity-driven downconing instability below coastal salinized rivers. 2‑D numerical experiments have been used to quantify this process according to four main parameter types: (1) the groundwater system permeability, (2) the salinity degree of the river, (3) the river width and slope, and (4) the tidal amplitude. A general expression of the salinity inflow rates have been derived, which has been used to estimate groundwater salinization rates in Brittany, given the geomorphological and environmental characteristics (drainage basin area, river widths and slopes, tidal range, aquifer permeability). We found that downconing below coastal rivers entail very high saline rates, indicating that this process play a major role in the salinization of regional aquifers. This is also likely to be an issue in the context of climate change, where sea-level rise is expected.",

            "abstract": "The Magallanes–Austral Basin (MAB) is preserved along a >1000 kilometer north–south trending outcrop belt in the southern Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile. The stratigraphic evolution of the MAB has been well documented in the Chilean sector of the basin, however its along-strike counterpart in Argentina is poorly constrained. We present new stratigraphic and geochronologic data from the early basin fill (Aptian–Turonian) from the Argentine sector (49–51°S) of the MAB to document spatial variability in stratigraphic facies and timing of deposition. The initiation of the MAB is marked by the transition from mudstone to coarse-clastic deposition which is characterized by the consistent presence of thick sandstone beds. These sandy facies are interpreted to represent turbidity current deposits in a submarine fan system. This study documents that such facies are present as far north as El Chalten, Argentina (49°S), indicating that facies-equivalent rocks can be traced along-strike for at least 5 degrees of latitude, based on correlation with strata as far south as the Cordillera Darwin (54°S). Detrital zircon U-Pb ages (477 grains from 6 samples) from sandstone within the Argentine sector reveal similar trends to those documented in the Chilean sector. Age populations primarily consist of Aptian–Campanian (126–75 Ma) arc-related grains as well as Cambrian–Triassic ages (600–200 Ma) derived from the East Andean Metamorphic Complex. Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous ages (200–126) representing rift-phase volcanism and early arc magmatism, typically account for less than 5% of the ages. Finally, 6 new U-Pb ages from ash beds, coupled with maximum depositional ages from detrital zircon populations, reveal a southward younging trend in depositional ages. Interpreted ages range from 115 Ma to 95 Ma in the northern sector, but based on previous studies, are not older than 92 Ma and 89 Ma in the central and southern sectors, respectively. The diachronous delivery of coarse detritus into the basin may reflect orogen-parallel variations in pre-existing structures and crustal composition from the earlier tectonic history of this region. These results highlight the influence of tectonic inheritance on patterns of foreland basin initiation in Cordilleran-style margins.",

The proposed IVS technique termed, bootstrap rank-ordered conditional mutual information for real-valued signals (brCMIr), is multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric, and probabilistic. The brCMIr method was tested in a case study using water demand time series for two urban water supply system pressure zones in Ottawa, Canada to select the most important historical records for use with each machine learning technique in order to generate forecasts of average and peak UWD for the respective pressure zones at lead times of 1, 3, and 7 days ahead. All lead time forecasts are computed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as the base model, and are compared with Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR), as well as a novel machine learning method for UWD forecasting: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Results from one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey Honesty Significance Difference (HSD) tests indicate that the LSSVR and ELM models are the best machine learning techniques to pair with brCMIr. However, ELM has significant computational advantages over LSSVR (and ANN) and provides a new and promising technique to explore in UWD forecasting.",

In this study we researched and compiled fault zone permeability and conceptual permeability models in different geologic settings from published multidisciplinary literature (structural- and hydro-geology, engineering geology of tunnels and mines, and geothermal projects among others). The geospatial database focuses on data-rich regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. Regionalization of the dominant conceptual models of fault zones was regionalized based on geological attributes and tested conceptually with simple numerical models, to help incorporate the effect of fault zones on regional to continental flow models.\nResults show that for large regional and continental scale flow modeling, the fault zone data can be generalized by geology to determine the relative importance of fault conduits vs fault barriers, which can be converted to effective anisotropy ratios for large scale flow, although local fault-controlled flow cells in rift zones require appropriate upscaling. The barrier/conduit properties of fault zones are present in all regions and rock types, and the barrier effect must be properly conceptualized in large scale flow models. The fault zone data from different geologic disciplines have different biases (e.g. outcrop studies, deep drillhole tests, tunnels, etc.) depending on scale of hydraulic tests. Finally, the calibrated recharge estimates for fault controlled flow systems may be lower than for unfaulted flow systems due to predominant barrier (regional anisotropy or permeability reduction), suggesting a “scaling effect” on recharge estimates.",

Direct sub-surface observations are augmented by ice velocity and dynamical constraints to interpolate observations to the surface. Measurements indicate a mean volume flux of 1.0 +/- 0.08 Sv (Sv=10^6 m^3/s) and a mean freshwater flux of 62 mSv from the Arctic Ocean through Nares Strait to the south. About 20% of the volume and 50% of the freshwater flux reside in the top 30-m of the water column.\nFlux variability peaks at a 20-day time scale and correlates strongly with along-channel pressure gradients which explain more than 80% of the flux variance. Seasonal volume flux variations have an amplitude of about 0.1 Sv and a phase that result in maximal and minimal southward transports in March and November, respectively. Ice cover is usually land-fast in March and mobile in November suggesting that the frictional dynamics in a surface layer under the ice are secondary in importance to the along-channel pressure gradient that peaks in early spring with high sea level in the Arctic and low sea level in the more southerly Baffin Bay.\nObserved changes in the duration of land-fast ice conditions impact ocean stratification and flux through Nares Strait. For example, volume and freshwater fluxes increased by 50% and 100% in years when the ice was mobile almost year-round from 2006 through 2010 as compared to the 2003 to 2006 period when the ice was not mobile for more than 6 month per year on average. Local winds explain almost 50% of the variance during the 2007 to 2009 period of year-round mobile ice when a southern ice arch did not form. This ice arch returned to southern Nares Strait in 2011 resulting in long periods of land-fast ice cover and, we hypothesize, reduced ocean flux.",

            "abstract": "Many datasets have complex structures including hundreds of parameters and numerous vertical levels, grid resolutions, and temporal products. Making these data accessible is a challenge for a data provider. OPeNDAP is powerful protocol for delivering in real-time multi-file datasets that can be ingested by many analysis and visualization tools, but for these datasets there are too many choices about how to aggregate. Simple aggregation schemes can fail to support, or at least make it very challenging, for many potential studies based on complex datasets. We address this issue by using a rich file content metadata collection to create a real-time customized OPeNDAP service to match the full suite of access possibilities for complex datasets.\nThe Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and it’s extension, the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) datasets produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and hosted by the Research Data Archive (RDA) at the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at NCAR are examples of complex datasets that are difficult to aggregate with existing data server software. CFSR and CFSv2 contain 141 distinct parameters on 152 vertical levels, six grid resolutions and 36 products (analyses, n-hour forecasts, multi-hour averages, etc.) where not all parameter/level combinations are available at all grid resolution/product combinations. These data are archived in the RDA with the data structure provided by the producer; no additional re-organization or aggregation have been applied. Since 2011, users have been able to request customized subsets (e.g. - temporal, parameter, spatial) from the CFSR/CFSv2, which are processed in delayed-mode and then downloaded to a user’s system. Until now, the complexity has made it difficult to provide real-time OPeNDAP access to the data. We have developed a service that leverages the already-existing subsetting interface and allows users to create a virtual dataset with its own structure (das, dds). The user receives a URL to the customized dataset that can be used by existing tools to ingest, analyze, and visualize the data. This presentation will detail the metadata system and OPeNDAP server that enable user-customized real-time access and show an example of how a visualization tool can access the data.",

Another one is the remediation of polluted soils: the foam is injected into the ground in order to mobilize chemical species present in the medium. Apart from potential interesting physico-chemical and biochemical properties, foams have peculiar flow properties that applications might benefit of. In particular, viscous dissipation arises mostly from the contact zones between the soap films and the walls, which results in peculiar friction laws allowing the foam to invade narrow pores more efficiently than Newtonian fluids would. In most experimental studies no local information of the foam structure is possible, and only global quantities such as the effective viscosity can be measured.\nUsing two-dimensional transparent flow cells, we have previously shown that foam structural [1] and elastic [2] effects significantly impact the flow of foams in porous media. We now present an investigation of foam flow through a two-dimensional (2D) porous medium consisting of circular obstacles positioned randomly in a Hele-Shaw cell (see figure). The foam structure is recorded in time by a video camera and subsequently analyzed by image processing, which provides us with the velocity field and spatial distribution of bubble sizes. The flow exhibits a rich phenomenology, including flow irreversibility, preferential flow paths, local flow intermittency/non-stationarity (despite the imposed permanent global flow rate). Moreover, the medium impacts the nature of the flowing fluid by selecting the bubble size through bubble fragmentation. We investigate how preferential flow paths and intermittency depend on the imposed global flow rate and foam quality (the water content), and show that the spatial distribution of bubble sizes is to some extent correlated with the velocity field. We furthermore measure the evolution, along the flow direction, of the probability density function for bubble sizes, and present a fragmentation model to explain that evolution.\n",

INTRODUCTION\nThe first version can be used onboard during the survey to get a quick overview of acquired data, or later, to re-process data with accurate environmental data.\nII. MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES\nThe version shown at AGU-2014 will present several key items :\n- 3D visualization: DTM multi-layers from EMODNet,\n- Water Column echogram, Seismic lines, ...\n- Bathymetry Plug-In: manual and automatic data cleaning, integration of EMODNet methodology to\nintroduce CDI concept, filtering, spline, data gridding, ...\n- Backscatter with compensation,\n- Tectonic toolset,\n- Photo/Video Plug-In\n- Navigation 3D including tide correction, MRU corrections, GPS offsets correction,\n- WMS/WFS interfaces.\nIII. FOCUS ON EMODNET \nOne of the main objectives of the EMODNet European project is to elaborate a common processing flow for gridding\nthe bathymetry data and for generating harmonized digital terrain model (DTM) : this flow includes the definition of the\nDTM characteristics (geodetic parameters, grid spacing, interpolation and smoothing parameters…) and also the\nspecifications of a set of layers which enrich the basic depth layer : statistical layers (sounding density, standard\ndeviation,…) and an innovative data source layer which indicates the source of the soundings and and which is linked\nand collects to the associated metadata.\nGLOBE Software provides the required tools for applying this methodology and is offered to the project partners.\nV. FOCUS ON THE TECTONIC TOOLSET\nThe tectonic toolset allows the user to associate any DTM to 3D rotation movements. These rotations represent the\nmovement of tectonic plates along discrete time lines (from 200 million years ago to now). One rotation is described by its\naxes, its value angle and its date. GLOBE can display the movement of tectonic plates, represented by a DTM, at\ndifferent geological times. The same movements can be operated for geotiff images or GMT files representing grids\nfor any kind of data.\nThe free software GLOBE3D is a product of Ifremer and is funded by Carnot-Edrome",

            "abstract": "Lunar floor-fractured craters are a class of 170 craters characterized by their anomalously shallow, heavily fractured floors; associated floor morphologies include deposits of mare material, pyroclastic deposits, and vents. Floor-fractured craters are located in close proximity to surface mare deposits, and are also closely associated with both the interiors and edges of lunar basins. The interior volcanic features, in conjunction with the morphologic and morphometric characteristics of the craters, suggest a formation consistent with subcrater magmatic intrusion and sill formation. Morphometric data suggests that the areal extent of the intrusion mirrors the dimensions of the crater floor, and that the intrusion does not extend past the crater wall region. The intrusion thickness can be calculated by comparing the observed depth of the craters with the predicted depth of a crater of similar diameter, and the averaged intrusion thickness is ~ 1 km. Thus these intrusions represent large subsurface magmatic provinces. We investigate the evolution of these large magmatic intrusions with emphasis on how the degassing of the intrusion leads to pyroclastic eruptions in certain craters, and whether these eruptions utilize fractures created by the tectonic deformation of the crater floor, or if they instead form from subsidiary diking off of the intrusion. We also investigate the amount of volatiles necessary to produce the pyroclastic eruptions, considering both inherent volatiles in the magma, and volatiles generated by reactions during the shallow subsurface evolution of the magma. The craters Alphonsus and Humboldt serve as ideal study cases to compare and contrast floor morphology, fracture location, and observed volcanic deposits. The results of this analysis have importance for why pyroclastic eruptions occurred in certain locations, and it also has implications for the volatile budget of lunar magmas.",

            "abstract": "The SAIL-Thermique model was developed to simulate thermal infrared (TIR) radiative transfers inside vegetation canopies and land surface emissivity. It is based on the SAIL model developed by Verhoef (1984) for simulating spectral reflectances in the solar domain. Due to the difficulty to measure land surface emissivity, no emissivity model was validated against ground measurements. In this study, several datasets extracted from the literature and from recent databases were used for evaluating emissivity simulations. Model simulations were performed from the knowledge of leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution, direction of viewing, and leaf and soil optical properties. As data on leaf inclination and leaf optical properties were usually not available, stochastic simulations were performed from a priori knowledges on their distribution (extracted from the literature and recent databases). Simulated 8-14 µm emissivities were favorably compared to measurements with a root mean square difference (RMSD) around 0.006 (0.004 when considering only herbaceous species).\nThe model was then used for simulating emissivity spectra for providing information for the interpretation of TIR multispectral data from the ASTER sensor. We used the land surface emissivity simulations for re-assessing the TES algorithm used to separate emissivity and land surface temperature. We showed that the inclusion of vegetated land surfaces significantly modified the relationship between minimum emissivity and minimum maximum difference (εmin- MMD) which is at the heart of the TES algorithm. This relationship was originally established on the ASTER spectral library which did not include vegetated land surface (Schmugge et al. 1998). On a synthetic database, estimations of spectral emissivities and surface temperature were significantly improved when using the new εmin- MMD relationship in comparison to the classical one: RMSD dropped from ~0.012 to ~0.006 for spectral emissivity and from 0.60 K to 0.33 K for surface temperature.\nThis showed the importance of including vegetation canopies when establishing the εmin- MMD relation. The approach can be applied to the development of TES algorithms for any existing TIR multispectral sensors (MODIS, MASTER...) or future sensors (HyspIRI, THIRSTY...).",

            "abstract": "Evaluating the potential response of the West Antarctic ice streams to changing climatic conditions depends sensitively on the behavior of the shear margins, which play an important role in the force balance of active ice streams. Previous modeling efforts and field observations have raised the possibility of shear-induced melting in ice-stream margins, highlighting the potentially important role of hydrological processes for understanding margin stability. The goal of this paper is to couple the thermomechanical behavior of shear margins to the subglacial hydrology at the bed. An important component of our model is that we solve for the margin positions self-consistently instead of enforcing margin positions apriori.\nOur 2D model represents a cross-section through the ice-stream margin perpendicular to the downstream flow direction. We assume that the ice flows over a bed consisting of Coulomb-plastic till. The position and extent of the ice stream is determined by where the shear stress at the bed attains the local and spatially variable yield stress. If the basal stress falls below the yield stress, the ice is assumed to lock to the bed. While a simplified variation of this model setup can be solved analytically, we adopt a numerical treatment to be able to incorporate a realistic ice rheology.\nThe mechanical, thermal and hydrological model are linked through melt water generation and flow: For a given yield stress at the bed, we compute the margin positions and the anti-plane strain in our mechanical model. The resulting shear heating is then used as a source term in the thermal model to estimate the extent of the temperate zone and amount of melt water produced in the ice. Assuming that the melt water rains down vertically to the bed, we estimate the pore pressure distribution, which in turn determines the yield stress, in our hydrological model. Changing hydrological conditions at the bed are thus intrinsically coupled to the mechanical and thermal properties of the margin and the margin position.",

            "abstract": "Remote marine clouds, such as those over the Southern Ocean, are particularly sensitive to variations in the concentration and chemical composition of aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Observational evidence indicates that the organic content of fine marine aerosol is greatly increased during the biologically active season near strong phytoplankton blooms in certain locations, while being nearly constant in other locations.\nWe have recently developed a novel modeling framework that mechanistically links the organic fraction of submicron sea spray to ocean biogeochemistry (Burrows et al., in discussion, ACPD, 2014; Elliott et al., ERL, 2014). Because of its combination of large phytoplankton blooms and high wind speeds, the Southern Ocean is an ideal location for testing our understanding of the processes driving the enrichment of organics in sea spray aerosol. Comparison of the simulated OM fraction with satellite observations shows that OM fraction is a statistically significant predictor of cloud droplet number concentration over the Southern Ocean.\nThis presentation will focus on predictions from our modeling framework for the Southern Ocean, specifically, the predicted geographic gradients and seasonal cycles in the aerosol organic matter and its functional group composition. The timing and location of a Southern Ocean field campaign will determine its utility in observing the effects of highly localized and seasonal phytoplankton blooms on aerosol composition and clouds.\n",

            "abstract": "The SALSA3D (SAndia LoS Alamos 3D) global three-dimensional P-velocity tomography model of the Earth’s crust and mantle has been shown to significantly improve seismic event location accuracy and precision, compared to standard 1D and 2/2.5D models. This improvement has been demonstrated using data from the International Monitoring System (IMS), a sparse, global seismic network. In relocation tests using the IMS network and a set of seismic events with ground truth (GT) levels of 5 km or better, over 80% of the defining arrivals are regional Pn (15%) or teleseismic P phases (65.1%). There is a small percentage of phases that requires a model that supports secondary phase prediction. We plan to update the SALSA3D model to include an S-velocity component as well as an updated P-velocity model using secondary compressional phases.\nOur model is derived from the latest version of the GT catalog of travel-time picks assembled by Los Alamos National Laboratory. The model is represented using the triangular tessellation system described by Ballard et al. (2009), which incorporates variable resolution in both the geographic and radial dimensions. For our starting model, we use a simplified layer crustal model derived from the Crust 1.0 model, overlying a uniform ak135 mantle. Sufficient damping is used to reduce velocity adjustments so that ray path changes between iterations are small. We obtain proper model smoothness by using progressive grid refinement, refining the grid only in areas where it is warranted by the available data. Our approach produces a smooth, multi-resolution model with node density appropriate to both ray coverage and the velocity gradients required by the data.\nWe compare the travel-time prediction and location capabilities of the updated SALSA3D model to standard 1D and 2/2.5D models via location tests on a global event set with GT of 5 km or better. We compare location results using a subset of these events that have a significant number of phases with which to produce random realizations of actual arrival data. In addition, further tests will involve using GT5 or better events and their arrivals specifically for the IMS network, to test the use of a 3D model on an operational network intended for explosion monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Stakeholders in the coastal zone, particularly the urban coasts, are turning to science to get information on future Local Sea Level (LSL) rise. Many scientists and scientific committees respond to this request with a range of plausible trajectories (RPT) defined by a number of possible trajectories each corresponding to a certain scenario. Often these assessments take a starting point in the small number of global sea level trajectories provided by the IPCC. This approach is inherently deterministic. The resulting RPT, which can be quite large, is considered as reflecting “uncertainty in LSL projections.” Non-scientists often use the RPT to select a preferred and much narrower sub-RPT, for which they plan, or they use the “large uncertainty” to justify not taking any measures. In response to societal needs, science focuses on a reduction of the uncertainties through improved deterministic models. This approach has a number of problems: (1) The complexity of LSL as the outcome of many local, regional and global earth system processes, including anthropogenic processes, renders a deterministic approach to prediction invalid. (2) Most assessments of the RPT account for an incomplete set of relevant earth system processes, and for each processes make assumptions that (often arbitrarily) constrain the contribution from this process. (3) LSL is an inherently probabilistic variable that has a broad probability density function (PDF), with a complex dependency of this PDF on the PDFs of the many contributing processes. In particular, the contribution from the large ice sheets has a PDF with low-probability high-impact tails that are generally neglected in deterministic LSL projections and in the sub-RPT used for coastal planning. A fully probabilistic assessment of the risk associated with LSL rise indicates that the standard deterministic assessment not only neglect most of the low-probability, high-risk tail of the PDF but also medium-probability, high-risk parts. This creates a high potential for low or medium-probability events that could challenge a global civilization, which is depending on crucial coastal infrastructure with growing urban coasts built under the principle assumption that future LSL will not change much more than what civilization experienced during the (geologically short) past.",

            "abstract": "Wild rice (Zizania palustris, manoomin) is an emergent aquatic plant that grows annually in the northern Great Lakes region of North America. This region is also rich in iron ore deposits and correspondingly has an extensive history of mining activities. Wild rice no longer grows in some areas where it was previously abundant. Sandy Lake, located in St. Louis County on federally protected lands that are ceded territory of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Minnesota and downstream of the nearby U.S. Steel Minntac mine, was selected as a test site. This lake has a history of ricing activities by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) People, for whom manoomin has cultural importance. Lake cores were taken on June 17, 2014 by LacCore and FDLRM staff and samples were obtained. This project used phytolith analysis to answer the question of past wild rice presence and abundance in Sandy Lake. Phytoliths are microscopic opal silica deposits produced in some plants. Zizania palustris produces phytolith morphotypes that are unequivocally diagnostic of this species in this region. Microscopic slides were prepared and analyzed for wild rice phytoliths. Concentration values ranged from 25 to 4379 phytoliths per cm3/year, and wild rice accumulation figures ranged from 7 to 789 phytoliths/cm2/year, the maximum values of which occurred in the 1920s and generally declined to the current lowest levels observed. Mining has likely impacted wild rice populations by causing increased sulfate levels and possibly contributing to higher lake levels.",

            "abstract": "In order to measure sediment flux in Porter Creek, a small tributary to the North Fork of the Siuslaw River near Florence Oregon, we have deployed ~600 pieces of tracer gravel embedded with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, 8 fixed antennas, and 9 logging pressure transducers spaced along 130 m of channel comprising 3 wood jams and substrates of sand, gravel, cobble, and bedrock. Tracer deployment is uniform along the instrumented reach, analogous to constant-source solute or dye injection, so that sediment flux [L3/T] for the ith grain size class is Qi = niVpiFi/fTi, where ni is count rate, [T-1], Vpi is particle volume, and Fi and fTi are fractional coverage of the ith size class of grains and tracers, respectively. Tracer concentrations, fTi, must be large enough for accurate estimation of ni = 1/TAi where TAi is the mean inter-arrival time of tracers at an antenna, during a period of nearly constant discharge. A square wave or constant sediment injection is undertaken by placing a concentration of tracers dispersed upstream of the study reach, such that it will add to the concentration within the study reach as gravels migrate downstream, replacing the gravels within the antenna network. Preliminary results show dispersion values ranging from ~7 m2/month for 8-16mm size fraction, to ~0.2 m2/month for 32-64mm size fraction, with travel distances of 60 meters for the 8-16mm, 16 meters for the 16-32mm, 8 meters for the 32-64mm, and 4 meters for the >64mm for 1 water year. Since there is a high level of variability in dispersion within the antennae array given the heterogeneity of substrates and wood placed within the system, it is likely that some tracers will need to be added within the regions between antennae after high water events. The tracer concentration within the regions occupied between antennae must remain at such a level as to provide viable statistical relationships between tracer and non-tracer gravels, and percent mobile versus percent stationary.",

            "abstract": "With rapid change unfolding throughout the Arctic, the need for actionable Arctic science has never been greater. A warming climate is reshaping Arctic ecosystems, bringing changes such as the loss of sea ice and glaciers, thawing of permafrost, and changing snow patterns. These shifts challenge Arctic citizens who must adapt to new environmental conditions, and have significant global implications. A 2014 National Research Council report, The Arctic in the Anthropocene: Emerging Research Questions, identifies research questions important for understanding how environmental and societal transitions will affect the Arctic and the rest of the world. It also assesses what is required to address these questions, and points to the need to translate research findings into practical information that can help guide management and policy decisions. Drawing upon the report, this presentation will focus on the scientific research questions identified under five categories: Evolving Arctic, Hidden Arctic, Connected Arctic, Managed Arctic, and Undetermined Arctic. It will also address methods to meet the challenges and assess what is needed to leverage efficiencies in making Arctic research happen, from collaboration and coordination to sustained observations, building human and operational capacity, making information actionable as well as accessible, and possible changes in funding approaches. It will demonstrate that fostering a sense of shared purpose to manage change to the best of our abilities is essential, as is a continued commitment to studying what exists, what is emerging, and what awaits us in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Environmental offset schemes employ a crediting system to mitigate the impacts of pollutants. In this talk, we present a novel trade-off concept comparing diverse groups of pollutants: environmental flows, micropollutants (heavy metals, pesticides, estrogen compounds) and nutrients in a test watershed (Jacksons Creek), in the vicinity of Melbourne. A reservoir in the upper watershed, and a wastewater treatment plant (WTP) are the main sources of flow into Jacksons Creek. The current land use is a mix of agriculture, and rural, though rapid urbanization is anticipated with a 40% increase in the population by 2040. The creek is impacted by: 1) low flow, especially during dry periods (contribution from the reservoir drops dramatically), 2) nutrient enrichment (WTP and agricultural runoff), and 3) micropollutants-heavy metals (urban runoff), estrogenic compounds (WTP), and pesticides (agricultural runoff).\nIn this offset framework, we evaluated current and future scenarios to identify the main stressor in Jacksons Creek. We collected monitoring data at 15 sites for separate 3 events. Then we developed a watershed model to assess sources of pollutant loads to the creek, using two different tools, Model for Urban Stormwater Improvement Conceptualisation (MUSIC) for the preliminary flow and water quality modeling, and eWater Source for integrated water resource management (IWRM), and a decision support system for stakeholders. Scenario analysis includes urbanization and population growth, and anticipated discharges from WTP and the reservoir.\nMeasured nutrient concentrations were high for all sampling events. Micropollutants were detected at a concentration higher than the trigger value at several locations. Preliminary analysis shows that low flow is one of the major stressors in the creek causing elevated micropollutant and nutrient concentrations (non-point), and that discharge from the WTP is essential to maintain the minimum environmental flows, though nutrient enrichment downstream could occur. This study demonstrates an innovative case for evaluating net environmental benefits, and might hold important lessons for the design of offset schemes in comparable environments elsewhere.",

Using a Kalman filter allows the TRF to be obtained by combining on a weekly basis time series of station positions and Earth orientation parameters. A core set of globally distributed reference stations that have long (> 3 years) observing histories, a minimum number of discontinuities, and that are unaffected by post-seismic displacements will be used to define the frame. Carefully choosing this set of defining stations allows their geophysical motion to be accurately modeled by a superposition of just linear displacements, harmonic seasonal modes, and when needed, a few discontinuities.

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX), produced from isoprene oxidation under low-NO conditions, can account for a substantial fraction of organic aerosol (OA) in biogenic dominated areas. In this study, IEPOX-SOA was identified from measurements at the forested southeast US supersite (Centreville, AL) during the SOAS campaign using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurement. By combining SOAS results with other field and lab studies, characteristics of IEPOX-SOA spectra in AMS are systematically evaluated. fC5H6O (The fraction of OA measured at C5H6O+, the major ion at m/z 82) in AMS spectra is shown to be a good tracer for IEPOX-SOA. We observed statistically higher fC5H6O in OA from regions with strong isoprene emissions (3×10-3 - 25×10-3) vs. that from urban and biomass-burning plumes (0 - 3.5×10-3, an avg. of 1.75 ×10-3). In isoprene-influenced areas, fC5H6O in ambient OA decreases with OA aging. The decay of fC5H6O in fCO2 vs fC5H6O scatter plot suggests that physical mixing of air masses might play a more important role in ambient atmosphere. Analyzing the decay of IEPOX-SOA in an oxidation flow reactor results in an empirical kOH for IEPOX-SOA chemical aging of 5.310-13 cm3 molec.−1 s−1, equivalent to an OH lifetime of 2 weeks (OH avg. of 1.5×106 molec. cm-3). The thermograms of IEPOX-SOA suggest similar or lower volatility than for the bulk OA, indicating that most of the IEPOX-SOA will not evaporate under any atmospheric conditions. This contrasts with the small semivolatile molecules that have been identified so far as IEPOX-SOA components. Finally, we develop a simplified method to estimate ambient IEPOX-SOA mass concentrations as a function of C5H6O+, which is shown to perform well compared to the full PMF method. When only unit mass resolution data is available the method performs less well due to increased interferences from other ions at m/z 82. Estimated IEPOX-SOA concentrations in the southeast US from an aircraft campaign correlate well with IEPOX-related species detected by other techniques, which confirms the validity of this method applied here. IEPOX-SOA accounts for 14-17% of the OA in the SE US. We explore the dependence of IEPOX-SOA on key parameters such as acidity, sulfate, and gas-phase IEPOX concentrations.",

Building upon Basins at Risk (BAR) research, our team used updated Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database georeferenced social and environmental data, quantitative data from global indices, and qualitative data from news media sources. Our assessment considered a combination of analyzing 15 global indices related to water or human security to identify which countries scored as highest risk in each index. From this information, we were able to assess the highest risk countries’ human security risk by using a new human security measurement tool, as well as comparing this analysis to the World Bank’s Fragile States Index and the experimental Human Security Index. In addition, we identified which countries have the highest number of shared basins, the highest percentage of territory covered by a transboundary basin, and the highest dependency of withdrawal from transboundary waters from outside their country boundaries.\nBy synthesizing these social and environmental data assessments, we identified five countries to analyze as case studies. These five countries are Afghanistan, China, Iraq, Moldova, and Sudan. We created a series of 30 maps to spatial analyze the relationship between the transboundary basins and social and environmental parameters to include population, institutional capacity, and physical geography by country. Finally, we synthesized our spatial analysis, Human Security Key scores, and current events scored by using the BAR scale to determine what aspects and which basins are most at risk with each country in our case studies and how this concerns future global water resources.",

The goal and purpose of such a system is to reduce, or minimize, the damage, costs, and casualties resulting from an earthquake. A demonstration earthquake early warning system (ShakeAlert) is undergoing testing in the United States by the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, Caltech, ETH Zurich, University of Washington, the USGS, and beta users in California and the Pacific Northwest. The beta users receive earthquake information very rapidly in real-time and are providing feedback on their experiences of performance and potential uses within their organization.\nBeta user interactions allow the ShakeAlert team to discern: which alert delivery options are most effective, what changes would make the UserDisplay more useful in a pre-disaster situation, and most importantly, what actions users plan to take for various scenarios. Actions could include: personal safety approaches, such as drop cover, and hold on; automated processes and procedures, such as opening elevator or fire stations doors; or situational awareness. Users are beginning to determine which policy and technological changes may need to be enacted, and funding requirements to implement their automated controls.\nThe use of models and mobile apps are beginning to augment the basic Java desktop applet. Modeling allows beta users to test their early warning responses against various scenarios without having to wait for a real event. Mobile apps are also changing the possible response landscape, providing other avenues for people to receive information. All of these combine to improve business continuity and resiliency.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in deep subsurface reservoirs is an attractive strategy for the mitigation and reduction of global CO2 emissions. Previous studies have identified potential geochemical effects of CO2 gas leaks on overlying groundwater aquifers. However, in addition to CO2, other gasses may also be present. For example, methane (CH4) can be present as an impurity in the CO2 gas stream, a native gas, or can be produced within the reservoir or aquifer after the introduction of CO2.\nContinuous and stop-flow column experiments and batch studies were conducted to determine changes in pH and aqueous elemental concentrations and the fate of contaminants (As and Cd) when CH4 is present in addition to CO2 gas. Two sediment samples were obtained from an aquifer overlying potential CO2 storage reservoirs (High Plains Aquifer, KS). Column experiments were conducted with synthetic groundwater (SGW) or As/Cd spiked SGW saturated with a mixture of 99% CO2and 1% CH4 gases. The spiked SGW contained 114 ppb As and 28 ppb Cd to represent maximum contaminant levels present in CO2 reservoir brines as shown in previous modeling studies. Batch experiments were also conducted with spiked SGW, with CO2 or the CO2/CH4 mixture.\nColumn study results showed most elements followed similar concentration trends after injection of CO2/CH4 saturated SGW or spiked SGW. Cd concentrations remained below detection limits for both sediments, with or without the spike. As concentrations were similar between SGW and spiked SGW columns until after the 3rd stop flow. As levels in the spiked SGW column then increased while levels in the SGW column decreased, suggesting the sediments are the source of effluent As until this point. Similar pH values were also observed until the 3rd stop flow event, where the pH of both SGW columns decreased significantly compared to spiked SGW columns. Batch studies showed As concentrations did not decrease as quickly when CH4 was present with the CO2. The concentrations of other elements, including Cd, followed trends similar to the experiments without CH4. Possible effects of redox changes and differences in mineralogy of the two sediments are under investigation. Results of this study, along with those of our previous efforts, are significant for risk evaluation and site selection for CO2 sequestration.",

            "abstract": "We have performed 3D high resolution simulations of underground explosions conducted recently in jointed rock outcrop as part of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE). The main goal is to understand the nature of the shear motions recorded in the near field at depth. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genesis of shear motions: 1) sliding on the joints, 2) wave conversion at the material boundaries and 3) non sphericity of the source. We suggest yet another mechanism to be responsible for some shear wave generation when the cracks or joints are present in the rock mass containing the source and the explosive products find their way into the cracks. In order to investigate this mechanism, we have conducted several high resolution simulations of the source region using an Eulerian hydrodynamic code GEODYN. We explored the effect of joint orientations, number of family of fracture, energy deposition, joint aperture size, and joint spacing on the overall development of the source itself, sustained damage around the source and shear wave polarization and motions in the vicinity of the source. We have observed that waves interact with the joints and refraction and diffraction of the wave intensify the complexity of the wave field. It is worth noting that the fracture network topology has also dramatically been affected. It is expected that after the pressure has been released and the energy has been dissipated that source cavity may shrink to a different size but will sustain considerable irreversible damage which affect subsequent shots if they were to be conducted in the vicinity or at the same depth. Fracture network connectivity has drastically changed which will affect wave motions and flow of gases. To explore those effects, we have coupled STOTRAN code, which handles flow, mass and heat transport of fluids and gases in fractures and fractured porous media with the GEODYN code. We will present recent 2D and 3D simulations of typical settings for SPE experiments and discuss the most likely physical phenomena that took place during the SPE campaign.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Violent conflict and issues surrounding available water resources are both global problems and are connected. Violent conflict is increasingly intrastate in nature and coupled with increased hydrological variability as a function of climate change, there will be increased pressures on water resource use. The majority of mechanisms designed to secure water resources are often based on the presence of a governance framework or another type of institutional capacity, such as offered through a supra- or sub-national organization like the United Nations or a river basin organization. However, institutional frameworks are not present or loose functionality during violent conflict. Therefore, it will likely be extremely difficult to secure water resources for a significant proportion of populations in Fragile and Conflict Affected States. However, the capacity in Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development nations for the appropriate interventions to address this problem is reduced by an increasing reluctance to participate in interventionist operations following a decade of expeditionary warfighting mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and related defence cuts. Therefore, future interventions in violent conflict and securing water resources may be more indirect in nature.\nThis paper assesses the state of understanding key areas in the present literature and highlights the gap of securing water resources during violent conflict in the absence of institutional capacity. There is a need to close this gap as a matter of urgency by formulating frameworks to assess the lack of institutional oversight / framework for water resources in areas where violent conflict is prevalent; developing inclusive resource management platforms through transparency and reconciliation mechanisms; and developing endogenous confidence-building measures and evaluate how these may be encouraged by exogenous initiatives including those facilitated by the international community.\nThis effort will require the development of collaborations between academic, NGO sectors, and national aid agencies in order to allow the development of the appropriate tools, understanding in a broad range of contexts, and the mechanisms that can be brought to bear to address this increasingly important area.",

Building on and now running parallel with a successful internally-funded summer research program already in place and available only to Chapman undergraduates, the SURFEES program incorporates specific mentor and participant pre-experience training, pre-, mid-, and post-assessment instruments, and programming targeted to the earth and environmental sciences as well as to community college students. Perhaps most importantly, the application, selection and pairing of student participants with faculty mentors was conducted with specific goals of identifying those applicants with the greatest potential for a transformative experience while also meeting self-defined targets of under-represented minority, female, and low-income participants.

            "abstract": "Reanalysis datasets are widely used to understand atmospheric processes and past variability, and are often used as “observations” for comparison with climate model output. Because of the central role of water vapour (WV) and ozone (O3) in climate change, it is important to understand how accurately these species are represented in reanalyses, and whether or not significant differences exist among the eight existing global reanalyses.\nThe SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) is aimed at improving understanding of reanalysis products and ultimately contributing to future reanalysis developments. In this presentation, we present initial results from the WV and O3component of S-RIP. Comparisons are made over a range of timescales between the different reanalyses, and between reanalyses and independent observational data from sondes, aircraft, and satellites.\nBecause stratospheric O3 is assimilated in the newer reanalyses, the reanalysis O3 fields are evaluated using common error statistics (e.g., observation-background departures) and comparison with independent non-assimilated data. On the other hand, since stratospheric WV data are not currently assimilated, the fidelity of reanalysis WV is sensitive to how accurately the fundamental drivers of stratospheric WV are represented in the reanalyses. We therefore attempt to relate differences in reanalysis WV to processes known to affect WV such as tropical tropopause layer temperatures, tape recorder speed of propagation, amplitude of the QBO response, and extent of polar dehydration. Ensemble trajectory runs coupled with a dehydration model are used to analyse WV variability related to these processes, and to assess the self-consistency of the reanalysis WV fields in the stratosphere.",

            "abstract": "Seagoing science expeditions offer an ideal opportunity for storytelling. While many disciplines involve fieldwork, few offer the adventure of spending two months at sea on a vessel hundreds of miles from shore with several dozen strangers from all over the world. As a medium, video is nearly ideal for telling these stories; it can capture the thrill of discovery, the agony of disappointment, the everyday details of life at sea, and everything in between.\nAt the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP, formerly the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), we have used video as a storytelling medium for several years with great success. Over this timeframe, camera equipment and editing software have become cheaper and easier to use, while web sites such as YouTube and Vimeo have enabled sharing with just a few mouse clicks. When it comes to telling science stories with video, the barriers to entry have never been lower.\nAs such, we have experimented with many different approaches and a wide range of styles. On one end of the spectrum, live “ship-to-shore” broadcasts with school groups – conducted with an iPad and free videoconferencing software such as Skype and Zoom – enable curious minds to engage directly with scientists in real-time. We have also contracted with professional videographers and animators who offer the experience, skill, and equipment needed to produce polished clips of the highest caliber. Amateur videographers (including some scientists looking to make use of their free time on board) have shot and produced impressive shorts using little more than a phone camera.\nIn this talk, I will provide a brief overview of our efforts to connect with the public using video, including a look at how effective certain tactics are for connecting to specific audiences.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is both a powerful greenhouse gas and a key participant in ozone destruction. Microbial activity accounts for over 70% of the N2O produced annually, and the atmospheric concentration of N2O continues to rise. Because the fungal and bacterial denitrification pathways are major contributors to microbial N2O production, understanding the mechanism by which NO is reduced to N2O will contribute to both N2O source tracing and quantification. Our strategy utilizes stable isotopes to probe the enzymatic mechanism of microbial N2O production. Although the use of stable isotopes to study enzyme mechanisms is not new, our approach is distinct in that we employ both measurements of isotopic preferences of purified enzyme and DFT calculations, thereby providing a synergistic combination of experimental and computational approaches.\nWe analyzed δ18O, δ15Nα (central N atom in N2O), and δ15Nβ (terminal N atom) of N2O produced by purified fungal cytochrome P450 nitric oxide reductase (P450nor) from Histoplasma capsulatum as well as bacterial cytochrome c dependent nitric oxide reductase (cNOR) from Paracoccus denitrificans. P450nor exhibits an inverse kinetic isotope effect for Nβ (KIE = 0.9651) but a normal isotope effect for both Nα (KIE = 1.0127) and the oxygen atom (KIE = 1.0264). These results suggest a mechanism where NO binds to the ferric heme in the P450nor active site and becomes Nβ. Analysis of the NO-binding step indicated a greater difference in zero point energy in the transition state than the ground state, resulting in the inverse KIE observed for Nβ. Following protonation and rearrangement, it is speculated that this complex forms a FeIV-NHOH- species as a key intermediate. Our data are consistent with the second NO (which becomes Nα and O in the N2O product) attacking the FeIV-NHOH- species to generate a FeIII-N2O2H2 complex that enzymatically (as opposed to abiotically) breaks down to release N2O. Conversely, our preliminary data indicate that cNOR exhibits an inverse isotope effect for both Nα and Nβ, but a normal isotope effect for the oxygen. These results are consistent with a very different mechanism for the bimetallic active site in bacterial cNOR in which one NO binds to a non-heme FeB site while the other NO binds to the heme b3 site.",

Mass spectrometric sampling of plume materials enables the detection of molecules that facilitate an assessment of the extent of chemical and biological evolution that may have occurred in a subsurface sea. In laboratory experiments we have investigated the physical and chemical processes that occur in the complex plume environment that lead to ionization of trace organic constituents, both as a result of the freezing of liquid droplets and the thawing of icy particles. We also demonstrate that collisions between icy particles lead to triboelectric charging. Subsequent discharges between oppositely charged particles result not only in the ionization of trace organics but to chemical reactions between molecular components present in the particles. For example, nitriles react with water to form amides and acids. In particular, icy particles doped with small amounts of aminoacetonitrile and water lead to the formation of the simplest amino acid glycine. The implications which these observations may have for sampling plume composition from orbit in a future mission to Enceladus will be discussed.",

We utilize the caibration of the TC/EA – MAT 253 continuous flow system, which permits us to analyze wt.% H2O and its δD extracted from 1–8 mg of glass with as little as 0.1 wt% H2O. Tephra that has been secondarily hydrated with meteoric water is widely used as a paleoenvironmental tool, but the rate of secondary hydration, the relative amounts of primary magmatic (degassed) and secondary meteoric water, and the retention of primary and secondary δD values are not well understood. To quantify these processes, we use a natural experiment involving dated Holocene tepha in Kamchatka and Oregon. Our research illustrates the drastic difference in hydration rates between silicic (hydrated after ~1.5 ka) and mafic tephra, which is not hydrated in the Holocene (similar to results for submarine volcanic glasses), and andesitic tephra with intermediate degrees of hydration. The 0.05-7.3 ka basaltic scoria from Klyuchevskoy volcano retains ≤0.45 wt.% primary magmatic H2O, with δD values from -99 to -121 ‰. Four other 0.05–7.6 ka basaltic tephra units from Kamchatka with <57 wt.% SiO2 all have wt.% H2O 0.21–0.84 and δD values ranging from -90 – -145 ‰. The 1.0–7.6 ka andesitic tephra have slightly higher water contents (0.9–3.0 %) and slightly lower δD values (-113 – -146 ‰). Seven 0.3–7.9 ka silicic samples with SiO2 >65 wt.% have higher (1.5 -3.4) wt.% H2O and δD values between -115 – -160 ‰. We interpret the lower δD values and higher water contents (opposite of the magmatic degassing trend) to be a characteristic of secondary hydration in regions of higher latitude such as Kamchatka and Oregon. We are also investigating 7.7 ka Mt. Mazama tephra in Oregon that are known to be fully hydrated and cover nearly 5000 km2 northeast of Crater Lake and range in elevation from ~1.3–1.9 km to understand the δD and δ18O details of the hydrated water’s correspondence with local Holocene meteoric waters. In the future, we plan to use a combination of δD in mid-high latitude precipitation to delineate δD-H2O hydration trends to better understand the distinction between primary magmatic and secondary meteoric water in volcanic glass, and the exchange of hydrogen isotopes between OH- and H2Omol sites in volcanic glass.",

Given that most synchrotron facilities have user programs which grant academic researchers access to facilities and x-ray imaging equipment free of charge, a key limitation or hindrance for small research groups interested in conducting x-ray imaging experiments is the financial cost associated with post-experiment data analysis. While the cost of high performance computing hardware continues to decrease, expenses associated with licensing commercial software packages for quantitative image analysis continue to increase, with current prices being as high as $24,000 USD, for a single user license.\nAs construction of the Nation's newest synchrotron accelerator nears completion, a significant effort is being made here at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), to provide an open-source, experiment-to-publication toolbox that reduces the financial and technical ‘activation energy’ required for performing sophisticated quantitative analysis of multidimensional porous media data sets, collected using cutting-edge x-ray imaging techniques. Implementation focuses on leveraging existing open-source projects and developing additional tools for quantitative analysis.

The aim of this study is to conduct health impact assessment by utilizing regionally and spatially specific data in order to assess the influence of alternative emission strategies on human health. In the first stage of this investigation, a modeling study was carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem; Grell et al., 2005) to estimate ambient concentrations of air pollutants. The model set-up included a nesting approach, where three domains with horizontal resolution of 18 km, 6 km and 2 km were defined. The investigation area included the city of Munich (1.5 million inhabitants). The model performance has been evaluated against available air quality observations from the monitoring database “AirBase”. The chemical species including O3, NO, NO2 and PM10 simulated by WRF/Chem compare favorably with the observations. The model performs especially well in resolving the observed O3 concentrations. In the ongoing study, different emission reduction scenarios are compared to a baseline 2009 scenario based on Germany's National Emissions Inventory. To investigate health effects associated with air pollution concentrations a local-scale health impact assessment (HIA) will be conducted. Concentration-response functions (CRFs) link the change in mortality rates to the change in concentrations of air pollutants. CRFs are applied to population-weighted mean concentrations to estimate relative risks and hence estimate numbers of attributable deaths and associated life-years lost. The health benefits that we assume with introducing alternative air quality strategies can be used to provide options for future policy decisions to achieve the reduction of emissions and thereby premature deaths.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of methane dynamics in peatlands is essential to improve understanding of peatlands contribution to carbon balance and interaction with climate. Of the two peatland types, natural fens are known to be a larger contributor of methane emissions to the atmosphere than natural bogs. This study uses geophysical methods integrated with in-situ direct measurements and chamber fluxes to improve understanding of temporal and spatial variation in methane production, accumulation and emissions from natural montane fen in Alberta Canada. Meteorological data and peat cores (~150 cm) were collected to study factors affecting methane production, accumulation and emissions from the Sibbald Research Wetland, a montane fen in the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta.\nOur results show a direct correlation between methane accumulation and degree of peat humification, substrate quality and porosity. Changes in temperature, pressure and water table position were shown to relate to ebullition events, with the highest number of ebullition events occurring from late August to early November. The geophysical results indicate a small spatial variation in free phase biogenic gas accumulation within the studied area. Diffusive methane fluxes were correlated to plant productivity on both daily and seasonal time scales with patterns varying between plots dominated by Juncus sp. and Carex spp. These results highlight the interacting ecological and physical controls on peatland methane dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Kalman Filter has been widely used for dynamic monitoring in reservoir engineering, and has recently gained popularity in hydrogeologic applications. A common characteristic of such applications is that the physical processes of interest are greatly affected by preferential flow (e.g., contaminant spreading, CO2 leakage), which can only be delineated if the problem is finely discretized into a large number of unknowns. However, for problems with large numbers of unknowns (e.g., larger than 10,000), the Kalman Filter has prohibitively expensive computation and storage costs. The EnKF, which is typically used to reduce the cost of computing the covariance in such cases converges slowly to the best estimate, and for a reasonable number of realizations, the estimate may not be accurate, especially for strongly heterogeneous systems. We present the Spectral Kalman Filter, a new Kalman Filter implementation that has a dramatically reduced computational cost compared to the full Kalman Filter, with comparable or higher accuracy than the EnKF for the same computational cost. Our algorithm’s computational efficiency is achieved by a recurrence that updates small cross-covariance matrices instead of large covariance matrices, in combination with a low-rank approximation of the noise covariance matrix. In addition, instead of computing the expensive Jacobian matrix, a matrix-free method is used to obtain sensitivities. Finally, the error of our method can be explicitly controlled by reducing the time between matrix updates. The frequency of these updates is controlled independently from the data assimilation steps. We demonstrate the performance of the Spectral Kalman Filter for the joint estimation of domain properties and state evolution by assimilation of quasi-continuous data during a hypothetical CO2 injection in a heterogeneous domain.",

            "abstract": "The increased vulnerability of deltaic communities to coastal flooding as a result of upstream engineering has been acknowledged for decades. What has received less attention is the sensitivity of deltas to the interactions of river basin modifications and cultivation and irrigation in their coastal regions, particularly in tropical deltas. Embanking, tilling, and crop or stock choice all affect the movement of sediment and water on deltas. Combined with reduced river and sediment discharge, soil and water management practices in coastal areas may in fact exacerbate the risk of tidal flooding, erosion of arable land, and salinization of soils and groundwater associated with sea level rise. Thus exists a cruel irony to smallholder subsistence farmers whose priorities are food, water and economic security, rather than sustainability of the regional environment. Such issues challenge disciplinary approaches and require integrated social-biophysical models able to understand and diagnose these complex relationships. The complementary Institutional Analysis and Development and SocioEcological Systems frameworks are applied to the southwestern Bengal Delta (Bangladesh). The method helps to define the relevant social and physical units operating on the common pool of environmental resources, those of climate, water and sediment. The conceptual frameworks are designed to inform development of a nested geospatial analysis and a dynamic coupled model to identify the social-biophysical feedbacks associated with smallholder soil and water management practices, coastal dynamics, and climate vulnerability in rural Bangladesh. Our presentation will discuss components of the conceptual frameworks and will introduce a bi-directional pilot study designed for obtaining and disseminating information about environmental change to farmers in southwest Bangladesh with potential application to rural farming communities in other tropical deltas.",

Unconfined channels have high or low quantities of wood, but confined channels store little wood biomass. Within this geomorphic context, forest stand age is also critical; streams draining old growth forests (>350 y) have much higher wood loads and log jam densities than either younger, unmanaged forests (>120 y) or intensively managed forests. Reaches with extensive log jams have anastomosing channels, large pool volumes, and high amounts of organic carbon (OC) storage both as wood and as sediment. We hypothesized that these reaches would be much more biogeochemically active with higher rates of primary production, ecosystem respiration, and nitrate removal. Nitrate removal was undetectable in most single-thread channels, and was much higher in reaches with extensive log jams. Ecosystem respiration was also much higher in reaches with log jams. The mechanism for greater nitrate removal and higher ecosystem respiration is increased organic matter storage. Jams stored 10 times more sediment OC than unjammed reaches. Bioassays showed that this OC had high rates of denitrification which may have stimulated NO3 uptake in these reaches. Forest control of channel morphology dramatically altered biogeochemical cycling with higher rates of OC retention cycling and increased net N removal.",

            "abstract": "Annual expeditions, that make use of ships, moorings and ice tethered platforms, have monitored oceanographic conditions in the Beaufort Gyre Region of the Canada Basin since 2003. These basin-wide surveys, together with available earlier data, show linkages between the physical, geo-chemical and ecosystem components during a period of rapid change, largely forced by increased multi-year ice melt and a prolonged anticyclonic phase of the Arctic Ocean circulation. The resulting Ekman convergence has led to a progressive accumulation of river and ice-melt-derived freshwater within the gyre, an increase in surface stratification and depression of the halocline. These changes in physical state have led to a decrease in aragonite saturation state, a deepening of the top of the nutricline and subsurface chlorophyll maximum and a shift in phytoplankton size spectra. Recent years have shown a slight relaxation of the Beaufort Gyre, in addition to large variation in ice cover, leading to informed speculation that the gyre may now be poised to release some of its accumulated freshwater as a salinity anomaly into the global system.",

            "abstract": "Fluid–rock interactions in geothermal reservoirs are driven by the state of disequilibrium that persists among solid and solutes due to changing temperature and pressure. During operation of enhanced geothermal systems, injection of cooled water back into the reservoir disturbs the initial thermodynamic equilibrium between the reservoir and its geothermal fluid, which may induce modifications in permeability through changes in porosity and pore space geometry, consequently bringing about several impairments to the overall system.\nModeling of fluid-rock interactions induced by injection of cold brine into Groß Schönebeck geothermal reservoir system situated in the Rotliegend sandstone at 4200m depth have been done by coupling geochemical modeling Code Phreeqc with OpenGeoSys. Through batch modeling the re-evaluation of the measured hydrochemical composition of the brine has been done using Quintessa databases, the results from the calculation indicate that a mineral phases comprising of K-feldspar, hematite, Barite, Calcite and Dolomite was found to match the hypothesis of equilibrium with the formation fluid, Reducing conditions are presumed in the model (pe = -3.5) in order to match the amount of observed dissolved Fe and thus considered as initial state for the reactive transport modeling. based on a measured composition of formation fluids and the predominant mineralogical assemblage of the host rock, a preliminary 1D Reactive transport modeling (RTM) was run with total time set to 30 years; results obtained for the initial simulation revealed that during this period, no significant change is evident for K-feldspar. Furthermore, the precipitation of calcite along the flow path in the brine results in a drop of pH from 6.2 to a value of 5.2 noticed over the simulated period. The circulation of cooled fluid in the reservoir is predicted to affect the temperature of the reservoir within the first 100 -150m from the injection well. Examination of porosity change in this simulation reveals that, porosity and permeability near the wellbore are enhanced after injection. This is chiefly due to the dissolution of calcite near the injection well and less extent by dolomite The porosity is improved by more than 14% at the injection well, but then decreases away from the well.",

            "abstract": "Strong evidence has proved that the global sea-level is now rising at an increased rate and it is projected to continue to rise. However the rise of the sea-level is not uniform around the world. The local or relative sea-level rise will be of great concern to the coastal regions. The combination of the land subsidence and global sea-level rise causes the relative sea-level to rise. Relative sea-level rise increases the risk of flooding and wetland loss problems in near coastal areas, which in turn have important economic, environmental, and human health consequences for the heavily populated and ecologically important coastal region. However the role played by the coastal land subsidence is commonly absent during the discussion of sea-level rise problems. The sea-level can be measured in two ways: satellite altimetry and tide gauges. The sea-level measured by satellite is called the geocentric sea-level that is relative to earth center and the one measured by tide gauges is called local sea-level that is relative to the land. The tide gauge measurements of the local sea-level do not distinguish between whether the water is rising or the land is subsiding. In some coastal areas, land subsidence is occurring at a higher rate than the geocentric sea-level is rising. This can have a great local effect. GPS technology has proven to be efficient and accurate for measuring and tracking absolute land elevation change. There are about 300 publically available Continuously Operating ",

            "abstract": "Dust from high latitudes is underappreciated and little studied. We recently identified new sites of dust formation, and a new dust generation mechanism, from the southern AK coastline, in Crusius et al, 2011. Dust is generated each autumn from glacierized river valleys as river levels and discharge decrease following summer peak glacier melt. The most prominent such river is the Copper River, the single largest freshwater source to the Gulf of Alaska. Each autumn the exposed river floodplains contain abundant, fine glacial flour and represent a large dust source region, prior to significant snowfall. Strong katabatic winds channeled down mountain river valleys generate dust from the fine glacial flour, which is transported as much as several hundred kilometers into the ocean. This dust is an important source of Fe to the Gulf of Alaska, where phytoplankton growth is limited by available Fe (a micronutrient). Glaciers are rapidly losing mass in this region, so there is an increasing supply of fine glacial flour during the summer melt season, and possibly increased deposition of fine glacial flour in the dust source regions. We initiated continuous, year-round time-series measurements of dust concentration, and its geochemical composition, in August of 2011 on Middleton Island, AK, which lies in the path of the dust plume extending from the Copper River valley. Dust is clearly generated from other glacierized river valleys along the southern coast of AK, as well. We will discuss results from our continuous record spanning three dust seasons, which prominently shows these events each autumn, and displays substantial interannual variability. Dust appears to remain in the boundary layer, but is transported hundreds of kilometers into the ocean, into Fe-limited waters. It is also possible that some of this dust is redeposited on snow or glacier surfaces, enhancing melting. This dust source is not accounted for in typical global dust models.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers are a reservoir of mercury and other trace elements that have accumulated in the ice from atmospheric deposition during the industrial era. As glaciers continue to melt at an alarming rate, potentially toxic metals are released from the ice to the environment. In order to evaluate the impact of glacier melt on water quality in high elevation catchments in Grand Teton National Park, we sampled transects along the Teton and Middle Teton glaciers and proglacial streams during early-July and mid-August 2013. The glaciers were snow-covered during July, and thus water samples were primarily melt of snowpack from the previous winter. During August, the glacier ice was exposed across the ablation zone. The contrasting sample sets from July and August allowed for a comparison of water chemistry of snowmelt and glacier melt, respectively. The Teton Glacier transect included ten sample sites: four samples of surface drainage on the glacier, three near the terminal moraine, and three in Glacier Gulch stream. The Middle Teton transect included thirteen sample sites: one above the glacier, four of surface drainage on the glacier, two near the terminal moraine, two at the moraine of adjacent Teepe Glacier, and four in Garnet Canyon stream. All water samples were analyzed for total and methyl mercury, a suite of trace elements (including U, Sr, and Mn), solutes, and stable water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O). A subset of samples were analyzed for tritium to differentiate recent snowmelt from older ice melt. Preliminary results indicate that snowmelt and glacier melt were a significant source of total mercury, with little additional inputs downstream of the glaciers. Methyl mercury concentrations increased downstream of the glaciers, possibly indicating that mercury from the glaciers undergoes methylation in the proglacial streams. Other trace elements were found in low concentrations in melt water, but increased substantially downstream of the glaciers likely due to water-rock interactions. This study has implications for evaluating the relative impacts of atmospheric deposition, weathering, and other trace element sources to high alpine lakes and streams.",

            "abstract": "Spectrometers provide our most detailed diagnostics of the solar coronal plasma, and spectral data is routinely used to measure the temperature, density, and flow velocity in coronal features. However spectrographs suffer from a limited instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV), and imaging instruments, on the other hand, can provide a relatively large IFOV but offer only very limited spectral resolution. In previous work, synthetic data was produced which had spectral properties derived from the observations of the Hinode/EIS spectrometer. We assumed observations in multiple spectral orders, then used an inverse problem method to infer the spectral properties of the solar source. Physical constraints and regularization derived from prior knowledge were incorporated as part of the solution process.\nHowever in previous work a single emission line without overlapping from neighboring lines was assumed. In this paper we present solutions of a more realistic case solving for spectral line intensity, Doppler shift, and Gaussian width in the case where overlapping lines are present.",

            "abstract": "This presentation provides an overview of a field project in the rainforest of the Brazilian Amazon region conducted during April to July 2014. Objectives were to investigate turbulent transport and chemical processing of vegetation emitted gases to assess the role of the forest in aerosol production. Turbulence within and above the 35-m forest was investigated with 10 sonic anemometers deployed on a 50-m tower. Temporal and spatial distribution of plant-emitted hydrocarbons, and reactive chemical species such as ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides were determined using gas analyzers and mass spectrometers to estimate aerosol yields from hydrocarbon photo-oxidation. Particle sizes and concentrations were investigated with aerosol spectrometers. The upper canopy experienced strong turbulence, with standard deviation of vertical velocity normalized by the friction velocity similar to values above the forest. The lower canopy maintained a quiescent state with turbulence being four times weaker than near the canopy top. Such weak turbulent state is conducive to the development of strong and pronounced hydrocarbon mixing ratio mean gradients within the canopy, with highest gas levels within the forest crown responding to strong emissions. The forest emitted monoterpenes, resulting in a total sum exceeding one parts per billion (ppb). Ozone levels ranged from 5 to 10 ppb. Such low ozone mixing ratios can be attributed to the frequent presence of clouds and precipitation. However, following the passage of mesoscale convective storms, ozone levels abruptly increased in response to downward transport from aloft and reached maximum levels of 30 ppb. Photochemical process remained suppressed and resulted in low particle concentrations (<104 particles cm-3), dominated by small diameter (< 400 nanometers) particles. Oxidants remained at sufficient levels to allow reactions of the locally produced hydrocarbons to generate particles. One conclusion is that the rainforest produces necessary and sufficient precursors to form particles.",

            "abstract": "The Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP; Swada, et al., 2002) has been used by a trained team of On the Cutting Edge (CE) observers to characterize the degree of student-centered teaching in US college and university geoscience classrooms. Total RTOP scores are derived from scores on 25 rubric items used to characterize teaching practices in categories of lesson design, content delivery, student-instructor and student-student interactions. More than 200 classroom observations have been completed by the RTOP team in undergraduate courses at a variety of US institution types (e.g., community colleges, research universities). A balanced mix of early career, mid-career, and veteran faculty are included, and the study examines class sizes ranging from small (<30) to large (>80 students). Observations are limited to one class session and do not include laboratories or field activities. Data include RTOP scores determined by a trained observer during the classroom observation and an online survey in which the observed instructors report on their teaching practices. RTOP scores indicate that the observed geoscience classes feature varying degrees of student-centered teaching, with 30% of observed classes categorized as teacher-centered (RTOP scores ≤30), 45% of observed classes categorized as transitional classrooms (RTOP scores 31-49) and 25% are student-centered (RTOP scores ≥ 50). Instructor self-report survey data and RTOP scores indicate that geoscience faculty who have participated in one or more CE professional development event and use the CE website have an average RTOP score of 49, which is significantly higher (> 15 points) than the average score of faculty who have not participated in CE events and have not used the website. Approximately 60% of student-centered classes (those with high RTOP scores) use some traditional lecture nearly every day, but are also are likely to include an in-class activity or group discussion (e.g. Think-Pair-Share). More than 50% of instructors in student-centered classes report spending 30% or less of their class time on such activities (e.g. ≤ 15 minutes of a 50 minute class period), indicating that a relatively small investment can yield important impacts in engaging undergraduate geoscience students.",

            "abstract": "Microbially mediated sulfate reduction is a ubiquitous process in many subsurface systems. Isotopic fractionation is characteristic of this anaerobic process, since sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) favor the reduction of the lighter sulfate isotopologue (S32O42-) over the heavier isotopologue (S34O42-). Detection of isotopic shifts have been utilized as a proxy for the onset of sulfate reduction in subsurface systems such as oil reservoirs and aquifers undergoing uranium bioremediation. Reactive transport modeling (RTM) of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation has been applied to field and laboratory studies. These RTM approaches employ different mathematical formulations in the representation of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation. In order to test the various formulations, we propose a benchmark problem set for the simulation of kinetic sulfur isotope fractionation during microbially mediated sulfate reduction. The benchmark problem set is comprised of four problem levels and is based on a recent laboratory column experimental study of sulfur isotope fractionation. Pertinent processes impacting sulfur isotopic composition such as microbial sulfate reduction and dispersion are included in the problem set. To date, participating RTM codes are: CRUNCHTOPE, TOUGHREACT, MIN3P and THE GEOCHEMIST’S WORKBENCH. Preliminary results from various codes show reasonable agreement for the problem levels simulating sulfur isotope fractionation in 1D.",

            "abstract": "The idea of using a high intensity electron beam to actively probe magnetic field line connectivity in space has been discussed since the 1970’s. However, its experimental realization onboard a magnetospheric spacecraft has never been accomplished because of serious spacecraft charging concerns. Unlike the case of beam experiments in the ionosphere, the tenuous magnetospheric plasma cannot provide the return current necessary to keep the spacecraft charging under control and alternative pathways must therefore be sought. One such pathway is the concept in which a high density contactor plasma emitted prior to the electron beam is used to aid beam emission.\nIn this work, we perform Particle-In-Cell simulations to investigate the conditions under which a high intensity electron beam can be emitted from a magnetospheric spacecraft. First, we show that the electron beam cannot simply be compensated for by an ion beam of equal current, because the Child-Langmuir law is easily violated under conditions of interest. Second, we study the release of a contactor neutral plasma before beam emission and show that the presence of the contactor plasma allows beam emission for longer times. This is consistent with a simple picture where the capacitance of the system consisting of the spacecraft and the ion contactor cloud is increased, as is the time necessary for the spacecraft to charge to the beam kinetic energy and call the beam back. Last, we perform simulations where both the electron beam and the contactor plasma are emitted simultaneously. We show that, after an initial transient controlled by the size of the initial contactor cloud, where the spacecraft potential rises, the spacecraft potential can settle into conditions that allow for electron beam emission. A physical explanation of this result is presented and its implications for beam experiments in space are discussed.",

            "abstract": "CF3CClH2 (HCFC-133a) was recently detected in the atmosphere and its atmospheric mixing ratio has quadrupled over the last 10 years. As expected for this class of compound, HCFC-133a is both an ozone-depleting substance and a greenhouse gas. Precise knowledge of its atmospheric degradation and radiative efficiency is critical to understanding its effect upon the atmosphere. The predominant atmospheric loss process for HCFC-133a is via reaction with the OH radical, where the rate coefficient for this reaction is poorly constrained, especially below room temperature. UV photolysis is a minor loss process, although large discrepancies exist among the reported spectrum measurements. The infrared spectrum of HCFC-133a is presently not available in the literature. The primary focus of this work was to reduce the uncertainties in the atmospheric loss processes of HCFC-133a and its radiative efficiency. Rate coefficient measurements for the OH + HCFC-133a reaction over the temperature range 233–397 K will be reported. In addition, UV absorption spectrum measurements over the wavelength (184.95–240 nm) and temperature (213–323 K) ranges and infrared absorption measurements from 500–4000 cm-1 will be reported. These results are used in 2-D atmospheric model calculations to quantify the atmospheric loss processes, atmospheric lifetime, ozone depletion potential, radiative efficiency, and global warming potential of HCFC-133a. These important metrics will enable informed policy decisions regarding HCFC-133a.",

The processes governing changes in O2 supply and demand are spatially heterogeneous and involve multiple time scales, leading to complex pattern of O2 variability. We present an analysis of model simulations, historical observations, and the recent sedimentary record that reveal fundamental differences between the O2 response of the tropics and high latitudes to rising greenhouse gases. Whereas the reduction in O2 solubility and a slowing of ocean circulation act in concert to deoxygenate the mid- and high-latitudes, these processes tend to counteract one another in the tropics. Emerging evidence from the sedimentary record and model reconstructions in the Pacific Ocean indicates that oxygen demand is the dominant control on oxygenation in the eastern tropical anoxic zones on decadal to centennial time scales. This reduction is closely linked to the strength of the tropical trade winds and upwelling, providing a mechanism for transient contraction of anoxia during climate warming.",

The predictions of the best-fit GIA model indicate respective peak ice thicknesses west and east of Hudson Bay of 3.4-3.6 km and approximately 4 km. These values represent, respectively, a large decrease, and a moderate increase, to the load thickness compared to ICE-5G. This result is generally consistent with other GIA studies focussing on space-geodetic constraints. The large reduction to the ice load west of Hudson Bay also reduces the vertical mantle response along the margins of the load centre, which improves the fit to relative sea-level data from the southern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The fit of GIA model predictions to relative sea-level data from the Baffin Sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet indicate peak ice thicknesses there of 1.2-1.3 km, a modest reduction compared to ICE-5G. On Baffin Island, the modelled elastic crustal response of the Earth to present-day ice mass changes is large. Accounting for this effect improves the agreement between GPS measurements of vertical crustal motion and the GIA model predictions. However, work is needed to incorporate more detailed observations and modelling of present-day changes to glaciers and ice caps. Overall, the fit to the data is most strongly improved in the region west of Hudson Bay (the χ2 RSL misfit is reduced by a factor of ~4) although the entire revised reconstruction for the central and northern Laurentide Ice Sheet provides an improved fit to both the regional RSL data (the cumulative χ2 misfit is reduced by a factor of >2) and the GPS data (the RMS misfit is reduced by a factor of 9).",

The subsidence was recorded by using 13 borehole extensometers and 76 GPS antennas. Four of the GPS antennas are mounted on the deep-anchored (549, 591, 661 and 936 m below the land surface) inner pipes of borehole extensometers. They are located at approximately the same depth as the bottom of Evangeline aquifer. There are two pairs of closely-spaced ( about 100 m) extensometers. They were completed at different depths and show the variation of compaction rate in depth. We conclude that recent subsidence (1993-2012) in the Houston-Galveston area was dominated by the compaction of sediments within 600 m below the land surface. Deep-anchored GPS data shows stable vertical movement indicating no measurable compaction at the depth of the Jasper aquifer or within deeper strata. Depending on the location of specific sites, the compaction could occur from a depth as shallow as that within the Chicot aquifer to the maximum depth at the middle of the Evangeline aquifer. ",

            "abstract": "Three years ago we embarked on a project to boost the coverage of palaeosecular variation data from the Southwest Pacific region, and so to provide the means to enhance global and regional field models, dating tools derived from them, and understanding of features of the geodynamo, particularly beneath this region of the Earth’s surface. Here we present our progress to date, including lake sediment records covering the entire Holocene, archaeomagnetic data from Maori cooking (“hangi”) stones dating back to the earliest occupation of New Zealand, archaeointensities from Lapita pottery from the Pacific Islands (Fiji, Tonga and Papua New Guinea) dating back to ca 3000 BP, and palaeomagnetic directions and intensities from volcanic rocks and lava flows of the North Island of New Zealand. Central to the project is a composite lake sediment record, constrained by a high-resolution radiocarbon-based chronology, which provides a complete record of declination, inclination and relative palaeointensity for New Zealand through the Holocene. This is complemented by directions and absolute intensities from archaeological materials, most of which have associated radiocarbon age control, and lavas with 40Ar-39Ar age constraints, the rock magnetism and analytical details of which are discussed in accompanying posters. The overall picture reveals several large amplitude directional swings in the early Holocene magnetic field, followed by relatively low amplitude secular variation for several thousand years leading to the present trend to increasingly easterly declination and steep inclination as the south magnetic pole moves further off the Antarctic continent towards New Zealand.",

            "abstract": "Rural lands increasingly are receiving attention for the ecosystem services they provide to growing populations. Among the most important of these is water yield and storage in rangelands. Yet rangelands are dynamic, with large land use/land cover changes over time. Uncertainty remains about the effects of these changes on rangeland function and how they affect potential benefits to populations that depend on them. We investigated rangelands in central Texas, USA to quantify changes in land cover and land use and resulting trends in sediment yield over time. Examining eight watersheds totaling 230 km2, we classified land cover using aerial photos from the late 1930s to 2012, focusing on woody plant cover. In addition, we digitized cultivated areas over time. Finally, we collected sediment cores from reservoirs at the base of each watershed and created a chronosequence of sedimentation trends using cesium-137 and lead-210 tracers. Cropland exhibited major reductions nearing 80% in all areas. Woody plant cover trends varied geographically, from steady decreases to decline followed by rebound to consistent increases in shrub extent. Cesium-137 profiles indicated sedimentation rates generally have decreased by more than 50% since 1963. Since then, rates in all areas have been quite stable. Cesium-137 and lead-210 rate estimates were similar (p = 0.69). At its peak, sedimentation in the smaller, semi-urban watershed occurred 1400% faster per unit area than in rural watersheds. Results indicate changing shrub cover is not a primary driver of sediment dynamics in these watersheds. Rather, it is likely that a combination of severe drought and land use history is responsible for periods of high sediment yield and reservoir storage loss",

            "abstract": "Global and regional changes in climate have important implications for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies, for example, have revealed significant warming of inland water bodies throughout the world. To better understand the global patterns, physical mechanisms, and ecological implications of lake warming, an initiative known as the \"Global Lake Temperature Collaboration\" (GLTC) was started in 2010, with the objective of compiling and analyzing lake temperature data from numerous satellite and in situ records dating back at least 20-30 years. The GLTC project has now assembled data from over 300 lakes, with some in situ records extending back more than 100 years. Here, we present an analysis of the long-term warming trends, interdecadal variability, and a direct comparison between in situ and remotely sensed lake surface temperature for the 3-month summer period July-September (January-March for some lakes). The overall results show consistent, long-term trends of increasing summer-mean lake surface temperature across most but not all sites. Lakes with especially long records show accelerated warming in the most recent two to three decades, with almost half of the lakes warming at rates in excess of 0.5 °C per decade during the period 1985-2009, and a few even exceeding 1.0 °C per decade. Both satellite and in situ data show a similar distribution of warming trends, and a direct comparison at lake sites that have both types of data reveals a close correspondence in mean summer water temperature, interannual variability, and long-term trends. Finally, we examine standardized lake surface temperature anomalies across the full 100-year period (1910-2009), and in conjunction with similar timeseries of air temperature. The results reveal a close correspondence between summer air temperature and lake surface temperature on interannual and interdecadal timescales, but with many lakes warming more rapidly than the ambient air temperature over 25- to 100-year periods.",

            "abstract": "Summertime low cloud intrusion into the terrestrial west coast of North America impacts human, ecological, and logistical systems. Over a broad region of the West Coast, summer (May – September) coastal low cloudiness (CLC) varies coherently on interannual to interdecadal timescales and has been found to be organized by North Pacific sea surface temperature. Broad-scale studies of low stratiform cloudiness over ocean basins also find that the season of maximum low stratus corresponds to the season of maximum lower tropospheric stability (LTS) or estimated inversion strength. We utilize a 18-summer record of CLC derived from NASA/NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) at 4km resolution over California (CA) to make a more nuanced spatial and temporal examination of intra-summer variability in CLC and its drivers. We find that uniform spatial coherency over CA is not apparent for intra-summer variability in CLC. On monthly to daily timescales, at least two distinct subregions of coastal California (CA) can be identified, where relationships between meteorology and stratus variability appear to change throughout summer in each subregion. While north of Point Conception and offshore the timing of maximum CLC is closely coincident with maximum LTS, in the Southern CA Bight and northern Baja region, maximum CLC occurs up to about a month before maximum LTS. It appears that summertime CLC in this southern region is not as strongly related as in the northern region to LTS. In particular, although the relationship is strong in May and June, starting in July the daily relationship between LTS and CLC in the south begins to deteriorate. Preliminary results indicate a moderate association between decreased CLC in the south and increased precipitable water content above 850 hPa on daily time scales beginning in July. Relationships between daily CLC variability and meteorological variables including winds, inland temperatures, relative humidity, and geopotential heights within and above the marine boundary layer are investigated and dissected by month, CA subregion, and cloud height. The rich spatial detail of the satellite derived CLC record is utilized to examine the propagation in time and space of CLC on synoptic scales within and among subregions.",

            "abstract": "Sinabung is a 2460 m high andesitic volcano located in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. Sinabung had no confirmed historical activity until a small (VEI 2) explosive eruption in August-September 2010. In September 2013, explosions began again and were accompanied by lava dome growth and subsequent dome-collapse generated pyroclastic flows (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network 35:07; 39:01). The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (Indonesia) estimated dome growth at 3.5 m3/s in late December 2013. From January to March 2014 lava extrusion continued and formed a lobe down Sinabung’s south flank. As of this writing, effusion and growth of the lava lobe continues, but at a much slower rate. Pyroclastic flows generated by collapse of the steep sides of the lobe remain a hazard. We use thermal infrared (TIR) images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomter (MODIS) to observe volcanic activity at Sinabung during the 2013-2014 eruption and estimate effusion rates following the methods of Harris & Ripepe (2007, Geophys. Res. Let. 34). We also use new analysis of those thermal images to characterize style of activity, distinguishing pyroclastic flow activity from pure lava lobe growth. Preliminary results from satellite images show an average effusion rate of 1.1 m3/s during January-March 2014, with peak effusion rates from individual TIR images of 4-7 m3/s in mid-January. These numbers are in good agreement with the ground-based estimates, and they provide improved temporal resolution of the activity as it evolved. Since March, effusion rates have decreased to below 0.01 m3/s on average. Using the MODIS images, we estimate the maximum possible total erupted volume to be 7 million m3, and have constrained the accuracy of this estimate using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry from ground-based visual images of the lava lobe. Following explosions in 2010 and 2013 and high effusion rates from January to March 2014, the ongoing slow effusion suggests a steady-state, open vent system has been established.",

            "abstract": "An application of the 3D elastic full-waveform inversion (FWI) to wide-aperture seismic data obtained for a complex geological setting is presented. Imaging is implemented in the Fourier domain, exploiting damped wave fields. The modeling part is solved with a finite-difference method. The non-linear conjugate gradient method is used for the inverse problem solution. The nonlinearity of FWI leads to the presence of local and multiple minima in the least-squares error functional especially for large offset problems. That leads to the shutdown of the inverse problem convergence and uncertainty in the solution. An accurate starting velocity model can avoid this problem, but in many cases may not be available. Hence other strategies are necessary to address the problem.\nWe propose a robust inversion process for an arbitrary starting velocity model, which allows avoiding local minima and obtaining acceptable images of the deep seated structures defined by large offset data. We proceed from the assumption that decreasing data offset reduces local minima problems but decreases the depth of the recovered image. So, the inversion process is realized sequentially from small to large offsets, allowing recovery of geological structures over the entire depth range of interest from the near surface to deeper depths sensed only by large aperture offsets. Increasing of data offset is first performed at the lowest frequency and then proceeding with treatment of all data offsets from low to high frequencies. A reverse loop is also implemented in the laddering of frequencies, where after the inversion at high frequencies and all offsets we return to the lower frequencies data to continue the IP. Returning to lower frequency data provides helping to ameliorate multiple minima encountered in the inversion. The inversion then concludes by sweeping over higher frequency data, at all offsets.\nWe demonstrate our strategies for treating wide aperture offset data on the Marmousi model, using a linearly increasing starting velocity model with depth. Our results suggest that FWI exploiting variable data offsets, up to 10 km, can be applied successfully to frequencies up to 6 Hz, and it is possible to develop accurate 3D velocity images down to depths of 3.5 km at the resolution that approaches half the smallest wavelength utilized in FWI.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater in irrigated regions is impacted by timing and rates of deep drainage. Because field monitoring of deep drainage is often cost prohibitive, numerical soil water models are frequently the main method of estimation. Unfortunately, few studies have quantified the relative importance of likely error sources. In this study, three potential error sources are considered within a Monte Carlo framework: water retention parameters, rooting depth, and irrigation practice. Error distributions for water retention parameters were determined by 1) laboratory hydraulic measurements and 2) pedotransfer functions. Error distributions for rooting depth were developed from literature values. Three irrigation scheduling regimes were considered: one representing pre-scheduled irrigation ignoring preceding rainfall, one representing pre-scheduled irrigation that was altered based on preceding rainfall, and one representing algorithmic irrigation scheduling informed by profile matric potential sensors. This approach was applied to an experimental site in Nebraska with silt loam soils and irrigated corn for 2002-2012. Results are based on Six Monte-Carlo simulations, each consisting of 1000 Hydrus 1D simulations at daily timesteps, facilitated by parallelization on a 12-node computing cluster.\nResults indicate greater sensitivity to irrigation regime than to hydraulic or vegetation parameters (median values for prescheduled irrigation, prescheduled irrigation altered by rainfall, and algorithmic irrigation were 310 ,100, and 110 mm/yr, respectively). Error ranges were up to 700% higher for pedotransfer functions than for laboratory-measured hydraulic functions. Deep drainage was negatively correlated with alpha and maximum root zone depth and, for some scenarios, positively correlated with n. The relative importance of error sources differed amongst the irrigation scenarios because of nonlinearities amongst parameter values, profile wetness, and deep drainage. Compared to pre-scheduled irrigation, the algorithmic irrigation resulted in a drier profile, higher sensitivity to rooting depth, and lower sensitivity to hydraulic parameters. Results highlight that knowledge of irrigation rates and timing are at least as important as biophysical measurements for constraining recharge.",

Currently, the interaction with lower-band chorus waves at the magnetic equator is the most favored candidate for explaining energetic electron precipitation and the resulting auroral emissions. In an attempt to discern the requirements for electron precipitation, we use conjugate, high-time resolution, time domain recordings from Van Allen Probes and the Canadian array of all-sky imagers.

            "abstract": "Impacts on the lunar surface from meteoroid streams encountered by the Earth-Moon system can result in measurable enhancements in both the lunar atmosphere and dust environment. Here we describe the annual meteoroid streams incident at the Moon during the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, and discuss their effects on the lunar environment. The LADEE science payload consisted of three instruments: the Ultraviolet/Visible Spectrometer (UVS); the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX); and the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS). All three instruments detected the effects of encounters with meteoroid streams. During its time in lunar orbit, the LADEE mission coincided with 18 out of 35 IAU established annual streams. As stream meteoroids move on near-parallel trajectories we expect to observe asymmetries in their effects on the lunar environment. Based on predicted incident meteoroid mass fluxes at the Moon, one might expect the Geminids and Quadrantids to have had the most significant effect on the lunar environment during the mission. While a substantial exospheric response was clearly observed by the LADEE instruments during the Geminids, the apparent response during the Quadrantids was more subdued. One contribution to this difference was likely due to the location of the stream radiant on the lunar surface relative to LADEE’s orbit. The Geminids radiant was predicted to be very close to LADEE’s equatorial orbit, whereas the Quadrantids radiant was much farther poleward. This could explain the diminished exospheric activity and suggests that the response of the lunar environment to meteoroid streams could be relatively localized in some instances. Both short-term and long-term variations observed in the lunar sodium exosphere could be attributed to the instantaneous and cumulative effects of meteoroid stream bombardment. These and other effects will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the flow of fines, particulate sorting in porous media and fractured media during sediment transport is significant for industrial, environmental, geotechnical and petroleum technologies to name a few. For example, the safety of dam structures requires the characterization of the granular filter ability to capture fine-soil particles and prevent erosion failure in the event of an interfacial dislocation. Granular filters are one of the most important protective design elements of large embankment dams. In case of cracking and erosion, if the filter is capable of retaining the eroded fine particles, then the crack will seal and the dam safety will be ensured. Here we develop and apply a numerical tool to thoroughly investigate the migration of fines in granular filters at the grain scale. The numerical code solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and uses a Lagrange multiplier technique. The numerical code is validated to experiments conducted at the USACE and ERDC. These laboratory experiments on soil transport and trapping in granular media are performed in constant-head flow chamber filled with the filter media. Numerical solutions are compared to experimentally measured flow rates, pressure changes and base particle distributions in the filter layer and show good qualitative and quantitative agreement. To further the understanding of the soil transport in granular filters, we investigated the sensitivity of the particle clogging mechanism to various parameters such as particle size ratio, the magnitude of hydraulic gradient, particle concentration, and grain-to-grain contact properties. We found that for intermediate particle size ratios, the high flow rates and low friction lead to deeper intrusion (or erosion) depths. We also found that the damage tends to be shallower and less severe with decreasing flow rate, increasing friction and concentration of suspended particles. We have extended these results to more realistic heterogeneous population particulates for sediment transport.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the US DOE by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 and was sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean, on a volume basis, receives the largest input of terrestrial organic matter of all ocean basins. These inputs come from the most important stock of soil organic carbon (OC) on Earth, estimated around 1700 Pg OC, which is well preserved in permafrost (from patchy to continuous). Arctic watersheds are experiencing unprecedented climate warming, and future warming is projected to be stronger at high latitudes. As a result, we can expect an increase in active layer depth and a decrease of permafrost extent in the near future. These shifts will affect the riverine contributions of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal and oceanic carbon pools. Until recently, few data existed about dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in Siberian rivers, particularly during the spring freshet. Further, there is still a dearth of information about the source and degradation state of this DOC in Arctic rivers through their hydrographs. To address this issue, we intensively sampled two spring flood periods in a small Canadian river (Great Whale river) and the largest Arctic river (Yenisei) at their outlet in order to get information on the source and state (“freshness”) of mobilized DOC during these active flood periods. Combining geographical information data (GIS) and biogeochemical analysis (elemental, isotopic and molecular) we were able to discern dynamic ecosystem linkages. DOC concentration increased 4-9 fold in each river from low flow to peak flow. Molecular characteristics of this DOC are extremely variable during the flood event, ranging from old, altered DOC to fresh, labile DOC. We observed a partition of this quality between DOC and POC, with fresher DOC coming mostly from the leaching of softwoods during peak flow. Snow cover is variable along the period with snow-free area of the watershed imparting the greatest influence on DOC composition within the river. These results confirm that DOC dynamics during the spring flood are complex and much different than during low flow conditions. As export of DOC in this period can reach up to 80% of annual DOC export, measurements acquired during this study will bring crucial information on not only watershed-aquatic system linkages, but also on global carbon cycling.",

            "abstract": "During one 17 month period ending October 2013, three major reports on sea level rise from three highly respected science providers produced three differing, in some cases wildly divergent, estimates of sea level rise through the year 2100. These reports, by the National Research Council, the IPCC, and the National Climate Assessment, collectively flummoxed the lay reader seeking direction on sea level rise projections to incorporate into adaptation planning. Guidance documents soon emerged from state entities, including regulatory agencies, which caused further confusion.\nThe City and County of San Francisco, surrounded by water on three sides, began developing City-wide sea level rise guidance in 2013. A Sea Level Rise Committee featuring representatives of key infrastructure managers met over a nine month period, and their work included an in-depth review of the science of sea level rise. To convert divergent scientific reports into “actionable science” required not only a close reading of each but extensive expert elicitation to tease out the meaning behind each of the numbers and the associated uncertainties. In the end, sufficient consistency between the differing projections, fortified by political exigencies, allowed a “scientific consensus” with actionable science value for the City to surface. The resulting document, “Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco,” begins by providing a scientific underpinning for planning, guidelines for incorporating uncertainty – particularly for accommodating multiple projections for any particular time slice – and outlines a four step process for assessment and adaptation. It also relies on new state-of-the-art inundation maps produced as part of the SFPUC’s capital improvement program. Together, the Guidance and associated tools provide a road map for successful assessment and adaptation to sea level rise. We will also draw lessons from the experience that may be of value to science leaders seeking to make contributions in the decision making domain.",

            "abstract": "From the point of infiltration to the point of discharge, the chemical signature imparted to fluid flowing through catchments represents the weathering flux from the landscape. The magnitude of this flux is linked to both the time water spends in the system and the time required for reactions to influence fluid chemistry. The ratio of these characteristic times is often represented as a Damköhler number (Da), which links the parameters governing reactivity and flow. Stable isotope ratios are now commonly applied to identify and even quantify the processes and rates of primary mineral weathering, secondary mineral formation and biogeochemical cycling within catchments. Here, we derive a series of fractionation-discharge relationships for a variety of governing chemical rate laws utilizing Da coefficients. These equations can be used to isolate and quantify the effects of (1) fluid travel time distributions and (2) chemical weathering efficiency on observed stable isotope ratios. The analytical solutions are verified against multi-component reactive transport simulations of stable isotope fractionation in homogeneous and spatially correlated heterogeneous flow fields using the CrunchTope code and evaluated against field observations.\nWe demonstrate that for an irreversible reaction, the relationship between stable isotope enrichment and reactant concentration obeys a Rayleigh-type model across a wide range of reaction rates. However, this relationship is violated when a heterogeneous travel time distribution is considered. This observation highlights an important discrepancy in the commonly assumed relationship between fractionation and concentration for irreversible reactions. We further extend our derivation to consider isotope fractionation associated with a reversible reaction (i.e. a kinetically controlled approach to equilibrium) in a steady-state flow field. Due to the dependence of the observed isotope ratio on the flow rate, kinetic enrichment and equilibrium fractionation, our results suggest that a simple concentration – fractionation relationship does not exist for this type of reaction.",

            "abstract": "Changes in sea-ice cover, coastal erosion, and freshwater run-off have the potential to greatly influence carbon assimilation pathways and affect trophic structure in benthic communities across the western Arctic. In the Chukchi Sea, variations in the duration and timing of ice cover affect the delivery of ice algae to a relatively shallow (40-50 m) shelf benthos. Although ice algae are known as an important spring carbon subsidy for marine benthic fauna, ice algal contributions may also help initiate productivity of an active microphytobenthos. Recent studies provide clear evidence that the microphytobenthos are photosynthetically active, and have sufficient light and nutrients for in situ growth. The assimilation of benthic diatoms from both sources may explain the 13C enrichment observed in benthic primary consumers throughout the northern Chukchi. On the eastern Beaufort Sea coast, shallow (2-4 m) estuarine lagoon systems receive massive subsidies of terrestrial carbon that is assimilated by a benthic fauna of significant importance to upper trophic level species, but again, distinct 13C enrichment in benthic primary consumers suggests the existence of an uncharacterized food source. Since ice algae are absent, we believe the 13C enrichment in benthic fauna is caused by the assimilation of benthic microalgae, as reflected in seasonally high benthic chlorophyll in spring under replete light and nutrient conditions. Our observations suggest that changes in ice cover, on both temporal and spatial scales, are likely to have significant effects on the magnitude and timing of organic matter delivery to both shelf and nearshore systems, and that locally produced organic matter may become an increasingly important carbon subsidy that affects trophic assimilation and secondary ecosystem productivity.",

            "abstract": "Marine sediments often exhibit strong redox gradients, hosting a range of important nitrogen transformation processes. While the interplay among these microbially catalyzed nitrogen transformations has been well studied in the water column, the sharp redox transition in sediments often makes it far more difficult to unravel the complexity underpinning the cycling of nitrogen. Although often low in concentration, nitrite represents an important ‘crossroad’ in the nitrogen cycle as a reactive intermediate of both reductive and oxidative N transformations, including nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and denitrification. Here we focus on the dual isotopic composition of nitrite (δ15N and δ18O), in concert with nitrate and ammonium data, as a means for constraining the sedimentary N cycling.\nIntact flow-through core incubations were performed on sediments collected from intertidal flats on the island of Sylt, Germany. Three types of substrate (i.e., sand, silt, and clay) were collected and subjected to different oxygen (i.e., ambient vs depleted) and nitrogen (i.e., ambient vs highly loaded) regimes. In addition to the measurement of natural abundance N and O stable isotopes, we also amended cores with nitrate having a positive ∆17O in our high nitrogen treatment, which offers yet an additional tracer to further constrain these transformations.\nWhile the concentration and isotopic composition (δ15N and δ18O) of nitrite act to integrate the influence of major N redox reactions, the N and O isotope systematics are decoupled. Although nitrogen atoms are generally conserved among these transformations, oxygen isotopes of nitrite are subject to a different set of processes. For example, the loss of an oxygen atom during the reductive processes of NO3- and NO2- reduction, the gain of oxygen atoms from O2 and water during nitrification, and oxygen isotopic equilibration between nitrite and water are all reflected in the δ18O of NO2-. Thus, the δ15N, δ18O and Δ17O can be used together to help elucidate the interconnections between the cycling of nitrogen and oxygen. While these sediments were a net source of NO2- to the overlying water, our NO2- isotope data revealed the integrated influence of denitrification, nitrification and oxygen isotope exchange in these dynamic systems.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone (HZ) is a natural bioreactor within streambed sediments. The dynamic interface of streamwater and groundwater creates a diverse microbial community that has potential to provide substantial contaminant removal. However, insufficient water exchange between the stream and the HZ is often a limiting factor for improved streamwater quality. Modular subsurface hydraulic conductivity (K) modifications with the addition of organic carbon substrates have been proposed as a means to increase hyporheic exchange and enhance natural water treatment via denitrification. Subsurface K modification flow paths are well understood from previous computer modeling and tracer testing studies, but treatment capabilities have yet to be tested in physical systems.\nThis research applied chemical and molecular biological techniques to investigate nitrate removal and microbial community structure in a bench-scale stream simulation with subsurface K and carbon modifications. The system received treated wastewater effluent containing soluble nitrogen primarily in the form of nitrate at concentrations fluctuating from 4-7mg/L. To gain insight into denitrification potential and relative microbial activity along hyporheic flow paths, profiles of nitrate fate, total bacterial presence and the density of the denitrification genes (nirS and nirK) were quantified spatially.\nNitrate tests showed a decrease from ~7mg/L in the influent to less than 1mg/L along hyporheic flowpaths. This was accompanied by an increase in 16S rRNA copies (representative of total bacterial biomass) from approximately 200000 gene copies in the influent zone to 630000 gene copies in the effluent zone. Also, the bacterial communities had a greater presence in the upper 6cm of the sediment layer with nirS amplifying 4-5 cycles earlier than nirK in the PCR analysis. The nirS gene concentration was nearly an order of magnitude greater in the effluent zone than the carbon modified zone, suggesting that leached dissolved organic carbon was fueling the process downstream. Our findings show the value of coupled chemical, hydrological and microbial analyses for the optimization of engineered denitrification zones in HZ systems and could further present monitoring tools for assessing environmental performance in situ.",

A VAAC Best Practices group was formed out of these larger meetings and focused on VAAC specific issues of importance. Collaboration was one of the topics under consideration.\nSome ideas and procedures for an effective, yet easy, method for the VAACs to collaborate have been discussed. Implementation has been mainly on a VAAC to VAAC basis, however a more consolidated process needs to be developed and agreed upon between all VAACs in order to successfully move toward harmonization.\nCollaboration procedures and tools are being considered. The National Weather Service (NWS) Alaska Region has been looking at collaborative software to help the VAACs identify the presence of ash and forecast the plume both in the horizontal and vertical. Having an interactive graphical interface within the forecast operation may help to ensure consistency across VAAC boundaries. Existing chat software within NWS is being investigated to allow Tokyo and Anchorage VAAC to “chat” about forecast issues in real time. This capability is being tested through scenarios.\nThe Anchorage and Tokyo VAACs participated in a series of meetings in Tokyo in March 2014. Collaboration was a major topic of discussion. This paper will outline some of the efforts being undertaken between the Anchorage and Tokyo VAACs as a result of these meetings and subsequent dialogue.",

            "abstract": "In the aftermath of the 2010 Chile and 2011 Japan tsunamis that struck the California coastline, emergency managers requested that the state tsunami program provide more detailed information about the flood potential of distant-source tsunamis well ahead of their arrival time. The main issue is that existing tsunami evacuation plans call for evacuation of the predetermined “worst-case” tsunami evacuation zone (typically at a 30- to 50-foot elevation) during any “Warning” level event; the alternative is to not call an evacuation at all. A solution to provide more detailed information for secondary evacuation zones has been the development of tsunami evacuation “playbooks” to plan for tsunami scenarios of various sizes and source locations. To determine a recommended level of evacuation during a distant-source tsunami, an analytical tool has been developed called the “FASTER” approach, an acronym for factors that influence the tsunami flood hazard for a community: Forecast Amplitude, Storm, Tides, Error in forecast, and the Run-up potential. Within the first couple hours after a tsunami is generated, the National Tsunami Warning Center provides tsunami forecast amplitudes and arrival times for approximately 60 coastal locations in California. At the same time, the regional NOAA Weather Forecast Offices in the state calculate the forecasted coastal storm and tidal conditions that will influence tsunami flooding. Providing added conservatism in calculating tsunami flood potential, we include an error factor of 30% for the forecast amplitude, which is based on observed forecast errors during recent events, and a site specific run-up factor which is calculated from the existing state tsunami modeling database. The factors are added together into a cumulative FASTER flood potential value for the first five hours of tsunami activity and used to select the appropriate tsunami phase evacuation “playbook” which is provided to each coastal community shortly after the forecast is provided.",

            "abstract": "Rapid, in-situ methods for identification of biologic and non-biologic mineral precipitation sites permit mapping of biological hot spots. Two portable spectrometers, Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Acoustic-Optic Tunable Filter Reflectance Spectroscopy (AOTFRS) were used to differentiate between bacterially influenced and inorganically precipitated calcite specimens from Fort Stanton Cave, NM, USA. LIBS collects light emitted from the decay of excited electrons in a laser ablation plasma; the spectrum is a chemical fingerprint of the analyte. AOTFRS collects light reflected from the surface of a specimen and provides structural information about the material (i.e., the presence of O-H bonds). These orthogonal data sets provide a rigorous method to determine the origin of calcite in cave deposits. This study used a set of 48 calcite samples collected from Fort Stanton cave. Samples were examined in SEM for the presence of biologic markers; these data were used to separate the samples into biologic and non-biologic groups. Spectra were modeled using the multivariate technique Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Half of the spectra were used to train a PLSR model, in which biologic samples were assigned to the independent variable \"0\" and non-biologic samples were assigned the variable \"1\". Values of the independent variable were calculated for each of the training samples, which were close to 0 for the biologic samples (-0.09 - 0.23) and close to 1 for the non-biologic samples (0.57 - 1.14). A Value of Apparent Distinction (VAD) of 0.55 was used to numerically distinguish between the two groups; any sample with an independent variable value < 0.55 was classified as having a biologic origin; a sample with a value > 0.55 was determined to be non-biologic in origin. After the model was trained, independent variable values for the remaining half of the samples were calculated. Biologic or non-biologic origin was assigned by comparison to the VAD. Using LIBS data alone, the model has a 92% success rate, correctly identifying 23 of 25 samples. Modeling of AOTFRS spectra and the combined LIBS-AOTFRS data set have similar success rates. This study demonstrates that rapid, portable LIBS and AOTFRS instruments can be used to map the spatial distribution of biologic precipitation in caves.",

            "abstract": "Biomineral composition reflects a complex interplay between minute-scale biological control, mineral growth processes, and the influence of environmental conditions. For this reason, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these minerals, as well as the incorporation of trace elements during biomineral growth, are poorly understood. Potential mechanisms governing the production and composition of biominerals can be organized into two distinct groups: a) biological mechanisms controlling the calcifying environment and b) mineral growth processes from this controlled environment. Despite significant advances in both these areas, critical gaps remain in our understanding of biomineral production and geochemical tracer incorporation. We are adapting Atom Probe Tomography (APT), a technique that maps the arrangement and identity of individual atoms within a bulk material, to analyze foraminiferal calcite for the first time. These data-rich atom-scale chemical maps provide a unique opportunity to deconvolve the effects of biological and crystal growth processes in the incorporation of geochemical tracers. \nOur first experiments have examined the influence of the biological-mineral interface on geochemical proxy element incorporation. Preliminary measurements show that (1) we can successfully map impurities in calcite biominerals, while also distinguishing between mineral and organic zones, overcoming a major technical hurdle; and (2) that elements like sodium appear to be recruited to the organic-mineral interface. The high-resolution chemical data from the APT will further allow us to investigate the fundamental basis for geochemical proxy behavior. For example, we can determine for a certain set of conditions whether the substitution of trace elements into the calcite follows ideal solid-solution behavior, as tacitly assumed in many geochemical proxy systems, or is modulated by intra-shell organics, or coupled-substitution interactions. Collectively, the application of APT to biominerals will lead to a mechanistic understanding of the processes controlling proxy behavior, with applications in climate science, geochemistry, and the design of complex biomimetic materials.",

            "abstract": "Nighttime chemical processes of nitrogen oxides, including reactions of the nitrate radical (NO3) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), are important to numerous tropospheric chemical cycles, including the removal of NO­x, the oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons, and the heterogeneous activation of halogen species. These cycles influence regional ozone and aerosol pollution but remain uncertain. Although nitrogen oxide levels are highest in urban areas, nighttime chemistry is notoriously difficult to study in these regions due to surface level buildup of NO and consequent titration of O3, which suppress nighttime chemical reactions. Tai Mo Shan (TMS) is a high elevation site (950 m) situated between the cities of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, each of which has a population of approximately 7 million. Both lie within the Pearl River Delta, a regional megacity of population 45 million. TMS is ideally suited for the study of nighttime chemistry within a megacity because it is situated within the residual boundary layer at night and is influenced by regional pollution in the absence of strong local effects.\nDuring the fall season, the Pearl River Delta region and Hong Kong experience peak ozone due to meteorological pattern that brings polluted continental outflow over the coastal region of southern China. During November and December 2013, a small-scale field study was conducted at the TMS summit to investigate nighttime chemistry. Chemical instrumentation included cavity ring-down and mass spectrometric instruments for NO3, N2O5 and ClNO2, as well as instrumentation for measurement of NOx, NOy, O3, VOCs, aerosols, other trace gases and meteorological data. Regular late afternoon and evening outflow events from mainland China were observed at this site, including one event with extreme (12 ppbv) levels of N2O5. This presentation will give an overview of the campaign, the atmospheric chemical data and its relationship to meteorological regimes. It will also examine budgets for nighttime production and loss of NO3 and N2O5 and the implications for air quality in this region.",

            "abstract": "The Amundsen Sea, Antarctica, has been known for one of the most susceptible region to the current climate change such as sea ice melting and sea surface temperature change. In the Southern Ocean, a predominant amount of primary production is occurring in the continental shelf region. Phytoplankton blooms take place during the austral summer due to the limited sunlit and sea ice cover. Thus, quantifying the variation of summer season net community production (NCP) in the Amundsen Sea is essential to analyze the influence of climate change to the variation of biogeochemical cycle in the Southern Ocean.\nDuring the past three years of 2011, 2012 and 2014 in austral summer, we have conducted underway observations of ΔO2/Ar and derived NCP of the Amundsen Sea. Despite the importance of NCP for understanding biological carbon cycle of the ocean, the observations are rather limited to see the spatio-temporal variation in the Amundsen Sea. Therefore, we applied self-organizing map (SOM) analysis to expand our observed data sets and estimate the NCP during the summer season.\nSOM analysis, a type of artificial neural network, has been proved to be a useful method for extracting and classifying features in geoscience. In oceanography, SOM has applied for the analysis of various properties of the seawater such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, pCO2, and NCP. Especially it is useful to expand a spatial coverage of direct measurements or to estimate properties whose satellite observations are technically or spatially limited.\nIn this study, we estimate summer season NCP and find a variables set which optimally delineates the NCP variation in the Amundsen Sea as well. Moreover, we attempt to analyze the interannual variation of the Amundsen Sea NCP by taking climatological factors into account for the SOM analysis.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent studies demonstrating the importance of rock moisture as a source of water to vegetation, much remains unknown regarding species-specific and seasonal patterns of water uptake in a Mediterranean climate. Here, we use stable isotopes of water (d18O, dD) to define the isotope composition of water throughout the subsurface critical zone of Rivendell, within the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory. We find that a structured heterogeneity of water isotope composition exists in which bulk saprolite is chronically more negative than bulk soil, and tightly held moisture is more negative than the mobile water that recharges the saturated zone and generates runoff. These moisture reservoirs provide a blueprint from which to measure the seasonal uptake patterns of different species collocated on the site. Douglas-firs use unsaturated saprolite and weathered bedrock moisture (i. e. rock moisture) throughout the year. Contrastingly, hardwood species (madrone, live oak, tanoak) modify their source water depending on which moisture is energetically favorable. Hardwoods use freely mobile water in the wet season, and rely on unsaturated zone soil moisture in the dry season. When soil water tension decreases on the drier south-facing slope, hardwood species use saprolite moisture. Although adjacent hardwoods and Douglas-firs partition water based on matric pull on the north side, there is competition for saprolite moisture in late summer on the south side. These results reveal the eco-hydrological importance of moisture derived from weathered bedrock, and show that the hardwoods have a competitive advantage under the drier conditions predicted in many climate models. Finally, the data emphasize that isotope measurements of all subsurface reservoirs and potential water sources are necessary for a complete and accurate characterization of the eco-hydrological processes within the critical zone.",

            "abstract": "Carbon cycling among the three major Earth’s pools, i.e., atmosphere, terrestrial systems and oceans, has received increased attention because the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased significantly in recent years reaching concentrations greater than 400 ppm that have never been recorded before, warming the planet and changing the climate. Within the terrestrial system, soil organic matter (SOM) represents an important sub-pool of carbon. The associations of SOM with soil mineral interfaces and particles, creating micro-aggregates, are believed to regulate the bioavailability of the associated organic carbon by protecting it from transformations and mineralization to carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, the molecular scale interactions of different types of SOM with a variety of soil minerals and the controls on the extent and rate of SOM transformation and mineralization are not well documented in the current literature.\nGiven the importance of SOM fate and persistence in soils and the current knowledge gaps, the application of atomistic scale simulations to study SOM/mineral associations in abiotic model systems offers rich territory for original and impactful science. Molecular modeling and simulation of SOM is a burgeoning and challenging avenue for aiding the characterization of these complex compounds and chemical systems and for studying their interactions in self-assembled aggregates composed of different organic matter compounds and with mineral surfaces of different types and common in soils, which are thought to contribute to their reactive properties including recalcitrance potential and resistance to mineralization.\nHere, we will discuss our large-scale molecular dynamics simulation efforts to explore the interaction of proteins  with clay minerals (i.e., phyllosilicates such as kaolinite, smectite and micas), including the potential physical and chemical structural changes of proteins, protein adsorption by polar and permanently charged mineral surfaces and variably charged edges, and the potential role of amphiphilic proteins in providing adsorptive layers for SOM-mineral interfaces.  Our efforts at characterizing these systems through combined modeling and simulation and NMR will also be discussed.",

The current research extends these findings to explore the role of ice-ash hydrometeor aggregation in various plume environments. Laboratory experiments utilizing an ice nucleation chamber allow us to parameterize tephra aggregation rates under the cold (0 to -50 C) conditions prevalent in the upper regions of volcanic plumes. We consider the interaction of ice-coated tephra of variable thickness grown in a controlled environment. The ice-ash hydrometers interact collisionally and the interaction is recorded by a number of instruments, including high speed video to determine if aggregation occurs. The electric charge on individual particles is examined before and after collision to examine the role of electrostatics in the aggregation process and to examine the charge exchange process. We are able to examine how sticking efficiency is related to both the relative abundance of ice on a particle as well as to the magnitude of the charge carried by the hydrometeor. We here present preliminary results of these experiments, the first to constrain aggregation efficiency of ice-ash hydrometeors, a parameter that will allow tephra dispersion models to use near-real-time meteorological data to better forecast particle residence time in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The spatial distribution of naturally occurring, arsenic-bearing minerals in the subsurface is a key factor for determining the fate and transport of arsenic in groundwater systems. However, the direct measurement and estimation of these heterogeneously distributed minerals are often costly and difficult to obtain. While previous studies have shown the utility of using indirect measurements combined with inverse modeling techniques for tomography of physical properties including hydraulic conductivity, these methods have seldom been used to image geochemical properties. In this study, we use synthetic applications to demonstrate the ability of inverse modeling techniques to image reactive mineral lenses in the subsurface and quantify estimation error using indirect, commonly measured groundwater parameters. Specifically, we simulate the mobilization of arsenic via kinetic oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite due to dissolved oxygen in the ambient groundwater. The modeling investigation is carried out at various scales and considers different flow-through domains including (i) a 1D lab-scale column (80 cm), (ii) a 2D lab-scale setup (30 cm x 60 cm) and (iii) a 2D field-scale domain (4 m x 20 m). Next, the simulated dissolved oxygen data and forward reactive transport model are used to image the spatial distribution of arsenopyrite using the Principal Component Geostatistical Approach (PCGA) for inverse modeling. The PCGA is a matrix-free geostatistical inversion approach that uses the leading principal components of the prior information to save computational costs and can be easily linked with any simulation software. Our results show that the PCGA can be used to image randomly distributed arsenopyrite lenses at various scales and has the potential to be employed at the field-scale to map complex distributions of reactive minerals in the subsurface based on the measurement of dissolved constituents in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "A large wetland and floodplain complex adjacent to the Snake River in southeastern Idaho, USA, encompasses numerous spring-fed creeks that originate on the floodplain and discharge at their confluence with the Snake River and American Falls Reservoir. Resource managers are implementing a program to restore these spring creeks for the recovery of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and ecosystem health. Our objectives were to evaluate the physical characteristics of these spring creeks, develop a conceptual model of their geomorphic function, compare the restoration potential of individual reaches, and communicate our findings to a broad audience of resource managers and regional stakeholders in order to foster restoration planning. A geomorphic assessment along 38 km of three spring creeks was completed by collecting data at several transects within distinct geomorphic reaches, and by collecting data continuously throughout all reaches. These data were summarized in a GIS database and used to quantify the overall geomorphic functioning of each reach. The geomorphic functional scores were scaled from 0% (non-functional) to 100% (fully functional). Among all three spring creeks, geomorphic function ranged from 29% to 63%, with bank conditions and riparian vegetation being the primary causes of overall channel degradation. Results from the geomorphic assessment fostered the development of a conceptual model for spring creek function, whereby degraded bank conditions represent the primary controlling factor of decreased geomorphic function and fish habitat quality. The reach-based geomorphic functional scoring provides an indicator of relative restoration potential for each reach, and is one of the factors used in determining site-specific priorities for protecting, enhancing, and restoring spring creeks on the Fort Hall Bottoms. The study results, conceptual model and restoration strategy were communicated to resource managers and regional stakeholders through a graphically-rich, large format atlas document. Presentation of hard copy and electronic versions of maps and infographics fostered a high level of engagement among those interested in restoring these spring creek systems.",

            "abstract": "The Needles District of Canyonlands, Utah contains a coupled array of extensional faults, salt diapirs and an elongate anticline produced by gravitational stresses associated with erosion and canyon cutting along the Colorado River and its tributaries. Three-dimensional numerical models using high-resolution topography have been produced using FLAC3D to test how plastic flow of evaporites and brittle extension of overburden are coupled during deformation and how they combine to form salt structures in the region. High resolution (50 m DEM) topographic models were built of the Needles District and of the region to the southwest of the Needles containing the Imperial Valley fault. The overburden in these models was described by a strain-softening Mohr-Coulomb rheology and is 400 m thick from the surface to the base of the Colorado River canyon. It overlays a flat, 340 m thick, viscous layer representing the salt, which outcrops in the Colorado river downstream of the grabens. The Needles District is dominated by horst and graben structures which extend updip from the Colorado River to the southeast. In models of the Needles, lateral displacement is dominantly to the northwest, toward the river canyon with the most displacement occurring in regions containing side canyons. In the canyon, salt flows upward to form an anticline that follows the sinuosity of the river, and diapirs appear adjacent to side canyons or where the canyon widens, which is observed in the field and the models. Without a salt layer, models show much smaller displacement rates that vary from northwest to southeast demonstrating the importance of a flat lying salt layer in propagating deformation toward the river. The region to the southwest is an area of broader subsidence bounded by a major fault (Imperial Valley fault) with fewer developed extensional faults near the river canyon. The Imperial Valley fault model shows similar patterns in which deformation is driven perpendicular to the river canyon. However, the sinuosity of the river and side canyons cause displacement direction to shift from north to west. High resolution topographic models demonstrate the sensitivity of salt deformation to topography, influencing both flow direction and displacement rates.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale aggregation of convection has been reported in cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations with relatively small (100-1000km), non-rotating domains. This aggregation is thought to be driven by feedbacks between convection, radiation and tropospheric moisture. It has been suggested that the observed Madden- Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a “moisture mode” driven by physics similar to that of the simulated small-scale aggregation, but alternative theories of the MJO remain viable. Here we show that a super-parameterized global model run with uniform sea surface temperature and no rotation also produces convective aggregation, with a characteristic scale of 2000-5000km. Moisture and moist static energy budgets indicate that the mechanisms driving this large-scale aggregation are similar to those driving aggregation in CRMs. When rotation is added, the model simulates robust MJO activity. A set of mechanism-denial experiments and runs with intermediate rotation are used to link the non-rotating aggregation to the MJO. Implications for MJO theories will be discussed. ",

            "abstract": "Elevated sodium and titanium in pyroxene and spinel with high TiO2 (> 0.2 wt%) are suggested as the geochemical characteristic for the MORB-like melt infiltration of peridotites. The petrological and geochemical results of melt infiltrating in mantle peridotites are controlled by not only the melt composition but also the melt/rock ratio. Large discordant dunite bodies in the mantle transition zone are the direct observation of large volume melt (high melt/rock ratio) infiltrating by channeled porous flow in the shallow mantle (\n1\n). In addition to dunites, melt infiltrating results in a large variety of vein lithologies in mantle, and the occurrence of plagioclases are considered as a petrological signal of melt-reaction at shallow depth (\n2\n,\n3\n) with a medium melt/rock ratio. Because the lacking of obviously petrological and geochemical variation of peridotites, melt infiltration of peridotites with a low melt/rock ratio are rarely reported.\nPeridotites in this study are from the 53° E amagmatic segment at the Southwest Indian Ridge. These peridotites are suggested as highly depleted buoyant mantle drawn up from the asthenosphere beneath southern Africa during the breakup of Gondwanaland (4) and are residues of multi-stage melt extracting in both spinel and garnet field. We present a detailed analysis of mineral compositions by both the EMPA and LA-ICPMS. Mineral phases in 53°E peridotites have mantle major element compositions, although minerals show variations with the crystal size and the location from cores to rims (Fig.1). In conjunction with the profile analysis of large clinopyroxene crystals, our results document the melt infiltration occurred at the ultraslow-spreading environment. At least two kinds of percolation melts are distinguished. They are normally MORB-like melt and ultra-depleted melt.\n",

            "abstract": "Acoustic recordings reveal a variety of volcanic activities during an exceptionally loud vulcanian eruption at Tungurahua. A period of several months of mild surface activity came to an abrupt end with the emission of a powerful blast wave heard at least 180 km away. Sensors 2080 m from the vent recorded a stepped rise to its maximum overpressure of 1220 Pa (corresponding to a sound pressure level of 156 dB) and its unusually long dominant period of 5.6 s. We discuss source processes that produced the blast wave, considering that wave propagation could be nonlinear near the vent because of high overpressures. More than an hour of acoustic activity was recorded after the blast wave, including sound from falling ballistics, reflections of the blast wave from nearby mountains, pyroclastic density currents, and acoustic tremor at the vent. Glitches in the acoustic records related to plume lightning were also serendipitously observed, although thunder could not be unambiguously identified. We discuss acoustic signatures of falling ballistics and pyroclastic density currents and how array-style deployments and analytic methods can be used to reveal them. Placement of sensors high on the volcano's slopes facilitated resolving these distinct processes. This study demonstrates that near-vent, array-style acoustic installations can be used to monitor various types of volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "We present the first measurements of SO2 emissions at Semeru volcano, Indonesia, using an SO2 camera. Activity at Semeru is characterized by quiescent degassing interspersed with short-lived explosive events with low ash burden. The interval between explosions was measured at 32.1±15.7 minutes in a webcam survey of the volcano between the months of June and December 2013. We distinguish between two types of events: shorter events (type I: ~5 mins duration) with emissions returning quickly to baseline levels, and longer events (type II: ~15 mins duration) often showing multiple pulses and a longer period of increased emissions before a return to quiescent levels. Type I events represent >90% of the activity and release an average of 200-450 kg of SO2 per event. The single type II event we documented with the SO2 camera released a total of 1300 kg of SO2. We estimate the daily average emissions of Semeru to be 21-60 t d-1 of SO2, amounting to a yearly output of 7.5-22 Gg (7,500 – 22,000 metric tons), with 35-60% released during explosive events. The time series patterns of degassing are consistent with the existence of a viscous plug at the top of the conduit, causing accumulation and pressurization of the magma to produce the explosive events.",

The NSF-supported Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) Program works with the academic fleet community to routinely document, assess, and preserve the underway sensor data from U.S. research vessels. The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) is an EU-US-Australian collaboration fostering interoperability among regional e-infrastructures through workshops and joint prototype development. The need to align terminology between systems is a common challenge across all of the ODIP prototypes. Five R2R students were supported to address aspects of semantic interoperability within ODIP.\nDeveloping a vocabulary matching service that links terms from different vocabularies with similar concept. The service implements Google Refine reconciliation service interface such that users can leverage Google Refine application as a friendly user interface while linking different vocabulary terms.\nDeveloping Resource Description Framework (RDF) resources that map Shipboard Automated Meteorological Oceanographic System (SAMOS) vocabularies to internationally served vocabularies. Each SAMOS vocabulary term (data parameter and quality control flag) will be described as an RDF resource page. These RDF resources allow for enhanced discoverability and retrieval of SAMOS data by enabling data searches based on parameter.\nImproving data retrieval and interoperability by exposing data and mapped vocabularies using Semantic Web technologies. We have collaborated with ODIP participating organizations in order to build a generalized data model that will be used to populate a SPARQL endpoint in order to provide expressive querying over our data files.\nMapping local and regional vocabularies used by R2R to those used by ODIP partners. This work is described more fully in a companion poster.\nMaking published Linked Data Web developer-friendly with a RESTful service. This goal was achieved by defining a proxy layer on top of the existing SPARQL endpoint that 1) translates HTTP requests into SPARQL queries, and 2) renders the returned results as required by the request sender using content negotiation, suffixes and parameters.",

We analyze the dependence of the shape and location of the ozone distribution on geographic location, emissions and temperature. Depending on these parameters the ozone distribution can be bounded and characterized by a maximum value or it can be unbounded and characterized by a return period. For example, the changes in emissions associated with the EPA SIP call shifts the location of the entire ozone distribution towards lower ozone values and in some locations changes the shape of the distribution from bounded to unbounded.

            "abstract": "There distributed many relatively isolated seamounts in several inferred seamount chains in west Pacific, and the area has been named as west Pacific seamount province (WPSP). Studying on basaltic rocks from the WPSP will be helpful to better understanding the diversity of plume geodymanics and developing the plume theory. Basaltic lavas from eight seamounts in the WPSP have been studied for petrography, major-, trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition. The petrographic characteristics of these rocks show moderately to highly altered. Major element compositions show all of these rocks belong to alkalic series, and some samples lost their alkalis elements during submarine seawater alteration. Primitive mantle normalized spider diagram and chondrite normalized rare earth element distributional pattern show that they were originated from OIB-like source and possibly underwent low degree partial melting. Isotopic characteristics imply that three mantle end-members (DMM, EMI and HIMU) can explain Sr-Nd-Pb compositions of these rocks from the WPSP, i.e., DMM is depleted MORB mantle identical to that being created MORB in EPR, EMI (reprecented by Rarotonga island) is possibly from subducted ancient continental crust, and HIMU (represented by Cook-Austral Islands) is typically originated from recycled oceanic crust. Based on the present study combined with published data, we proposed that the origin of some (maybe all) of seamounts in the WPSP are splash plumes proposed by Davies and Bunge (2006) or smaller plumes branched at the base of lithosphere from the Superwell which has created the Ontong Java plateau.

            "abstract": "European winter storms cause billions of dollars of insured losses every year. Therefore, it is essential to understand potential impacts of future events, and the role reinsurance can play to mitigate the losses. The authors will present an overview on natural catastrophe risk assessment modeling in the reinsurance industry, and the development of a new innovative approach for modeling the risk associated with European winter storms.The new innovative approach includes the development of physically meaningful probabilistic (i.e. simulated) events for European winter storm loss assessment. The meteorological hazard component of the new model is based on cyclone and windstorm tracks identified in the 20thCentury Reanalysis data. The knowledge of the evolution of winter storms both in time and space allows the physically meaningful perturbation of historical event properties (e.g. track, intensity, etc.). The perturbation includes a random element but also takes the local climatology and the evolution of the historical event into account.The low-resolution wind footprints taken from the 20thCentury Reanalysis are processed by a statistical-dynamical downscaling to generate high-resolution footprints for both the simulated and historical events. Downscaling transfer functions are generated using ENSEMBLES regional climate model data.\nThe result is a set of reliable probabilistic events representing thousands of years. The event set is then combined with country and site-specific vulnerability functions and detailed market- or client-specific information to compute annual expected losses.",

            "abstract": "Although it is clear that delta topset surfaces can maintain an average long-term parity between subsidence and sedimentation, the ways in which subsidence information is transmitted to the fluvial system and its effects on the rivers remain unresolved. Here we argue that the direct, local effect of subsidence on river systems is transmitted through spatial gradients in subsidence, and that the overall spatial mean subsidence communicates only indirectly with the river system, through its effect on relative sea level. With this idea in mind, we first express the local spatial variation of subsidence by taking the (vector) gradient of the local (scalar) subsidence rate expressed as a downward speed. This vector field represents the rate and maximum direction of rotation induced by subsidence gradients. We then compare this rotation-vector field to the surface-slope field, and decompose the subsidence-induced surface rotation into slope-normal and slope-parallel components. The slope-normal component is associated with lateral steering of the river channels, tending to direct them towards areas of maximum subsidence. The slope-parallel component acts directly to induce local erosion and deposition by changing the surface slope. The effect of the slope-normal component is also modulated by floodplain deposition and other out-of-channel effects. We apply these ideas to experimental data and to the Holocene Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna (GBJ) Delta, Bangladesh, and compare the resulting predictions to stratigraphic and other observations.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of spatially-variable gravity at the field scale are difficult; measurements of the time-varying field even more so. Every previous gravity survey using relative gravimeters—still the workhorse of gravity studies, despite their nearly 80 year history—has assumed a static gravity field during the course of a survey, which may last days to weeks. With recently-improved instrumentation, however, measurements of fields changing on the order of tens of nm/sec2 per day are now possible. In particular, the A-10 portable absolute gravimeter provides not only absolute control, but also the change in that control during the course of a survey. Using digitally-recording spring-based relative gravimeters (namely, the ZLS Burris meter and the Scintrex CG-5), with their more efficient data collection and lower drift than previous generations, many more data are collected in a day. We demonstrate a method for incorporating in the least-squares network adjustment of relative gravity data a relation between the rate of change of gravity, dg, and distance from an infiltration source, x. This relation accounts for the fact that gravity at stations adjacent to the infiltration source changes more rapidly than stations further away; if all measurements collected over several days are to be included in a single network-adjustment, consideration of this change is required. Two methods are used to simulate the dg(x) relation: a simple model where dg is a linear function of x, and a coupled-hydrogeophysical method where a groundwater flow model predicts the nonlinear spatial variation of dg. Then, the change in gravity between different, independently adjusted surveys is used to parameterize the groundwater model. Data from two recent field examples, an artificial recharge facility near Tucson, Arizona, USA, and from the 2014 Lower Colorado River pulse flow experiment, clearly show the need to account for gravity change during a survey; maximum rates of change for the two studies were up to 30 and 50 nm/sec2 per day, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Seven cruises were conducted in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary and the adjacent western East China Sea (ECS) from 2010 to 2012 to study the seasonal variations of δ13C and δ15N in suspended organic matter. In addition, two cruises in the northeastern ECS in July 2011 and in Tsushima Strait in July 2012 were conducted to evaluate the distribution patterns of these isotopes over the entire Changjiang transport pathway. In summer, the surface δ13C was lowest in the Changjiang Channel, increasing from land to sea, reaching highest values in the central ECS, and then decreasing and remaining relatively constant. In winter, the surface δ13C in the western ECS showed lower values with less variation in general. At most stations, δ13C increased from the sea surface to the seabed, reflecting the degradation of sinking organic matter; however, these trends could be changed in the summer by surface phytoplankton accumulation. Combining data from all the Changjiang Estuary and western ECS cruises revealed that when the suspended particulate matter (SPM) was > 135 mg/L, the δ13C values were fairly constant (–24.5‰ to –20.5‰); when the SPM was < 135 mg/L, the δ13C values showed much greater variability (–28.4‰ to –16.6‰). The surface δ15N also showed generally higher values in the central ECS in summer and lower values in winter. The seasonal variations of δ13C and δ15N were largely attributed to the SPM composition change: i.e., more phytoplankton cells in the summer whereas more resuspended sediment particles were present in winter.",

            "abstract": "The northwest part of India (NWI) known as the “wheat bowl” of the country, receives 40% - 45% of its annual precipitation during winter season. This precipitation is very important for the wheat crop, as it supplements the moisture and maintains low temperature during the reproductive stages. Most of the winter precipitation in the region is in the form of snowfall over western Himalayas. This precipitation, in turn, helps in maintaining the glaciers, which serve as the vast storehouse of freshwater supply to millions of people downstream throughout the year through rivers of western Himalayan origin. Therefore, for a country like India that gets more than 80% of its wheat production and fresh water from NWI region, the question arises whether strategies of winter-time precipitation prediction that have proved useful elsewhere can be adapted to the exceptionally complex terrain of Himalayas as well?\nIt has been found that present day coupled general circulation models (GCMs) provide seasonal-scale prediction in advance, however this prediction is in coarse resolution and skill is not satisfactory even with multi-model ensemble techniques. Thus, it is necessary to reproduce the information of the GCMs at higher resolution with improved skill using downscaling approaches. Therefore ultimate goal of the present study is to use output of the GCMs without statistical correction, and apply this output to regional climate model in a way that allows realistic simulation of precipitation and temperature over NWI. In particular we discuss (a) requirement for assessing the fidelity of the coupled general circulation models, (b) the role of various idealized experiments (for e.g. cumulus schemes, resolution, orography and land surface change) and (c) development of novel statistical downscaling technique for seasonal-scale prediction over NWI. We also highlight the benefits and current issues associated with the proposed \"explicit\" approach.",

            "abstract": "Across many soil types and conditions, soil internal drainage exhibits predictable dynamics that converge to a stable hydration state termed “field capacity” (FC). Notwithstanding the usefulness of this natural state as a hydrologic benchmark for modeling and for estimation of plant available soil water, FC had been fraught with ambiguities and inconsistencies since its inception. We propose using a soil intrinsic characteristic length (derived from drainable soil pore size distribution) to mark conditions for loss of hydraulic continuity linked with attainment of FC. This static criterion for FC was extended to define a general and self-consistent dynamic criterion for internal drainage dynamics. A systematic evaluation of the proposed FC definitions using a numerical model and experimental data reveals remarkable consistency and predictability across a wide range of soil types. The new intrinsic metrics provide the necessary definitiveness for this useful concept relevant to a broad range of agronomic, hydrologic, ecological and climatic applications. The consistency of FC hydration state must have played an important role in shaping life in soil not only in terms of plant available water, but also in the aquatic habitats it defines for soil biota.

            "abstract": "It has been a longstanding challenge in the last few decades to quantitatively reconstruct the paleogeographic evolution of East Eurasia because of its great tectonic complexities. As the core region, the major China cratons including North China Block, South China Block and Tarim Block hold the key clues for the understanding of the amalgamation history, tectonic activities and biological affinity among the component blocks and terranes in East Eurasia. Compared with the major Gondwana and Laurentia plates, however, the apparent polar wander paths of China are not well constrained due to the outdated paleomagnetic database and relatively loose pole selection process. With the recruitment of the new high-fidelity poles published in the last decade, the rejection of the low quality data and the strict implementation of Voo’s grading scheme, we build an updated paleomagnetic database for the three blocks from which three types of apparent polar wander paths (APWP) are computed. Version 1 running mean paths are constructed during the pole selection and compared with those from the previous publications. Version 2 running mean and spline paths with different sliding time windows are computed from the thoroughly examined poles to find the optimal paths with the steady trend, reasonable speed for the polar drift and plate rotation. The spline paths are recommended for the plate reconstructions, however, considering the poor data coverage during certain periods. Our new China APWPs, together with the latest European reference path, the geological, geochronological and biological evidence from the studied Asian plates allow us to reevaluate the paleogeographic and tectonic history of East Eurasia.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we use an ocean model to explore how vertical mixing influences temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEPO). Our approach is to change the background diffusion coefficient from a constant value\nκ\nb\nto\nκ\nb\n+δκ(z)\nin various subregions of the tropical Pacific, and then to determine the resulting temperature changes in the near-equilibrium response. In a companion paper (Furue et al., 2014, submitted), we consider the impacts of depth-independent\nκ\nb\nanomalies. Here, we examine the impacts of depth-dependent anomalies that are confined above, or centered on, the mid-depth of the pycnocline.\nDuring the first year of adjustment, solutions develop a local temperature response that results largely from the one-dimensional balance,\nδ\nT\nt\n=(δκ\nT\nz\n)\nz\n=δ\nκ\nz\nT\nz\n+δκ\nT\nzz\n, with a similar equation for salinity. At this stage,\nδκ\ngenerates temperature and salinity anomalies that are either associated with a density change (dynamical anomalies) or without one (spiciness anomalies). Subsequently, dynamical and spiciness anomalies spread to remote regions by wave radiation and advection, respectively.\nFor positive\nδκ\nanomalies confined above the mid-pycnocline,\nδ\nκ\nz\nT\nz\n(\nδκ\nT\nzz\n) tends to produce positive (negative) temperature anomalies, which spread to the equator dynamically (by wave radiation) and are still apparent in near-equilibrium solutions. For\nδκ\nanomalies confined within the pycnocline (with monopole, dipole, and tripole profiles), the response is dominated by\nδ\nκ\nz\nT\nz\n, owing to\nδκ\nhaving a smaller vertical scale than\nT\nand to\nδκ\nnot overlapping well with\nT\nzz\n; the resulting temperature anomalies tend to shift the pycnocline vertically (dipole profile) or to alter its thickness (monopole and tripole profiles).\nPositive anomalies from all subregions contribute to an increase of near-surface (upper 50 m) temperature in the EEPO, the amplitude and location of the warming depending on the depth range of the warming band generated within the locally forced subregion.",

            "abstract": "Many Proterozoic anorthosite massifs show crustal isotopic signatures that have fuelled debate regarding the source (mantle vs. lower crust) of these temporally restricted magmas. The models advocating a mantle derivation for these rocks suggest that lower crustal assimilation plays an important role in developing the isotopic signature of the massifs, but no evidence exists to support this. We make use of Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions of anorthosites from the Mealy Mountains Intrusive Suite (MMIS), the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS) and the Rogaland Anorthosite Province (RAP), their internal mineral phases and comagmatic, high-pressure pyroxene megacrysts, which represent samples from various stages of the polybaric ascent of the magmas, to probe the origin of the crustal isotopic signatures and assess the importance of differentiation at lower crustal depths. Study of the MMIS and NPS is instructive as each is intruded into crust of significantly different age and isotopic composition. We observe varying degrees of internal isotopic disequilibrium, enforcing the notion that the nature of the crustal assimilant has a profound influence on the chemical signature of the magmas (Fig. 1). We also find unexpected patterns of internal isotopic disequilibrium, such as isotopically depleted orthopyroxene relative to plagioclase (Fig. 1), which suggests that anorthosite petrogenesis is not a “simple” case of progressive crustal contamination during polybaric magma ascent, but is more likely to involve significant differentiation and solidification at lower crust depths. The 100 m.y. magmatic timescales observed in these anorthosite systems may be caused by significant magmatic differentiation at Moho/lower crustal levels, as well as formation in long-lived arc environments. These long-lived magmatic timescales contrast with recent observations suggesting that the duration of magma ascent from the Moho to surface in arc environments is on the order of months to years. Such contrasting timescales for magmatism hint at non-uniformitarian processes at work in the subduction regime (favoring anorthosite production) during the Proterozoic Eon and/or suggests that there may be a continuum of magma ascent rates in arcs with anorthosite ascent rates representing the slowest end of the spectrum.",

It simulates soil moisture in vertically stacked soil layers, as well as exchange to the atmosphere and underlying groundwater reservoir. Fluxes are simulated under different land cover types by considering sub-grid variations in topography, vegetation phenology and soil properties. The model includes physically-based schemes for runoff generation and infiltration, resulting in direct runoff, interflow, groundwater recharge and baseflow, as well as channel routing.\nWe present the latest version of the model, PCR-GLOBWB 2.0, consolidating all new developments introduced since PCR-GLOWB 1.0 was first published (van Beek et al, 2011). The main new components are:\nAn inclusion of water demand module and the progressive \u0007introduction of reservoirs and expansion of irrigation areas (Wada et al, 2014)\nAn attribution of water use to ground- and surface water resources and the fate of return flow (de Graaf et al, 2014)\nA routing scheme accounting for variable extent of floodplains (Winsemius et al, 2013)\nPCR-GLOBWB 2.0 now runs at a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (± 10 km) in comparison to the 30 arc min (50 km) resolution used in PCR-GLOWB 1.0. At the finer resolution and with the added components, PCR-GLOBWB 2.0 shows improvements over the previous version: observed discharges from 5142 GRDC stations can be approximated more closely and model efficiency improves, particularly for smaller catchment areas (ρ = 0.87); human impacts, altering the seasonal and inter-annual variation of terrestrial water storage, are well simulated and evident in the validation to GRACE data (ρ = 0.81). These improvements open up new possibilities to assess the state of global water resources.\nAlso, we show an outlook of model results at higher resolutions: 3 arc min (5 km) and 30 arc sec (1 km) for specific test-bed areas: California, Illinois and Rhine-Meuse. We discuss fundamental challenges in high resolution hydrological modeling and address various issues that range from computational challenges, lack of sufficient detail/fine information for parameterization - including atmospheric forcing - and emergent scaling problems at finer resolution (e.g. lateral exchange due to groundwater flow and water distribution network).",

It was proposed that C4 plants appeared drastically in response to change in hydrological cycle. Subsequently, various workers documented evolution and expansion of C4 plants from different Siwalik sections of India, Nepal and Pakistan. Although evolution and expansion of C4 plants was documented in all these studies but nature and timing of expansion of C4 plants showed variations from section to sections. Even from same section, the results varied with change in proxies. The hydrological changes also differ regionally. One of the reasons of differences in results was lack of modern data set from the Indian subcontinent. For example, in many cases δ18O values of New Delhi rainwater has been considered as reference data set and applied to site of investigation with some corrections. The average δ13C values of C3 and C4 plants was considered as -27‰ and -12.5‰ respectively, but modern C3 plants in the Gangetic plain is almost 2.5‰ lower than the value used in those studies. Additional problem raised as preservation of pristine isotopic character of soil organic matter is also apprehensive. To resolve all these issues, the δ13C value of long chain alkane have been used to reconstruct C3-C4 plants after isotopic characterization of modern plants and their biomarker from the Gangetic plain which is equivalent to the past Siwalik flood plain. Additionally, δD values of long chain alkane were also measured. Variations of d13C values of long chain alkane with time show presence of C4 plants in Siwalik from 11 Ma ago and since then gradual increase in C4 plants till 6 Ma followed by a sharp increase. The statistically significant correlation between δD and δ13C values of long chain alkane show that positive impact of hydrological change on abundance of C3-C4 plants.",

            "abstract": "CO2 is widely considered the key mechanism for translating Northern Hemisphere Milankovitch forcing into globally synchronous glacial-interglacial cycles. A major line of reasoning in support of CO2 is its apparent correlation with tropical SSTs. I reassess this argument with two new Mg/Ca reconstructions from the eastern tropical Pacific stretching back ~230,000 years. These records are combined with previous ones to construct a regional SST composite with unrivaled resolution and data density. Comparison with Antarctic temperature underscores a tight thermal coupling between the two regions down to the details of distinct millennial scale events. Comparison with CO2 on the other hand demonstrates a more complex relationship. I focus here on a large and robust lead of SST over CO2 during the 5e-d transition, implying that CO2 is not the main driver of tropical SST during glacial inception. Based on independent evidence that deep-ocean temperatures also cooled in advance of CO2, I propose an alternative mechanism: the cooling signal originates in the surface North Atlantic from Milankovitch forcing, enters the deep ocean with North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and spreads globally with deep ocean circulation. In the Southern Ocean NADW becomes precursor to Antarctic Intermediate Water and Antarctic Bottom Water transmitting the signal to large volumes of the ocean interior. In the eastern tropical Pacific the signal emerges when Antarctic Intermediate Water upwells to the surface, spreads westward with the large-scale equatorial currents and enters the Indian Ocean with the Indonesian Through Flow, synchronizing the Indo-Pacific tropical SST response. In this view ocean circulation does the “heavy lifting” in globalizing the climatic cooling during glaciation, but CO2 may play a more prominent role during deglaciation, which is dynamically not the reverse process of glaciation.",

            "abstract": "Plutons have long been viewed as crystallized remnants of large magma reservoirs, a concept now challenged by high precision geochronological data coupled with thermal models. Similarly, the classical view of silicic eruptions fed by long-lived magma reservoirs that slowly differentiate between mafic recharges is being questioned by petrological and geophysical studies. In both cases, a key and yet unresolved issue is the rate of magma transfer in the crust. Here, we use thermal analysis of magma transport to calculate the minimum rate of magma transfer through dykes. We find that unless the crust is exceptionally hot the recharge of magma reservoirs requires a magma supply rate of at least ~ 0.01 km3/yr, much higher than the long-term growth rate of plutons, which demonstrates unequivocally that igneous bodies must grow incrementally. This analysis argues also for magma reservoirs being short-lived and erupting rapidly after a recharge of already differentiated magma. These findings have strong implications for the monitoring of dormant volcanic systems, and raise questions on our ability to interpret geodetic surface signals related to incipient eruptions.",

Here, we present textural analysis by neutron diffraction and microstructural and microchemical data on diagonite Yamato 74013. The meteorite is composed mainly of orthopyroxene with inclusions and interstitial grains of troilite and chromite. A coarse grained orthopyroxene – troilite vein transects the sample. Neutron diffraction data shows a distinct crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of the orthopyroxene grains. Such strong CPO is unusual for meteorites such as chondrites and stony meteorites.\nDetailed electron backscatter diffraction analysis confirms that the origin of the preferred orientation is solid state crystal plastic deformation. All phases in the matrix of the rock show crystal plastic deformation, chromite shows distinct substructures, with inclusions of troilite. Orthopyrxone grains are between 50-120 microns in diameter and exhibit irregular interlocking grain boundaries, subgrain boundaries and continuous crystal lattice bending. Grain boundary morphology suggests post-deformation recrystallization with a dominance of grain boundary migration. Orthopyroxene within the vein have traces of S and show straight grain boundaries to each other. Vein troilite grains are interstitial and reach sizes up to 50 times larger than in the matrix.\nOur results suggest that deep in Yamato’s parent body, orthopyroxene is deformed in a crystal plastic regime and experienced significant post-deformational recrystallization. The irregular distribution of interstitial troilite and chromite suggests that segregation of core material has been incipient retaining significant amounts of metal. One possible conclusion is that within small bodies like Vesta, even though deformation and differentiation were concomitant within a dynamic environment, differentiation was not efficient.",

            "abstract": "We have collected a global dataset of several thousands of high quality records of PKPbc, PKPbc-diff and PKPdf phase arrivals in the distance range 149-178 degrees. Within this collection, we have identified an energy packet that arrives 5-20 seconds after the PKPbc (or PKPbc-diff) and represents a coda that is not predicted by 1D reference seismic models. The origin of this scattered energy is unclear and may provide valuable information about structure in the core. We use array analysis techniques to enhance the signal of theses scatterers and try and locate them. \nOur results show that the scattered energy originates along the great-circle path in a consistent range of arrival times and narrow range of ray parameter. There are no obvious variations with source or station location, in particular the depth of the source. After exploration of possible location for these scatterers, we show that their origin is most likely at the base of the outer-core, in the F-layer. \nTo assess our interpretation, we model synthetic seismograms and test velocity profiles in the F-layer. We suggest that such a layer may be responsible for the scattering in the PKP coda as observed in the data. The detection and observation of this scattered energy enables us to constrain physical properties of the F-layer that play an important role in the investigation of the geodynamo modelisation and core evolution.",

            "abstract": "The main hydrological signal in gravity recordings by superconducting gravimeters (SGs) is typically seasonal. At the Metsähovi Geodetic Observatory of the Finnish Geodetic Institute the seasonal signal is up to 8 microgal peak-to-peak. Here we concentrate on the much smaller short-period hydrological signals in the minutes-to-hours range, due to the direct attraction of very close water masses within some hundred meters from the gravity laboratory. This period range is interesting e.g. for SG observations of the gravity signature of deep earth processes, where the signal is very small, and a possible decrease in noise level obtained from hydrological modeling would be useful.\nAround the gravity laboratory at Metsähovi we have installed 12 arrays of soil moisture sensors at depths of 0.1 to 1 m below surface, three borehole wells to groundwater in the fractures of the crystalline bedrock, and 11 observation tubes into groundwater level in sediments, typically at 1 to 4 m depth below surface. Since January 2014 we record the snow water equivalent with a passive gamma ray device. However, a major component in local water mass remains inaccessible to these sensors. From earlier research we know that during summer months, even a major rainfall pulse is quickly removed from the surface layers of the soil by evapotranspiration, and frequently never reaches the depth of the soil moisture sensors; let alone the groundwater. Obviously, this also depends on the prior moisture state of the soil layers. But in any case the water mass is present for a while, and the input pulse is detectable not only by a rain gauge but also by an upward slope in the SG record.\nAt the laboratory we now have three superconducting gravity sensors: the SG T020 has been operating since 1994, and in February 2014 the new SG OSG-073 with two individual sensors was installed at two meters’ distance from the T020. The characteristics of the three sensors are different, and also the different locations influence slightly the gravity signal from variation in local masses. We present first results of the modeling of short-period gravity variation using all hydrological sensors, and compare them with the three SG gravity time series.",

            "abstract": "Using an active source of neutrons as an in situ probe of a planetary body has proven to be a powerful tool to extract information about the presence, abundance, and location of subsurface volatiles without the need for drilling. The Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument on Curiosity is an example of such an instrument and is designed to detect the location and abundance of hydrogen within the top 50 cm of the Martian surface. DAN works by sending a pulse of neutrons towards the ground beneath the rover and detecting the reflected neutrons. The intensity and time of arrival of the reflection depends on the proportion of water, while the time the pulse takes to reach the detector is a function of the depth at which the water is located. Similar instruments can also be effective probes at the polar-regions of the Moon or on asteroids as a way of detecting sequestered volatiles.\nWe present the results of GEANT4 particle simulation models of gamma ray, fast, epithermal, and thermal neutron responses to active neutron illumination. The results are parameterized by hydrogen abundance, stratification and depth of volatile layers, versus the distribution of neutron and gamma ray energy reflections. Models will be presented to approximate Martian, lunar, and asteroid environments and would be useful tools to assess utility for future NASA exploration missions to these types of planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "The mass-47 clumped isotope thermometer allows one to elucidate the temperature of carbonate formation and avoids speculation about the composition of precipitating water and/or oxygen composition of another mineral phase, as is required for conventional stable isotope thermometry. Recent studies have tried to reconstruct surface paleotemperatures to resolve paleoclimate or paleoelevation using this technique. Mass-47 measured from carbonates preserved in the geologic record; however, are potentially affected by burial and/or diagenetic alteration. These effects are poorly understood. Here we investigate the effect of burial on the ∆-47 composition of lacustrine carbonates. We collected samples, on the surface and recovered from drill cores, from two regions in the greater Green River Basin (Wyoming), the Washakie Basin and the Pinedale Anticline. Both basins were filled with thick, continuous Cretaceous – Eocene lacustrine strata. From these two sections, lacustrine carbonates were sampled over a paleodepth range of 1–6 km.\nThe ∆-47 compositions of the carbonates have been measured over the first two kilometers of depth and the clumped temperatures compared with peak temperatures estimated from vitrinite reflectance, fluid inclusion thermometry and basin thermal models. Although slightly warmer than MAT estimates from Eocene paleosol geochemistry (~24°C), clumped isotope temperatures are consistently ~40°C across this depth range, similar to clumped-isotope paleotemperature estimates for the Eocene Bighorn Basin. Peak temperatures of the carbonate samples reached 120°C, while modern downhole temperatures of the deepest samples are 50°C.\nThese results suggest that the ∆-47 thermometer preserves a record of surficial temperatures during Eocene time and that the ∆-47 thermometry is not apparently affected by burial to temperatures of at least 120°C. Effects of burial to greater depths (~6 km) and higher temperatures (~200°C) is in progress to evaluate the robustness of the ∆-47 thermometer at preserving surficial temperatures under these conditions.",

Under the southward IMF, dayside magnetic reconnection leads to a penetration of magnetic flux and energy into the magnetosphere. The magnetic flux and energy are then transported to the magnetotail, which leads to a current sheet thinning and subsequent magnetotail reconnection with multiple X-lines. The magnetotail reconnection is typical collisionless fast reconnection with Hall effect included. Multiple small-scale highly 3-D FRs are generated through the multiple X-lines reconnection. Both of the tailward and earthward moving FRs are observed in the near-tail plasma sheet, and detailed structure and evolution of the FRs are investigated. Coalescence between the FRs can also be observed during the evolution, which leads to the ion parallel heating inside the newly generated FRs. The ion velocity distributions and energy spectra show that the ions are accelerated in the vicinity of the reconnection X-lines. On the other hand, the ions are heated in the FRs and reconnection high-speed outflows.",

            "abstract": "Wave-influenced deltas are shaped by wave-driven transport of river-borne sediments. Near the river mouth, combined jet and wave dynamics, along with morphodynamic feedbacks, control the fraction of sediment transported alongshore by littoral currents that can bypass the river channel. Here we study how different bypassing rates influence large-scale delta evolution and examine the effect of waves and the river mouth jet on alongshore sediment bypassing.\nFirst, we use a modified version of the Coastline Evolution Model (CEM) to look at the effects of wave climate, fluvial sediment supply, and alongshore sediment bypassing rates on channel orientation. This modified version of CEM progrades the channel in a direction perpendicular to the local shoreline orientation at the river mouth, allowing feedbacks between alongshore sediment transport and fluvial sediment delivery to steer the river channel. Additionally, we allow a prescribed fraction of littoral sediment to bypass the river mouth. We find that deltas that have a large fluvial sediment flux can orient themselves into the direction of dominant wave approach. Lower fluvial inputs result in channels that are deflected downdrift, with increasing deflection as bypassing is reduced. In contrast, channels do not deflect downdrift (but can reorient themselves updrift for large fluvial fluxes) when full bypassing is allowed. These results demonstrate the importance of river mouth sediment bypassing on delta growth patterns, but, as we explore arbitrary bypassing laws, the simulations cannot help us constrain natural bypassing fluxes.\nTo further investigate the natural extent and mechanisms of bypassing, we use the coupled hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model Delft3D-SWAN. With a simplified shoreface and river channel, the model is able to construct river mouth morphology from the combined action of alongshore transport and a river mouth jet. Exploring river mouth morphology and sediment bypassing under various wave and fluvial conditions, we find that bypassing rates can be highly variable, and strongly depend on jet stability, fluvial sediment properties and inlet geometry. Waves increase jet spreading and promote jet deflection, and can help create an efficient bypassing regime through morphodynamic feedbacks that involve bar creation and elongation.",

            "abstract": "Field data on evapotranspiration are of crucial importance for ecohydrological and hydrometeorological studies in the tropics. Probably the most direct way to measure evapotranspiration is with the eddy covariance method, in which the latent heat flux (λE) is calculated from turbulent fluctuations of vertical wind velocity and humidity. The humidity fluctuations are typically measured with some type of fast-response infrared hygrometer. However, these sensors are expensive, which can be problematic if research budgets are limited. Turbulent fluctuations of humidity can also be measured with fast-response dry- and wet-bulb thermocouples, which can be constructed easily and at a fraction of the price of infrared sensors. The idea of using dry- and wet-bulb thermocouples for measuring λE with the eddy covariance method is not new, but hasn't been tested recently, possibly because experiments in the late seventies showed that this approach is not without problems due to the slow response of the wet-bulb thermocouple. In the present study, values of λE derived from dry- and wet-bulb thermocouple measurements were compared with those obtained using a fast-response KH20 hygrometer. Measurements were made above a shaded coffee plantation and a sugarcane crop in central Veracruz, Mexico. The agreement between λE obtained with the thermocouples (y) and the hygrometer (x) was very good for both vegetation covers: y = 0.98x + 5.0 (W m-2), r2 = 0.93 (coffee plantation); y = 0.99x – 13.3 (W m-2), r2 = 0.88 (sugarcane). However, the correction factor (CF) for high frequency loss in the wet-bulb temperature signal was considerably higher for the low-statured sugarcane crop (CF = 1.33) as compared to the taller shaded coffee plantation (CF = 1.09). Nevertheless, as long as care is taken in the derivation of this correction factor, reliable λE data can be obtained using the dry- and wet-bulb thermocouples, offering a cheap alternative to infrared hygrometers.",

            "abstract": "River managers need practical tools to promote appropriately hyporheic functions in restoration schemes. Hyporheic ecosystems are largely controlled by hydrological processes, which may be simulated through physically-based models. Despite their apparent limitations (sophisticated, data-hungry, and computationally demanding), these models offer substantial advantages that may pertain to the operational level of river management: representation of specific landscapes, process-based sensitivity analyses, and alternative restoration scenario testing. This presentation builds on idealized and field-based studies, as well as literature examples, to discuss how physically-based models of hyporheic exchange can be fully exploited for restoration purposes. Results suggest that these models are best suited to map spatial patterns of exchange at the sediment-water interface, rather than to estimate HEF fluxes and residence times. Because subsurface data are typically unavailable or sparse, an approach combining high-resolution topographic data combined with a sensitivity analysis appears as a promising approach for: (a) delineating potential areas of upwelling and downwelling along longitudinal and lateral channel sections; and (b) highlighting potential differences in HEF characteristics between reaches. To achieve satisfactory simulations, however, the challenge lies in the topographic representation of the channel and the discretization of the mesh. Here, common pitfalls are identified, and guidance to overcome these is provided.",

            "abstract": "Fluids have long been suggested to play an important role in slow earthquake generation. High pore-pressures that lower the effective normal stress where slow earthquakes occur are due to a build-up of metamorphic fluids that are trapped at the plate interface. We analyze a low-frequency earthquake (LFE) catalog of unprecedented density to study the response of the Guerrero subduction to a Mw 7.5 slow-slip event (SSE). About half-way through the SSE, we observe a significant deceleration of LFE activity in the deep part of the subduction that then propagates towards the trench over a series of several weeks. We also investigate the recurrence of LFE bursts as a function of distance from the trench and find that the LFE recurrence decreases with increasing distance from the trench before the SSE. During the six month-long SSE, however, the LFE burst recurrence is uniform across ~80 km. Taking into consideration these two observations, we suggest that plate interface permeability is significantly increased during the SSE and a large-scale fluid migration towards the trench takes place along the subduction interface. Sustained fluid migration over the first half of the SSE eventually drains the plate interface in the downdip slow earthquakes source region. The reduced pore-pressure of the drained plate interface, and the consequent increase of effective normal stress, significantly reduces the LFE activity. After the SSE, fluid pressure is then recharged from the surrounding area over several months. This proposed large-scale fluid migration mechanism explains our observations and also provides a source for episodic fluid discharges during megathrust events updip in the seismogenic zone.",

Numerical models are able to partially alleviate this issue by filling temporal and spatial data gaps and hence resolving annual area-integrated nutrient fluxes. Here a land-ocean-biogeochemical modeling system was implemented to simulate the nitrogen budget during 2004-2007 on the U.S. eastern continental shelf. Quantitative model skill assessment was conducted via extensive comparisons to satellite observations, and in situ data where available. Model simulations demonstrate that denitrification and burial fluxes have pronounced seasonal variation but change little from year to year. In contrast, annual net community production (NCP) varies significantly between years, but overall is positive indicating a net autotrophic system. Whereas the advective influx of nitrogen from the bays and rivers on the western boundary of the shelf changes only slightly among the four years examined, the advective fluxes across the eastern and northern boundaries change dramatically. These changes are associated with changes in the positions of the relatively high-nutrient Labrador Sea waters advecting into the shelf from the north, and the relatively low-nutrient Gulf Stream waters advecting into the region from the southeast. Tests varying the initial conditions (reduced spin-up) and simplifying the modeled plankton structure showed distinct impacts on these nitrogen fluxes: the former strongly affected the advective fluxes, but had little impact on denitrification, burial or NCP, whereas the latter significantly reduced denitrification, burial, and NCP but did not significantly impact the advective fluxes.",

Moraine-dammed lakes are capable of impounding volumes of water in excess of 107 m3, and often represent a very real threat to downstream communities and infrastructure, should the bounding moraine fail and produce a catastrophic Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Modelling the individual components of a GLOF, including a triggering event, the complex dam-breaching process and downstream propagation of the flood is incredibly challenging, not least because direct observation and instrumentation of such high-magnitude flows is virtually impossible. We briefly review the current state-of-the-art in numerical GLOF modelling, with a focus on the theoretical and computational challenges associated with reconstructing or predicting GLOF dynamics in the face of rates of cryospheric change that have no historical precedent, as well as various implications for researchers and professionals tasked with the production of hazard maps and disaster mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Water is a critical pathway between changes in climate and impacts on human health. Increased intensity of the hydrologic cycle can impair water quality through both drought and runoff associated with extreme precipitation events. Local changes or extremes in hydrological cycles can also alter the life cycles of moquitoes, ticks, snails, and other carriers of human diseases. These impacts in turn can affect the transmission of malaria, schistosomiasis, and many other human diseases. Warmer freshwater and coastal waters, in combination with other factors like fertilizer runoff and salinity, are also associated with proliferation of a variety of human pathogens, including cyanobacteria and vibrio species.\nThis presentation will highlight the many linkages between climate change, water and human health. It will review recent findings of the US National Climate Assessment and 5th Assessment Report of the IPCC with regards to water-related threats to health, and discuss approaches to modeling health outcomes of water-associated climate change impacts.",

            "abstract": "The Triassic Period was punctuated by two of the largest Phanerozoic mass-extinctions and witnessed the evolution of elements of the modern biota and the advent of the age of dinosaurs. A rich archive of biotic and environmental changes on land for the early Mesozoic is on the Colorado Plateau, which despite over 100 years of study still remains poorly calibrated in time and poorly registered to other global records. Over 15 years ago, a diverse team of scientists began to develop the concept of a multi-phase, long term Colorado Plateau Coring Project (CPCP). Planning involved two major meetings (DOSECC/NSFICDP supported in Fall, 2007, St. George, UT; and International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) supported in Spring, 2009, Albuquerque, NM). The National Park Service embraced the concept of Phase One drilling at Petrified Forest National Park (PFNP) in northern Arizona, which exposes one of the most famous and best studied successions of the continental Triassic on Earth, and the Phase One target was decided. Most drilling operation costs were secured from ICDP in Summer, 2010. In late 2013, following more recent NSF support, the research team, utilizing Ruen Drilling Inc., drilled a continuous ~530 m core (60o plunge) through the entire section of Triassic strata (Chinle and Moenkopi fms.) in the north end and a ~240 m core (75o plunge) in lower Chinle and all Moenkopi strata at the south end of the PFNP. Our continuous sampling will place this record in a reliable quantitative and exportable time scale, as a reference section in which magnetostratigraphic, geochronologic, environmental, and paleontologic data are registered to a common thickness scale with unambiguous superposition using pristine samples. The cores are being scanned at the High Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility at UT Austin. They will be transported to the LacCore National Lacustrine Core Facility at U Minnesota, where they will be split, imaged, and scanned for several properties, including XRF data. The core will then be transported to the Rutgers University for sampling. The planning team is contemplating Phase Two options (e.g., the Middle to Lower Triassic marine-influenced section west of the Colorado Plateau (St. George, Utah) area or the Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic sequence in the Comb Ridge area (Bluff, Utah)).",

The oldest sedimentary rocks in the 50 m above igneous basement may correspond to the time of subduction initiation to the east. They are lithologically complex, consisting of a mix of variably tuffaceous mudstone, sandstone and breccia-conglomerate with some basaltic andesite passing upsection into 50 m of reddish-brown, radiolarian-bearing hemipelagic mudstone with thin volcaniclastic siltstone to sandstone beds. Coarser volcaniclastic rocks (andesitic average whole rock composition) then dominate the overlying section from 1360 to 160 mbsf. Variably graded tuffaceous sandstone to conglomerate and breccia beds range from a few cm to 9 m in thickness and exhibit a wide range of bedding contact relationships and sedimentary structures, including partial to complete Bouma sequences. Gravel to silt-sized volcaniclastic sediment was likely delivered to the site by gravity flows ranging from low- to high-concentration turbidity currents to debris flows. The depositional setting was ~ 50 km from the main arc front (Palau-Kyushu Ridge, PKR), so these may represent very distal apron to fan deposits. The sharp decline in coarse volcanic sediment supply and switch to hemipelagic mud accumulation at ~160mbsf is coincident with the C. 25 Ma transformation of the KPR to a remnant arc by backarc spreading in the adjacent Shikoku Basin and the eastward migration of magmatic arc activity to the IBM.",

            "abstract": "Late Quaternary deep sea sediments in the Arctic Ocean are characterized by brown layers intercalated with yellowish to olive gray layers. It has been known that the brown and gray layers were deposited during interglacial (or interstadial) and glacial (or stadial) periods, respectively. A 5.5-m long gravity core MA01 was obtained from the Mendeleev Ridge in the western Arctic Ocean by R/V Xue Long during scientific cruise CHINARE-V. Age (~1.0 Ma) of core MA01 was tentatively decided by correlation of sediment color cycles, XRF Mn and Ca cycles, and geomagnetic inclinations with core HLY0503-8JPC (Adler et al., 2009) and core HLY0503-06JPC(Cronin et al., 2013) that were also collected from the Mendeleev Ridge area. A total of 23 brown layers are characterized by low L* and b*, high Mn concentration, and abundant foraminifera. In contrast, gray layers are characterized by high L* and b*, low Mn concentration, and few foraminiferal tests. Foraminifera abundance peaks are not well correlated to CaCO3 peaks which are accompanied with the coarse-grained (>63 μm) fractions (i.e., IRD) both in brown and gray layers. A strong positive correlation coefficient (r2=0.89) between TOC content and C/N ratio indicates that the major source of organic matter is terrestrial. The good correlations of CaCO3 content to TOC (r2=0.56) and C/N ratio (r2=0.69) imply that IRDs contain detrital CaCO3 fraction which mainly originated from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In addition, high kaolinite/chlorite (K/C) ratios mostly correspond to CaCO3 peaks, also suggesting that the fine-grained particles in the Mendeleev Ridge were transported from the northern coasts of the Alaska and Canada. Thus, the Beaufort Gyre, the predominant surface current in the western Arctic Ocean, has played an important role in the sediment delivery to the Mendeleev Ridge. It is worthy of note that TOC and CaCO3 peaks are obviously distinct in the upper part of core MA01, whereas these peaks are reduced in the lower part of the core. More study on these contrasting features is in progress.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the last 1500 yr precipitation record archived in the mixed carbonate/siliciclastic sediments accumulated in the Belize Central Shelf Lagoon, part of the Yucatan Peninsula eastern continental margin, proximal to the land areas where the Mayan Civilization thrived and then abruptly collapsed. This study is mainly based upon the detailed analyses of cores, BZE-RH-SVC-58 and 68, retrieved in 30 and 19 m of water depth from Elbow Caye Lagoon and English Caye Channel, respectively. The core timeframe is well-constrained by AMS radiocarbon dating of benthic foraminifera, Quinqueloculina. Carbonate content was determined by carbonate bomb, particle size fractions with a Malvern Master Sizer 2000 particle size analyzer, and element (Ti, Si, K, Fe, Al, Ca, and Sr) counts via X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). The variations of elements such as Ti and K counts, and Ti/Al in these two cores have recorded, in the past past 1500 years, the weathering rate variations of the adjacent Maya Mountain, defining alternating periods of high precipitation and droughts, linked to large climate fluctuations and extreme events, highly influenced by the ITCZ latitudinal migration.\nThe CE 800-900 century just preceding the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), characterized by unusually low Ti counts and Ti/Al, is interpreted to represent a time of low precipitation and resulting severe droughts in the Yucatan Peninsula, contemporaneous with the Mayan Terminal Classic Collapse. High Ti counts and Ti/Al, although highly variable, during the MCA (CE 900-1350) are interpreted as an unusually warm period characterized by two 100-to-250 years-long intervals of higher precipitation when the number of tropical cyclones peaked. These two intervals of high precipitation during the MCA are separated by a century (CE 1000 -1100) of severe droughts and low tropical storm frequency coinciding with the collapse of Chichen Itza (CE 1040-1100). The Little Ice Age (CE 1350-1850), several centuries during which Ti counts and Ti/Al reach minimum values, is characterized by systematic drier and colder climate conditions with low frequency of tropical cyclones. Two extreme Ti and K count minima might coincide with historical drought times and related Caribbean-wide famines in the year CE 1535 and the last third of the 18th century (CE 1765-1800).",

Our objective was to study the drought impact on the dynamics of Carbon, and water cycles, as well as the interaction between them under extreme climatic conditions in the plant soil continuum.\nThe first phase of the experiment involved 13CO2 pulse labeling of drought exposed and well-water beech microcosms, during which we monitored the 13C allocation to roots, and in the soil by measuring the CO2 concentration, ∂13C, and ∂18O of root derived CO2. We found that drought had a significant impact on, a) carbon assimilation, allocation, and translocation rate in the plant – soil system. The drought stressed plants not only assimilated fewer amounts of CO2, but also translocation of those assimilates belowground was extremely slow, and root respiration was low in comparison the well watered control plants.\nThe second phase involved rewetting of the drought chambers (and the application of similar amounts of water to the controls) using D218O enriched water followed by an additional 13CO2 pulse labeling approach so as to study the effects of drought on the infiltration patterns of a precipitation event as well as the recovery of the carbon relations of previously drought stressed beech saplings.",

            "abstract": "Transition zone discontinuities, among all, hold the key to resolve the mystery of mass and heat transport in the Earth’s mantle and the composition of the Earth’s interior. In previous efforts, the data are limited to either upper mantle triplications, converted waves or mantle reflections (e.g. SS precursors, ScS reverberations). When multiple datasets are jointly analyzed, they are often restrained at relatively long period (~ 0.1 Hz). To complement previous efforts, we advocate a simple and effective strategy to tackle a number of seismic observables altogether. Specifically, we involve broadband direct converted waves (e.g., P410s, P660s) and the topside reflections (the multiples, e.g., PpP410s, PpP660s) in the context of P wave receiver function technique. Such a tactic not only minimizes tradeoffs between velocity and density jumps, but also allows a superior resolution on the sharpness of the boundary and a detailed description of transition zone discontinuities.\nHere we summarize our first attempt in the region of stagnant slab beneath Chinese continent. We processed waveforms from 1000 stations of the Chinese seismic array using an automatic scheme to remove noisy waveforms and retained close to ~300,000 high quality receiver functions in the L-Q-T coordinate system. While avoiding interferences from other mantle waves, we perform slowness stacking of direct converted waves and the multiples, respectively, at several discrete frequency bands between 0.05 Hz and 1Hz and obtain amplitude estimates and uncertainties through the bootstrap method. To properly calibrate the amplitudes of receiver functions, we take into account the effect of incoherent stacking due to discontinuity topography and frequency-dependent attenuation. Our findings indicate that the 410 is a sharp boundary with a small density jump (<< 5 km, ΔVs=5-6%, Δρ=1.5-2%), but there is no significant gradient near the sharp transition. While the 660 is best described by a sharp boundary and a moderate density jump (<< 5 km, ΔVs=3.5-4%, Δρ=4-4.5%), there is a substantial gradient near the boundary (> 3x10-3 km/s/km, > 3x10-3 g/cm3/km). We will discuss the implications of these new findings in the context of thermochemical state of the transition zone in a separate presentation (Song et al. S034: Theory of Earth, this meeting).",

            "abstract": "Central Chile is a tectonically active, drought-prone region sensitive to latitudinal variations in large-scale cold fronts associated with fluctuations of the Pacific subtropical high. Holocene high-resolution records of climate and volcanic events could help inform more on the frequency of extensive droughts as well as volcanic and seismic hazards. LdM is a high altitude, volcanic lake located in the Transition Southern Volcanic Zone (~36°S, 2200 m.a.s.l). The LdM volcanic field is a very seismically and volcanically active zone in the Andes, with several caldera-forming eruptions over the last 1.5 Ma, and intense postglacial activity.\nIn 2013, we recovered over 40 m of sediment cores at four sites of LdM and collected > 20 km of seismic lines. The cores were imaged, their physical and geochemical properties analysed with a Geotek MSCL and XRF scanner respectively, and sampled for TOC, TIC, TS, TN, BioSi, and bulk mineralogy. The chronology was constructed with a Bayesian age-depth model including 210Pb-137Cs, the Quizapú volcanic ash (1932 AD) and 17 AMS 14C dates. The 4.8 m long composite sequence spans the Late glacial and Holocene.\nSediments are massive to banded, quartz and plagioclase-rich silts with variable diatom (BioSi, 15- 30 %) and organic matter content (TOC, 1–5 %). Four main units have been defined based on sedimentological and geochemical composition. The transition from Unit 4 to 3 is ascribed to the onset of the Holocene; Unit 2 spans the mid Holocene, and Unit 1 the last 4 ka. Higher (lower) TOC, Br/Ti and Fe/Mn ratios in units 1 and 3 (2 and 4) suggest higher (lower) organic productivity in the lake and dominant oxic (anoxic) conditions at the bottom of the lake. Up to 17 ash and lapilli layers mark volcanic events, mostly grouped in units 1 and 3. Periods of higher lake productivity (units 1 and 3) are synchronous to higher frequency of volcanic events. Some climate transitions (LIA, 4ka, 8ka and 11ka) are evident in the LdM sequence underlining their paleohydrological regional significance.",

            "abstract": "The extent to which forest growth is limited by carbon (C) supply (source control) or by cambial activity (sink control) will strongly determines the responses of trees to global changes. However, the physiological processes responsible for the limitation of forest growth are still under debate. The aim of this study was i) to evaluate the key drivers of the annual carbon allocation to wood along large soil and climate regional gradients in four tree species representative of the main European forest biomes (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Quercus ilex and Picea abies) ii) to implement the identified key drivers in a new C allocation scheme within the CASTANEA terrestrial biosphere model (TBM). Combining field measurements and process-based simulations at 49 sites (931 site-years), our analyses revealed that the inter-site variability in C allocation to wood was predominantly driven by an age-related decline. The direct control of temperature or water stress on sink activity (i.e. independently from their effects on C supply) exerted a strong influence on the annual woody growth in all the species considered, including deciduous temperate species. The lagged effect of the past environment conditions was a significant driver of the annual C allocation to wood. Carbon supply appeared to strongly limit growth only in deciduous temperate species. Our study supports the premise that European forest growth is under a complex panel of source- and sink- limitations, contradicting the simple source control implemented in most TBMs. The implementation of these combined forest growth limitations in the CASTANEA model significantly improved its performance when evaluated against independent stand growth data at the regional scale (mainland France, >103 plots). We finally discuss how the sink imitation affects the CASTANEA simulated projections of forest productivity along the 21th century, especially with respect to the expected fertilizing effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. The new C allocation scheme will allow refining the projections of the impacts of global changes on forest growth, with implications on the predicted evolution of the forest C sink, forest dieback and tree species distributions.",

            "abstract": "The Mekong River and its tributaries comprise one of the most productive fish habitats in the world today. The economic value of the Mekong fishery in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam is among the highest in the world, providing income and food security to tens of millions of people. However, the construction of multiple dams in the basin will reduce sediment discharge, which will adversely impact nutrient transport and habitat quality and availability, and disrupt fish migration routes. Thus, of considerable interest is the identification of alternatives to the location, design and operation of planned hydropower dams that could improve sediment passage, enable migratory fish passage, and sustain fish production for local use. This paper describes the results of simulation studies designed to identify and evaluate such alternatives, as well as their potential impact on hydropower production. Dam sites in Cambodia and Lao PDR on tributaries and on the mainstream Mekong River will be discussed. Evaluations of sediment management techniques such as flushing, sluicing and bypassing will be discussed. This study is intended to inform decision makers in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam about potential alternatives to current plans as they prepare decisions regarding the development of over 100 hydropower dams throughout the basin.",

            "abstract": "The Panzhihua, Hongge and Baima mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions host three giant Fe-Ti oxide deposites in the Pangzhihua-Xichang (Panxi) region, SW China. Various proportions of silicates (plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine), ilmenite and magnitite form rhythmic layering in the upper part of the intrusions. The origin of rhythmic layering in mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions has been debated for a long time in the literatures. Here we provide detailed FTIR and EBSD studies on the water content and deformation microstructure of gabbros from the Panzhihua intrusion. The FTIR analyses revealed a significant amount of hydroxyls in both clinopyroxene (411-775 ppm) and plagioclase (328-716 ppm), suggesting a high water content mantle plume source. The EBSD analyses show: 1) a weak clinopyroxene fabric of (100) parallel to foliation and [001] parallel to lineation; 2) a strong plagioclase fabric of (010) parallel to foliation and [100] parallel to lineation; 3) a weak ilmenite fabric of (001) parallel to foliation and [hk0] parallel to lieantion; 4) a near random magnitite fabric. These results suggest weak plagioclase is the main strain accommedation phase in lower crustal rocks under hydrous conditions, which is also consistent with previous deformation experiments on plagioclase and clinoproxene. Water plays an important role in deteriming the rheology contrast between plagioclase and clinoproxene. Our results revealed strong layer-parallel shearing deformation during the formation of the Panxi layered intrusions. We propose that the formation of the rhythmic layering is mainly caused by rheological stratification rather than chemical stratification of Fe-Ti oxides and gabbros.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the onset of Pi2 pulsations in ground magnetometers and substorm onset has been used extensively over the years to determine when and where substorm onset takes place. However, there are still many questions concerning how and where the Pi2 pulsations themselves are generated, how they propagate through the system, and their relationship to flow bursts in the plasma sheet.\nIn order to investigate Pi2 generation and propagation through the magnetosphere, and their relationship to bursty flows, we have modeled a substorm on 14-Sep-2004 using both the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) and the UCLA 3D global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. By using two different models we show that the perturbations develop as a result of the equations, and do not depend on the set-up or numerical methods used in a particular model. The results from both models show that, in the braking region, the region where flows are slowed as they approach the inner edge of the plasma sheet, Pi2 period pulsations develop in the magnetic field, velocity, and pressure, concurrently with the arrival of fast earthward flows and their associated dipolarization fronts. The disturbance generated by the fast flows at the inner edge of the plasma sheet creates Alfvén waves that map to auroral regions and compressional waves that propagate deeper into the inner magnetosphere. The fast flows also generate Pi2 period fluctuations in the field aligned currents at the inner edge of the plasma sheet and in the inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Being multidisciplinary, while admired, is not viewed as a goal of education. Instead, extreme specialization is emphasized. One seeks to attain mastery of a given subject, but at what cost? Even those fields viewed as “interdisciplinary” are often quite narrow in scope, only permitting the most closely related subjects to coalesce. The arts however, are by nature both inter- and multi-disciplinary. They attempt to research, analyze, and reflect upon broader questions, often employing techniques garnered from far-flung fields in order to do so. It is an unfortunate dilemma then that the artist should seem so separate from the scientist, as it seems that both are engaged in a sort of hypothesis testing. Perhaps this division is a remnant of the antiquated left- and right-brained dichotomy, which clearly separated the two groups: Science and Art, Left and Right. In this way, the artist was branded as Science’s “other,” despite the inherent sameness of their processes. This “otherness” has been carried forward to the present, where artists are often viewed as simply craftspeople -object makers- and the concept of the “artistic problem” is rarely considered. As someone possessing degrees in both Fine Art and Hydrology, the author attempts to explain the connection between the two subjects, and the manner in which they compliment and enlighten each other in her own research. She hypothesizes that in addition to this “otherness,” it is the multi-dimensional mode of thinking and dealing with problems that sets the artist apart. But this is a dynamic trait, and as such, it should be considered that by approaching scientific endeavors as artistic problems, the researcher could be permitted a broader framework in which to answer a given scientific question.",

            "abstract": "Thirty years have passed since establishment of the IRIS Program for the Array Seismic Studies of the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL). PASSCAL was part of a coordinated plan proposed to the National Science Foundation (NSF) defining the instrumentation, data collection and management structure to support a wide range of research in seismology. The PASSCAL program has surpassed the early goal of 6000 data acquisition channels with a current inventory of instrumentation capable of imaging from the near surface to the inner core. Here we present the evolution of the PASSCAL program from instrument depot to full service community resource.\nPASSCAL has supported close to 1100 PI driven seismic experiments since its inception. Instruments from PASSCAL have covered the globe and have contributed over 7400 SEED stations and 242 assembled data sets to the IRIS Data Management Center in Seattle. Since the combination in 1998 of the Stanford and Lamont instrument centers into the single PASSCAL Instrument Center (PIC) at New Mexico Tech, the facility has grown in scope by adding the EarthScope Array Operations Facility in 2005, the incorporation of the EarthScope Flexible Array, and a Polar support group in 2006. The polar support group enhances portable seismic experiments in extremely harsh polar environments and also extends to special projects such as the Greenland Ice Sheet Monitoring Network (GLISN) and the recent development effort for Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice Covered Environments (GEOICE). Through these support efforts the PIC has established itself as a resource for field practices, engineered solutions for autonomous seismic stations, and a pioneer in successful seismic recording in polar environments.\nWe are on the cusp of a new generation of instrumentation driven in part by the academic community’s desire to record unaliased wavefields in multiple frequency bands and industry’s interest in utilizing lower frequency data. As part of the recently funded IRIS proposal to NSF for support of Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience and EarthScope (SAGE), IRIS is developing plans for this new instrumentation that will ensure that the PASSCAL program continues to provide state-of-the-art observing capabilities into the coming decades.",

To bridge this gap, NSF- and ICDP-funded coring of Phase 1 of the CPCP finished in 12/2013 with the recovery of two major cores (1A, 518m and 2B, 253m; 31km apart) from opposites sides of Petrified Forest National Park spanning nearly the entire Triassic sequence (Chinle & Moenkopi fms) with many U-Pb datable levels (1,2,3) and a recoverable paleomagnetic polarity record (4). The cores will provide a U-Pb and paleomagnetic exportable time scale and sedimentary and geochemical proxies with undoubted superposition testing the motivating hypotheses of: 1) the accuracy of orbitally-paced cyclicity of the Newark APTS (5); 2) apparent climate trends as a function of drift through climate belts (6) and atmospheric CO2 (7); 3) the temporal link between the mid-Late Triassic biotic turnover and the ~100 km Manicouagan impact (1); and 4) the delayed ecological dominance of dinosaurs coupled to climate-driven provinciality (1,8). For orientation, the cores were drilled using a azimuth-tracking device, deviated 30° and 15° from vertical to the SE and S, and CT-scanned. The unprecedented sedimentological and stratigraphic detail visible in the CT-scans, and geophysical logs, plus the ~100% recovery promises successful tests of the motivating hypotheses and provide a superbly detailed reference section for this key episode in Earth system history.\n1, Irmis+,2011, EPSL 309:258; 2, Ramazani+, 2011, GSA Bull. 123:2142; 3, Ramazani+, 2014, AJS 314:981; 4, Steiner & Lucas, 2000, JGR B 105:25791; 5, Kent & Olsen, 1999, JGR 104(B6):12831-12841; 6, Kent and Tauxe, 2005, Science 307:240–244; 7, Schaller+, 2012, EPSL 323-324:27–39; 8, Kent +, 2014, PNAS 111:7958–7963.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the formation and history of sediments is a fundamental aspect of geologic research. The abundance of quartz makes the mineral an important component of continentally-derived sediments, yet most sedimentary provenance studies rely on minerals that generally exist in low abundance in both clastic sediments and source rocks. Quartz crystallizes over a wide range of geologic conditions— from low temperature α-quartz (e.g., veins) to the high temperature and pressure α- and β-quartz stability limits in igneous and metamorphic regimes. The diversity of quartz-forming environments is reflected in similarly unique trace-element signatures (notably Ti and Al) in quartz. The Ti and Al content of quartz can therefore be used to determine the original quartz-forming environments and provenance of grains that have been weathered from their parent rocks. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of quartz-based provenance research with a case study from the Bega River Catchment in New South Wales, Australia.\nBedrock in the Bega River catchment is composed primarily of pera- to metaluminous granitoids, while bedrock outside of the basin is mainly peraluminous and peralkaline granitoids. Quartz from these different granitoids display unique trace-element signatures that can be used to fingerprint sediments derived from them. Trace-element composition of quartz grains from sand in the Bega River catchment indicate that ~69.5 % (n=193) of the quartz population is derived from weathering of pera-metaluminous granitoids. This observation is consistent with the bedrock geology of the catchment and suggests that most of the quartz grains in the sediment load of the Bega River are derived from weathering of granitoids within the basin. The remaining quartz population is composed of 24.5 % (n=68) peralkaline granitoid and 6 % (n=17) low-Ti quartz, suggesting granitoids from within the basin are not the sole contributor to the basin’s sedimentary load.",

            "abstract": "Low flows are a seasonal hydrologic response generally during a drying period. Extreme low flows are a result of prolonged antecedent precipitation deficit and/or high evaporative demand, and can indicate hydrological droughts (water availability deficit) and ecological droughts (water quality degradation). Human impacts (e.g. dams, reservoirs, and power plants) also play a role in exacerbating the severity of low flow droughts. For drought mitigation, it is critical to better understand how low flows vary over time and their generating mechanisms. The goals of this study are to examine trends in low flows over the eastern U.S. and to assess their attributions and teleconnections in the context of climate change and variability.\nWe selected 149 out of 4878 USGS stations over the eastern U.S., taking into account data availability and minimal human impacts. We analyzed annual 7-day low flows (Q7) from the series of daily streamflow records for 1962-2011. We also computed an antecedent precipitation (AP) over the corresponding basin for each station. We found a north-south (increasing-decreasing) dipole pattern in Q7 trends and a monopole (increasing) pattern in AP trends, which indicates a gap between the trends of Q7 and AP over the southern part of the study region (Virginia, North and South Carolina). We found that these regions show significant increasing trends in potential evapotranspiration (PET) as driven by increasing temperatures and vapor pressure deficit. We also examined teleconnections between detrended Q7 and nine atmospheric and oceanic climate indices. We found that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific North America (PNA) pattern show prediction skill for Q7 at one and two month lead time, respectively. Our findings suggest that the worst scenario for future droughts over the eastern U.S. is a combination of a response to an increasing trend in temperature driving PET with strong negative NAO and positve PNA during summer.",

Many theories, modeling and data suggest that these events, seen as abrupt warming episodes in Greenland ice cores and sea surface temperature records in the North Atlantic, are linked to reorganizations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In this study, using a new low-order ocean model, we are able to reproduce a realistic power spectrum of this millennial variability, which emerges in the model as a result of unstable AMOC dynamics rather than due to external freshwater forcing. Within this model we explore differences in the AMOC stability between glacial and interglacial intervals of the 100 kyr glacial cycle of the Late Pleistocene. Previous modeling studies show that the edge of sea ice in the North Atlantic shifts southward during glacial intervals, moving the region of the North Atlantic Deep Water formation and the entire AMOC also southward. Here we demonstrate that, by altering the precipitation structure that the AMOC feels, such an expansion of sea ice cover makes the system unstable, which explains chaotic millennial variability during the glacials and the persistence of stable ocean conditions during the interglacials.",

            "abstract": "Within the cold interior of western and northern Canada, rapid and widespread environmental changes are taking place, which are of serious concern for society and have a range of implications from local to regional and global scales. From a scientific standpoint there is an urgent need to understand the changes and develop improved diagnostic and predictive modelling tools to deal with the uncertainty faced in the future. The Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) is a research consortium of over 50 Canadian university and government scientists and international researchers aimed at addressing these issues within the geographic domain of the Mackenzie and Saskatchewan River Basins. CCRN’s primary focus is to integrate existing and new experimental data with modelling and remote sensing products to understand, diagnose and predict changing land, water and climate, and their interactions and feedbacks. To support these activities, the network utilizes a suite of 14 world-class water, ecosystem, cryosphere and climate (WECC) observatories across this region that provide exceptional opportunities to observe change, investigate processes and their dynamics, and develop and test environmental models. This talk will briefly describe the CCRN thematic components and WECC observatories, and will then describe some of the observed environmental changes and their linkages across the northern and mountainous parts of the network study domain. In particular, this will include changes in permafrost, terrestrial vegetation, snowcover, glaciers, and river discharge in relation to observed climatic changes across the region. The observations draw on a wide range of literature sources and statistical analyses of federal and provincial regional monitoring network data, while more detailed observations at some of the WECC observatories help to show how these regional changes are manifested at local scales and vice versa. A coordinated special observation and analysis period across all WECC observatories is planned for 2014–15, and this will also be briefly described.",

            "abstract": "Western Minnesota, USA, is a regional locus of drinking-water wells with high arsenic (As) (As>10µgL-1). Arsenic concentrations vary widely among neighboring wells with otherwise similar water chemistry [1,2]. As(III) should be the most mobile As species in Minnesota well waters (median Eh in As affected wells is -50mV). This As is geogenic, sourced from glacial deposits derived from Cretaceous sedimentary bedrock (dolostone, limestone, shale). Our hypothesis is that As speciation in the solid phase is the important factor controlling the introduction of As to groundwater—more significant in this region than absolute As concentrations or landscape variability.\nOur previous research used micro-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (µXAS) speciation mapping [3] on archived glacial tills (stored dry at room temperature in air). µXAS results from this material showed that As in a reduced chemical state within the till aquitard is spatially correlated with iron sulfide at the micron scale. Conversley, As in aquifer sediments was mainly oxidized As(V). At the aquifer-aquitard contact As was observed as a mixture of both reduced and oxidized forms. This suggests that the aquifer-aquitard contact is a geochemically active zone in which reduced As species present within glacial till are converted to As(V) through complex redox processes, and subsequently release into aquifer sediments.\n Our current research applies the same methods to describe As speciation in samples collected from fresh cores of glacial sediment and frozen under argon in the field. Preliminary results are similar to our previous work in that As is, in general, more reduced in aquitard sediments, and more oxidized at the contact and in aquifer sediments. Arsenic(III) was preserved as a minor consitutent in ambient archived cores but is a more significant constituent in fresh, anaerobically preserved cores. Results will be presented comparing anaerobic samples with ambient-air aliquots of the same sample to document changes in the relative abundance of As species depending on sample preservation.\nThis work was supported by LBNL-ALS, ANL-APS, USGS-MNWSC, MGS, and CURA.

            "abstract": "The Arctic is a complex and poorly studied aerosol environment, impacted by strong anthropogenic contributions during winter months and by regional sources in cleaner summer months. In order to gain a predictive understanding of the changing climate in this region, it is necessary to understand the balance between these two aerosol sources to clarify how aerosol might be altered by or contribute to climate change. We present results of vertically resolved, submicron aerosol composition from an Aerodyne high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) during the NETCARE 2014 Polar6 aircraft campaign. The campaign was based in the high Arctic, at Resolute, NU (74°N), allowing measurements from 60 to 2900 meters over ice, open water and near the ice-edge. Concurrent measurements aboard the Polar6 included ultrafine and accumulation mode particle number and size, cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, trace gas concentrations and single particle composition. Aerosol vertical profiles measured by the AMS can be broadly characterized into two regimes corresponding to different meteorological conditions: the first with very low aerosol loading (<0.1 μg/m3) at low altitudes compared to that aloft and high numbers of nucleation mode particles, and the second with higher concentrations at lower levels. This second regime was associated with low concentrations of nucleation mode particles, and higher observable levels of methane sulphonic acid (MSA) from AMS measurements at low altitudes. MSA, produced during the oxidation of dimethyl sulphide, is a marker for the contribution of ocean-derived biogenic sulphur to particulate sulphur and could be identified and quantified using the high-resolution AMS. MSA to sulphate ratios were observed to increase towards lower altitudes, suggesting a contribution to aerosol loading from the ocean. In addition, we present measurements of aerosol neutralization and the characteristics of organic aerosol that relate to the growth of ultrafine particles to accumulation mode sizes.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a novel method for classification and search of climate over the global land surface excluding Antarctica. Our method classifies climate on the basis of the outcome of time series segmentation and clustering. We use WorldClim 30 arc sec. (approx. 1 km) resolution grid data which is based on 50 years of climatic observations. Each cell in a grid is assigned a 12 month series consisting of 50-years monthly averages of mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures as well as the total precipitation.\nThe presented method introduces several innovations with comparison to existing data-driven methods of world climate classifications. First, it uses only climatic rather than bioclimatic data. Second, it employs object-oriented methodology – the grid is first segmented before climatic segments are classified. Third, and most importantly, the similarity between climates in two given cells is performed using the dynamic time warping (DTW) measure instead of the Euclidean distance.\nThe DTW is known to be superior to Euclidean distance for time series, but has not been utilized before in classification of global climate. To account for computational expense of DTW we use highly efficient GeoPAT software (http://sil.uc.edu/gitlist/) that, in the first step, segments the grid into local regions of uniform climate. In the second step, the segments are classified.\nWe also introduce a climate search – a GeoWeb-based method for interactive presentation of global climate information in the form of query-and-retrieval. A user selects a geographical location and the system returns a global map indicating level of similarity between local climates and a climate in the selected location. The results of the search for location: \"University of Cincinnati, Main Campus\" are presented on attached map. The results of the search for location: \"University of Cincinnati, Main Campus\" are presented on the map.\nWe have compared the results of our method to Koeppen classification scheme as well as to existing data-driven climate classification methods and concluded that our DWT-based method provides the new, superior analytical framework for studying climate variability on global scale.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice reemergence is a phenomenon in which spring sea ice anomalies are positively correlated with fall anomalies, despite a loss of correlation over the intervening summer months. Pan-Arctic sea ice reemergence is present in both observations and global climate models (GCMs), yet the amplitude and regional details of the reemergence signals vary substantially. In this work, a novel data analysis technique, coupled Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA), is employed to study the spatiotemporal co-variability of sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea level pressure (SLP) in the Arctic. NLSA modes are obtained for observational data and GCM output, and are used to examine the statistical characteristics and physical mechanisms of sea ice reemergence. It is found that lagged correlation features of the raw sea ice data can be efficiently reproduced using low-dimensional families of modes. These families provide an SST-sea ice reemergence mechanism, in which melt season (spring) sea ice anomalies are imprinted as SST anomalies and stored over the summer months, allowing for sea ice anomalies of the same sign to reappear in the growth season (fall). Moreover, the ice anomalies of each family exhibit clear phase relationships between the Barents-Kara, Bering, and Labrador seas. These regional phase relationships have a natural explanation via the SLP patterns and associated geostrophic winds of each family, which closely resemble the Arctic Oscillation and Arctic Dipole Anomaly. Additionally, the winter-to-winter persistence of these SLP patterns suggests another plausible mechanism for sea ice reemergence.",

            "abstract": "Exposures of deep crustal shear zones are fundamental records of strain localization and the temporal evolution of ductile to brittle behavior as these tectonites were exhumed to the surface. We present results from a decade of field-based research on a deeply exhumed (~35 km-paleodepths) strike-slip shear zone in the western Churchill province of the Canadian Shield. The Grease River shear zone is a >400 km-long and 7 km-thick structure that cuts the Athabasca granulite terrane, North America’s largest exposure of continental lower crust (>20,000 km2). The shear zone is dominated by granulite- to amphibolite-grade L-S and L>S tectonites characterized by penetrative NE-striking steeply-dipping foliations with gently-plunging to sub-horizontal stretching and intersection lineations. These fabrics are locally overprinted by pseudotachylyte and narrow (<500 m-thick) greenschist-grade zones of cataclasite. Dextral kinematics are defined by deflected foliation trajectories, C’ shear bands, and well-developed σ- and δ-type porphyroclasts of Kfs + Pl + Opx + Grt + Hb in felsic to intermediate granulite paragneisses and orthogneisses. Data collected along a well-exposed, nearly 150 km-long segment of the shear zone documents a >100 m.y. episodic record of transpressive to strike-slip intracontinental strain accumulation that coincided with two oppositely convergent orogenies: the east-vergent arc-continent collision of the 1.94-1.90 Ga Taltson orogen and the west-vergent continent-continent collision of the 1.9-1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson orogen. Deformation mechanisms evolved from distributed ductile dynamic recrystallization and grain-size reduction to localized pseudotachylyte development, cataclastic flow, and brittle faulting. Lower crustal behavior during strain localization was dynamic. Melt-weakened mono-cyclic crust was juxtaposed against strong isobarically-cooled poly-cyclic crust along the shear zone at 1.92-1.90 Ga. Brittle-ductile reactivation of the structure during exhumation to middle crustal levels was coincident with fluid-mediated retrograde reactions that facilitated crustal-scale segmentation and transpressive uplift of lower crustal granulites at 1.85 Ga. This study illustrates that lower crustal rheology is spatially and temporally heterogeneous.",

The ship-based (R/V Revelle and R/V Mirai) observations were parallel to those on the Gan Island, located ~800 km to the west. Analysis of the Gan Is. supersite data along with the observations from the R/V Revelle and R/V Mirai allow us to address the spatial variability of convection and environmental conditions associated with MJO initiation. The radar network also helps document the broader MJO convective envelope as it propagates slowly eastward, exiting the initiation region. Preliminary results show that the evolution of rainfall, precipitation types, and convective depth throughout the MJO life cycle are very similar between Gan Is. and R/V Revelle over the equator. On the other hand, precipitation and convection exhibit little MJO signature over R/V Mirai ~800 km off the equator. Precipitation tends to be more convective over the R/V Mirai than over the equator during DYNAMO. This study fully examines the convective properties and cloud population throughout the MJO life cycle using radar observations from these three locations.",

            "abstract": "Rifted margins develop generally through polyphased extensional events leading eventually to break-up. We investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of the Iberia-Newfoundland rifted margin from its Permian post-orogenic stage to early Cretaceous break-up. We have applied Quantitative Basin Analysis to integrate seismic stratigraphic interpretations and drill hole data of representative sections across the Iberia-Newfoundland margins with kinematic models for the thinning of the lithosphere and subsequent isostatic readjustment. Our goal is to predict the distribution of extension and thinning, environments of deposition, crustal structure and subsidence history as functions of space and time. The first sediments deposited on the Iberian continental crust were in response to Permian lithospheric thinning, associated with magmatic underplating and subsequent thermal re-equilibration of the lithosphere. During late Triassic-early Jurassic rifting, a broadly distributed depth-independent lithospheric extension occurred, followed by late Jurassic rifting that increasingly focused with time and became depth-dependent during the early Cretaceous. However, there exists a temporality in the along-strike deformation of the Iberia-Newfoundland margin: significant Valanginian-Hauterivian deformation characterizes the northern Galicia Bank-Flemish Cap while the southern Iberian-Newfoundland region is characterized by Tithonian-early Berriasian extension. Deformation localized with time on both margins leading to late Aptian break-up. To match the distribution and magnitude of subsidence across the profiles requires significant thinning of middle/lower crustal level and subcontinental lithospheric mantle, leading to the formation of the hyper-extended domains. The late-stage deformation of both margins was characterized by a predominantly brittle deformation of the residual continental crust, leading to exhumation of subcontinental mantle and ultimately to seafloor spreading. Our modeling results may provide critical insights into the 3D along-strike interaction of continental lithosphere thinning in terms of changing crustal structure and environments of deposition as well as implications for the regional, 3D subsidence evolution of rifted margins.",

            "abstract": "Experimentally determined partition coefficients for Fe-rich metallic systems are essential to constrain models of the formation and evolution of planetary cores. Solid metal-liquid metal partition coefficients (DSol/Liq) for many siderophile elements depend upon the light-element content of the liquid phase. This dependence can be described by an empirically determined interaction parameter (β). Oxygen is a potential light element in the cores of large planetary bodies. Direct measurements of the partition coefficients between solid and liquid alloys in the Fe-O system, however, are restricted to liquids with low O contents (<2.2 wt% O at 15 GPa; Langlade et al. LPSC, 2008). Measurements to derive β-values from Soret diffusion experiments allow us to extend our investigation to the larger compositional space present at higher temperature (Brenan & Bennett, EPSL, 2010). We performed experiments at 15 GPa in a 1500-tonne multi-anvil press, using starting materials that comprised Fe, Ni and FeO powders mixed with ~200 ppm each of the platinum group metals, W, Mn, Re and Au. Run-products were analysed by electron microprobe (Fe, Ni, O) and LA-ICP-MS (PGMs, W, Mn, Re, Au). Temperature along the sample was estimated from the thickness of a spinel layer formed at the interface between the Al2O3 capsule and MgO sleeve. Initial results show siderophile elements typically display O avoidance behavior and are concentrated toward the cold, Fe-rich portion of the sample. In one experiment however, that contains W and Re in weight percent concentrations, Mn and Re are concentrated toward the O-rich portion of the sample. Au concentrations remain approximately constant along the sample length. Results are used to predict the evolution of element ratios in the outer-core during inner-core crystallization. β-values may also be used to estimate changes to DMet/Sil that arise from O dissolved in core-forming metal.",

            "abstract": "Sphagnum peatlands are characterized by distinctive vegetation, hydrology and local climate. They are very important areas for flora and fauna. In the last decade, much effort was made at better understanding of microrefugia and their important role in post-glacial migration of various plant species. The aim of this study is to explain a long-term persistence of the glacial relict Betula nana in a Sphagnum peatland in northern Poland far from the southern range of its natural distribution. We suppose that the persistence of Betula nana is driven by a) the morphology and geology of the catchment, b) the maintenance of open vegetation on the peatland surface and c) exceptional microclimatic and hydrological conditions. A detailed research was carried out on the peat profile using pollen analysis, to reconstruct the presence of open habitat on the mire during the Holocene. Furthermore, detailed monitoring of local climate, hydrology of the peatland and the surrounding area was conducted. The pollen analysis revealed a continuous presence of Betula nana in the postglacial history of the peatland. The results of local climate monitoring indicated that the mire possesses a typical microclimate, with air temperature amplitude much higher in relation to the open area, in particular during the growing season. This, in combination with the hydrology, which depends on the geology of the surrounding area, affects Betula nana population. Linje mire is a unique microrefugium sustained by local factors such as microclimate, geology, local relief and hydrology. However, it is still challenging to explain the intriguing case why this species still occurs within the study site.\nThis work was funded by the National Science Centre grant NN306060940 and Polish-Swiss Research Programme PSPB-013/2010.

            "abstract": "Chemical composition and hygroscopicity are keys to understand the formation and evolution of atmospheric aerosol particles. However, relatively little information is available for sub-10 nm nanoparticles due to experimental difficulties. We present the design of a nano-cloud condensation nuclei (nano-CCN) counter for the purpose of measuring hygroscopicity and interpreting chemical compositions of sub-10 nm nanoparticles. Advanced than the previous studies (Kulmala et al., 2007;Mordas et al., 2008), here we explained the meaning of counting efficiency spectra of condensation particle counter (CPC) and its link to the CCN activation spectra, providing theoretical basis for the modification of CPC to a nano-CCN counter. Since CCN hygroscopicity has been demonstrated as an effective parameter reflecting organic and inorganic mass fractions, the nano-CCN counter may thus provide size-resolved information on the chemical composition of sub-10 nm nanoparticles.\nThe application was demonstrated through both by laboratory experiments and literature data on 2.5-nm particles. With a modified TSI 3788 water-CPC, sodium chloride (NaCl) and ammonium sulfate (AS) particles with 2.5 nm can be easily distinguished according to the activation spectra. Meanwhile, an indirect approach is also used to test the applicability of Köhler theory in the activation of nanoparticles, and the result showed that it still holds qualitatively (See Fig.1). This study improved and extended the understanding and application of CPC counting efficiency spectra. Though named nano-CCN counter, the design is not limited to the water-CPC, but also applies to CPCs of other working fluid (e.g. butanol). A combination of CPCs with multiple working fluids, as well as other instrumentations such as nano-HTDMA, might provide further insight into the chemical composition of nanoparticles, and the roles of diverse compounds in the initial steps of atmospheric new particle formation.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus is an intriguing planetary body, which possibly has the ingredients needed for life. Further, it has numerous (over 100) continuously erupting geysers that eject material into the atmosphere which provide a unique opportunity to sample the body’s internal chemistry from orbit. At JPL’s Planetary Science Summer School, Team X and a group of students developed a mission concept to directly sample Enceladus’ plumes. The mission, named Enceladus Environmental Explorer (EVE), follows NASA’s Planetary Science Decadal survey and would assess the potential habitability of Saturn’s icy satellite through analysis of the chemistry of the subsurface ocean and the nature of the organic chemistry in the plume. EVE would look at geological and geophysical surface processes of Enceladus by investigating the heat output of Enceladus, plumes’ mechanics, the extent of the liquid subsurface reservoir(s), and gravitational variation. The EVE mission concept aimed for a January 2023 launch on an Atlas 551 class launch vehicle and would arrive at Saturn July 2031. A two-year-long Saturn moon tour would allow sufficient deceleration to permit a polar orbital insertion around Enceladus in March 2035, remaining stable for 54 weeks of observation. The proposed instrument payload includes: 1) SUb MilliMeter Enceladus Radiometer (SUMMER; equivalent to Rosetta MIRO), 2) Enceladus Dust and Gas Experiment (EDGE; an enhanced version of Rosetta COSIMA), 3) MAGnetometer for Ionic Concentration (MAGIC; equivalent to MMS/ InSIGHT magnetometer), 4) Visual Imaging Camera with Topographic Observational Resolution (VICTOR) and 5) Enceladus Radio Gravity Science (ERGS). Our suggested orbital timeline would allow the most comprehensive dataset yet collected of a moon in the outer solar system, mapping the entire surface twice with SUMMER and VICTOR, while sampling the plume directly 232 times with EDGE. MAGIC would also provide over a year of sampling of the magnetic field variations from orbit. Enceladus Environmental Explorer (EVE) offers a unique opportunity to determine the potential for life on Enceladus.",

            "abstract": "In the present climate, the ocean below 2 km is mainly filled by waters sinking into the abyss around Antarctica and in the North Atlantic. Paleo proxies indicate that waters of North Atlantic origin were instead absent below 2 km at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), resulting in an expansion of the volume occupied by Antarctic origin waters. I will argue that this rearrangement of deep water masses is dynamically connected to the expansion of summer sea ice around Antarctica. A simple theory will be introduced to suggest that these deep waters only came to the surface under summer sea ice, which insulated them from atmospheric forcing, and were weakly mixed with overlying waters, thus being able to store carbon for long times. I will show that this unappreciated link between the expansion of sea ice and the appearance of a voluminous and insulated water mass appear to be crucial in explaining the ocean's role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide on glacial-interglacial timescales.",

            "abstract": "Up until recently the orthopyroxenite ALH 84001 and basaltic breccia NWA 7034 were the only martian meteorites that did not fit within the common SNC types. However with the discovery of Northwest Africa (NWA) 8159, the diversity is expanded further with a third unique non-SNC meteorite type. The existence of meteorite types beyond the narrow range seen in SNCs is what might be expected from a random cratering sampling of a volcanically long-lived and geologically complex planet such as Mars. NWA 8159, a fine-grained, augite basalt, is a new type of martian meteorite, with SNC-like oxygen isotopes and Fe/Mn values, but having several characteristics that make it distinct from other known martian meteorite types. NWA 8159 is the only martian basalt type known to have augite as the sole pyroxene phase in its mineralogy. NWA 8159 is unique among martian meteorites in that it possesses both crystalline plagioclase and shock amorphized plagioclase, often observed within a single grain, the bracketing of plagioclase amorphization places the estimated peak shock pressures at >15 GPa and <23 GPa. Magnetite in NWA 8159 is exceptionally pure, whereas most martian meteorites contain solid-solution titano-magnetites, and this pure magnetite is a manifestation of the highest oxygen fugacity (fO2) yet observed in a martian meteorite. Although NWA 8159 has the highest fO2 of martian meteorites, it has a pronounced light rare earth (LREE) depletion pattern similar to that of very low fO2 basaltic shergottites such as QUE 94201. Thus NWA 8159 displays a striking exception to well documented correlation between fO2 and LREE patterns in SNC meteorites. Finally, NWA 8159 stands apart from other martian meteorites in that it has an an early Amazonian age that is not represented in the SNCs, ALH 84001, or the NWA 7034 pairing group. NWA 8159 appears to be from an eruptive flow or shallow intrusion that is petrologically distinct from shergottite basalts, and its crystallization age argues that it is also temporally distant from the known time interval of shergottite magmatic activity. The decoupling of fO2 and LREE from classic SNC correlations also argues that NWA 8159 was possibly derived from a different mantle/crust source region suggesting the existence of a geochemically heterogeneous martian interior.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of continental lithosphere deformation that control the formation and evolution of rift systems leading to continental breakup and the creation of divergent plate boundaries represent a long-standing problem in tectonics. Studies conducted in present-day rifted margins and their onshore fossil analogues reveal variable crustal architecture emphasizing the complex spatial and temporal evolution of rift systems. The Bay of Biscay and Pyrenees, at the transition between the Iberian and European plates, correspond to a Late Jurassic to Mid Cretaceous rift system. The transition from preserved oceanic and rift domains to the West to their complete inversion in the East enables the investigation of seismically imaged, drilled and exposed parts of a rift system. We combine observations from seismic reflection data, gravity inversion results and field mapping to identify and map former rift domains from the Bay of Biscay margins to onshore fossil analogues preserved in the Pyrenean orogen. The results of this mapping emphasize the existence of spatially disconnected and strongly segmented rift systems preserved along the paleo Iberian-European plate boundary. Based on their restoration, subsidence and deformation history, we illustrate the evolution of strain partitioning between them and present the implications at the scale of the Iberian-European plate boundary. The deformation history suggested is more complex than previously assumed, highlighting the polyphased evolution of this plate boundary. We propose that the onset of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rifting was partitioned between a set of distinct left-lateral transtensional rift systems. A plate kinematic reorganization at Aptian-Albian time resulted in the onset of seafloor spreading in the Western Bay of Biscay and extreme crustal and lithosphere thinning in intra-continental rift basins to the east. Finally, the results of this work may provide insights on: (1) processes preceding break-up and the initiation of segmented and strongly oblique shear margins, (2) the deformation history of nascent divergent plate boundaries, and (3) the kinematics of the southern North Atlantic and Alpine domain in Western Europe.",

ARTisticc’s goal is to apply innovative standardized transdisciplinary art and science integrative approaches to foster robust, socially, culturally and scientifically, community centred adaptation to climate change. The approach used in the project is based on the strong understanding that adaptation is:\n(a) still \"a concept of uncertain form”; (b) a concept dealing with uncertainty; (c) a concept that calls for an analysis that goes beyond the traditional disciplinary organization of science, and; (d) an unconventional process in the realm of science and policy integration.\nThe project is centered on case studies in France, Greenland, Russia, India, Canada, Alaska, and Senegal. In every site we jointly develop artwork while we analyzing how natural science, essentially geosciences can be used in order to better adapt in the future, how society adapt to current changes and how memories of past adaptations frames current and future processes. Artforms are mobilized in order to share scientific results with local communities and policy makers, this in a way that respects cultural specificities while empowering stakeholders, ARTISTICC translates these “real life experiments” into stories and artwork that are meaningful to those affected by climate change.\nThe scientific results and the culturally mediated productions will thereafter be used in order to co-construct, with NGOs and policy makers, policy briefs, i.e. robust and scientifically legitimate policy recommendations regarding coastal adaptation. This co-construction process will be in itself analysed with the goal of increasing arts and science’s performative functions in the universe of evidence-based policy making.\nThe project involves scientists from natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities, as well as artitis from the performing arts (playwriters, film directors) as well as the visual arts (photographs, designers, sculptor) working in France, Senegal, India, Russia, Greenland, Alaska, and Canada",

The data reported were accumulated from Titan passes Ta (October 2004) through T98 (February 2014) and now incorporate emission from all of Titan’s surface. The mapping will eventually include data at both low and high spatial resolution, while for the present we concentrate on only the low-resolution data that provide thermal polarization. These data are sufficient to examine not only surface effective dielectric constant but seasonal and diurnal surface temperature variations, which we compare with current CIRS results. The map of effective dielectric constant allows us to explore possible regional variations in surface properties and composition. Finally, these data allow us to understand the nature and magnitude of systematic errors in the map-making process, essential to interpreting both the present maps and the forthcoming high-resolution maps based on these.

            "abstract": "Temperature has been used for many years to characterize flow in fractured rock systems. Fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was adopted by the oil/gas industry over two decades ago for monitoring processes in deep fractured rock environments. Improvements in DTS system resolutions, methodology advancements, and improved data processing techniques have caused recent popularity for shallow fractured rock hydrogeologic applications. A powerful advance in DTS methodology is the use of response data collected during active cable heating. When applied to borehole applications active heating creates a thermal disequilibrium in the aquifer system that enhances the detection of groundwater flow. Active DTS has been applied to open borehole environments; however, characterization methods based on open borehole measurements are limited in that only the effects of unnatural flow (i.e. vertical cross-connection and redistribution of flow creating local, induced flows) can be observed. To characterize natural gradient flow processes borehole effects need to be minimized.\nThe literature shows borehole sealing using flexible impervious fabric liners creates a static water column in the well that eliminates the negative effects of cross-connection. Measurements in this sealed environment have been shown by others to be representative of natural gradient flow conditions, rather than the conditions created by the borehole short circuiting units or fractures with varying hydraulic head. A new method for flow system characterization using active DTS in sealed boreholes has been developed with excellent prospects for quantitation of natural gradient groundwater fluxes and related hydraulic properties. This project demonstrates the utility of using an analytical solution for calculating apparent thermal conductivities and natural gradient groundwater fluxes at depth-discrete intervals observed continuously along a borehole using active DTS. Groundwater flux data can then be used in conjunction with other site datasets (e.g. gradients) to estimate profiles of formation hydraulic properties including transmissivity.",

Zuccarello.\nThe aim was two-fold: first, to study degassing processes at Etna’s NE Crater (NEC); second, to investigate the activity at the eruptive fissure (EF) that opened at the base of the NEC in early-July 2014. Indeed, NEC is the main contributor to Etna’s gas release, and continuously generates infrasonic events: a result of its impulsive degassing regime. Moreover, the opening of the EF offered a unique opportunity to investigate the partitioning of energy and geophysical signals between degassing, explosive and effusive sources.\nThe field campaign involved coupled deployment of seismometers, microphones, thermopiles, a mini-UV scanner, FTIR spectrometer, SO2 camera systems, high-speed video cameras, thermal and visible cameras, gravimeters, tiltmeters, drones, laser HCl sensor, Lidar and satellite data. Moreover, this experiment gave the opportunity to test the prototype of a DIAL for volcanic CO2 sensing the first time in a volcanic environment. Gathered information were integrated with data simultaneously recorded by the permanent networks run by Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.\nPreliminary analyses show a promising return, which we hope will shed new light on the complex interplay between degassing and eruptive dynamics. Our objective is to contribute to a better understanding of the eruptive and degassing mechanisms, as well as the structure of Etna’s upper plumbing system.",

            "abstract": "Correlation of ambient seismic noise gives traces that are an approximation to the time-derivative of the Green's function between two recording stations. These empirical Greens functions often contain the incident surface-waves and backscattered waves, which can be migrated to image near-surface discontinuities and scatterers. Traditional migration approaches require an approximation of the near-surface velocity field and proper modeling of elastic waves to estimate the Green's functions from the source and receiver positions to every image-point. With dense passive seismic array acquisition and ambient noise cross-correlations, each station can be considered as both a virtual source and a receiver and near-surface scatterers can be imaged across the array using only the empirical Green's functions. This new imaging approach is referred to as natural migration because the Green's functions needed for migration are naturally estimated from the crosscorrelograms of recorded traces. The advantages of natural migration are that it does not require estimation of the near-surface velocity or modeling of elastic waves. In addition, natural migration simultaneously images both low- and higher-order scattering and mode converted waves. The disadvantage is that the image resolution is dependent on the distribution of seismic receivers. To validate this concept, natural migration is applied to crosscorrelograms of passive data recorded by the Long Beach array and the USArray. The resulting migration images highlight known discontinuities from tomography and correlate to prominent geological boundaries at two very different scales: (1) tectonic scale such as the edge of the Atlantic Plain Province in southeastern US and (2) regional scale structure in Long Beach, California. The migration images can be used along with tomography methods to improve structure sharpness in a model construction.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation is one of the ubiquitous and computationally hard problems in the Earth Sciences. In particular, ensemble-based methods require a large number of model evaluations to estimate the prior probability density over system states, and variational methods require adjoint calculations and iteration to locate the maximum a posteriori solution in the presence of nonlinear models and observation operators.\nQuantum annealing computers (QAC) like the new D-Wave housed at the NASA Ames Research Center can be used for optimization and sampling, and therefore offers a new possibility for efficiently solving hard data assimilation problems. Coding on the QAC is not straightforward: a problem must be posed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and mapped to a spherical Chimera graph.\nWe have developed a method for compiling nonlinear 4D-Var problems on the D-Wave that consists of five steps:\nEmulating the nonlinear model and/or observation function using radial basis functions (RBF) or Chebyshev polynomials.\nTruncating a Taylor series around each RBF kernel.\nReducing the Taylor polynomial to a quadratic using ancilla gadgets.\nMapping the real-valued quadratic to a fixed-precision binary quadratic.\nMapping the fully coupled binary quadratic to a partially coupled spherical Chimera graph using ancilla gadgets.\nAt present the D-Wave contains 512 qbits (with 1024 and 2048 qbit machines due in the next two years); this machine size allows us to estimate only 3 state variables at each satellite overpass. However, QAC’s solve optimization problems using a physical (quantum) system, and therefore do not require iterations or calculation of model adjoints. This has the potential to revolutionize our ability to efficiently perform variational data assimilation, as the size of these computers grows in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Based on the ratio of various trace-elements from coral cores, there is considerable evidence that the amount of sediment reaching the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, has increased since agricultural development commenced in the 1870’s. However, understanding the primary source and processes driving the increase in sediment delivery has been challenging due to the variable geology and episodic hydrology of adjacent catchments. This paper presents the results from several projects that use a range of measurement techniques all aimed at understanding the spatial and temporal changes in sediment yield from the Burdekin watershed, Australia. Cosmogenic nuclide analysis (10Be) was combined with contemporary sediment flux monitoring to help identify the high risk sub-watersheds. Particle size analysis of the sediment loads from the sub-watersheds has determined the primary source areas for the fine (clay) sediment fractions. Within the sub-watersheds, fallout radionuclides (137Cs, 7Pb and 7Be) showed that most of the fine sediment is coming from vertical channel walls (50%) or horizontal sub-surface soils (~42%). Changes to in-stream sedimentation rates, derived from OSL dating, suggest that sediment delivery to channels lags behind reductions to vegetative ground cover. Historical archives of remotely sensed ground cover data were then linked to animal stocking rates in the area. Together, these data sets help elucidate the often complex sediment delivery processes and provide a stronger link between grazing land management and sediment flux to the GBR. This study highlights the benefit of using a range of techniques and data sets to identify the major sediment sources in these highly variable systems. The implications for land management restoration, policy and investment are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh affects millions of people, as groundwater is the primary source of both drinking and irrigation water in the country. The arsenic is of geologic origin, naturally-occurring in the aquifer sediment. However, the source of organic carbon that fuels the microbial reactions responsible for mobilizing arsenic off the sediment and into the groundwater has been debated for over a decade. The outstanding question is whether this organic carbon is sedimentary carbon that was co-deposited when the aquifers were formed, or surface-derived organic carbon transported into the subsurface along with recharge water. The answer to this question has implications for managing the contamination problem.\nHere we present results of recent laboratory incubations of aquifer sediment with recharge waters collected from our field site in Bangladesh. The incubations revealed a hitherto undocumented pool of biodegradable sedimentary organic carbon. Despite the carbon being old (thousands of years), it was rapidly utilized by the native microbial population. The results imply that within the aquifer this pool of sedimentary organic carbon is largely unavailable to the microbial community, but that chemical and/or physical perturbations to the subsurface, induced, for example, by large-scale groundwater pumping or microbial activity, could mobilize this bioavailable organic carbon off the sediment. Currently, we are using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques to understand the initial character of the mobilized organic carbon in our incubation experiments, and to track how its composition changes over time as it is degraded by microbes. These efforts will help clarify the in situ processes that could destabilize the sedimentary organic carbon and identify the components that make the carbon biologically available. Collectively, our data suggest a possible role for both surface-derived and sedimentary organic carbon in fueling the microbial reactions that mobilize arsenic into groundwater: surface-derived carbon can stimulate microbial reactions that target the solid phase and destabilize bioavailable sedimentary organic carbon that can then fuel further microbial reactions (i.e., the “priming” hypothesis).",

            "abstract": "Tephra recovered by deep-sea drilling from forearc to backarc across the Mariana volcanic arc system record the last 34 million years of the Arc’s evolution. Major and trace element abundances and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope ratios have been determined for tephra with high temporal precision and an average resolution of ∼1 million years. Temporal variations of source-sensitive radiogenic isotopes and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) are decoupled from the steady trends of silica and other archetypical crust-forming major elements. Modeling confirms the temporal isotopic and elemental abundance trends are controlled by subducted slab and mantle sources. Pb and Sr fluxes can be linked to fluids from altered oceanic crust (AOC), Nd is influenced by contributions from the mantle wedge and partial slab melts, while Hf mostly derives from the subarc mantle. Most plausibly, the K2O increase and fluctuations thereafter can be linked to a collision of the Mariana Arc with the leading trace of the Cretaceous-aged Western Pacific Seamount Province. The Province is inferred to have arrived at the Mariana Trench at ∼15-16 Ma coincident with the termination of spreading in the Parece Vela Backarc Basin. A short period of slab melting followed, possibly induced by slab rollback that peaked at ∼8-9 Ma and ended with the incipient rifting in the Mariana Trough at ∼7 Ma. Individual periods of Arc formation (52-24, 22-11, and 10-0 Ma) are characterized by a distinctive melee of source materials which is not repeated through time. Mariana Arc crustal growth has occurred through the addition of predominantly mafic and silicic melts formed during relatively short time intervals traceable via the chemically-distinctive subducted slab inputs.",

            "abstract": "In 2016-17, Juno and Cassini Proximal will provide comparable large advances in our understanding of the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. Both will provide high accuracy gravity and magnetic field data, while Juno will in addition determine the water abundance deep in the Jovian atmosphere, essential for understanding of giant planet formation and the density of the outer envelope (needed to construct interior models). Although Jupiter and Saturn are both gas giants, they differ in important ways (magnetic field, strength of zonal flows, enrichment in heavy elements, and probably the distribution of helium within). The opportunity to contrast and compare will be invaluable. Juno and Cassini are expected to determine the gravity field to about a part in 109 though with different spatial coverage and with less accurate determination near the poles. The determination of Jupiter’s likely central concentration of heavy elements is particularly challenging because it is only a few percent at most of the total mass and yet important for understanding Jupiter’s formation, which in turn likely determined the architecture of our solar system. This determination will be done from gravity, water determination and magnetic field and also aided by advances in our understanding of material properties. The corresponding determination for Saturn may prove easier (because the heavy element enrichment is a larger fraction of the mass) though complicated by lack of knowledge of water abundance and the need to identify a more precise value for the deep rotation of the planet (difficult for Saturn because of the lack of a measurable magnetic dipole tilt thus far). For both planets, the higher harmonics of gravity will likely be controlled by differential rotation (the zonal flows) and this will tell us their depth, an issue of major interest in the dynamics of these bodies. The magnetic field structure for Jupiter will be determined to higher accuracy than the Earth’s core field (since Jupiter lacks the terrestrial crustal contamination and the dynamo region extends closer to the surface) and this will be invaluable for understanding dynamos and internal dynamics. Comparison to Saturn will perhaps explain the striking difference between the magnetic fields of the two planets.",

            "abstract": "Humans have hardened land-water boundaries in almost every delta they live on. Engineering includes stabilizing and embanking channels to protect from river floods, building dikes around islands and emerging bars to reclaim land, and putting up sea walls to protect from waves and storm surges. These measures aim to reduce the exchange of water and sediment between the distributary delta channel network and the adjacent deltaplain. To first order, armoring of deltas results in net elevation loss of the floodplain, due to subsidence, compaction and reduced aggradation. Here, we ask what are the mechanisms of aggradation in ‘armored’ deltas? How do aggradation patterns compare to more natural depositional patterns?\nWe analyze 2-week period aggregates of MODIS satellite data from 2000 onwards to map inundation patterns due to irrigation, river floods and storm surges for selected deltas. Using a MODIS band-ratio, we assess relative concentrations of suspended sediment in stagnant water on the floodplains.\nIn addition, we use a simple approach to route sediment through the delta distributary network based on the relative channel geometries. A depositional process model then calculates cross-channel sediment flux as an exponential decay function, and determines sediment deposition over inundated areas.\nStacked inundation maps show vast areas of deltaplains have flooded between 2000-2014, despite armoring channels with dikes, and coastlines with seawalls. Flooding is caused by overtopping of levees and more rarely by breaching and in those latter cases the flooded areas are often locally constrained. In Asian deltas, rice paddy irrigation with floodwater can be mapped even in the more distal floodplain. Our model predicts that inundated areas still receive significant amounts of fresh sediment, but that the pattern is more variable than in natural systems. Sparse in-situ observations of floodplain aggradation rates and storm surge deposits corroborate high, but localized sedimentation rates.",

Assessments of hazards and risks ultimately rely on incorporating this information into usable form, first for the scientists to interpret, and then for the public and relevant stakeholders. One important challenge is in building appropriate and efficient strategies to compare and interpret data from these exceptionally different datasets.\nThe White Island volcanic system entered a new eruptive state beginning in mid-2012 and continuing through the present time. Eruptive activity during this period comprised small phreatic and phreato-magmatic events in August 2012, August 2013 and October 2013 and the intrusion of a small dome that was first observed in November 2012. We examine the chemical and geophysical dataset to assess the effects of small magma batches on the shallow hydrothermal system. The analysis incorporates high data rate (100 Hz) seismic, and infrasound data, lower data rate (1 Hz to 5 min sampling interval) GPS, tilt-meter, and gravity data and very low data rate geochemical time series (sampling intervals from days to months). The analysis is further informed by visual observations of lake level changes, geysering activity through crater lake vents, and changes in fumarolic discharges.\nWe first focus on the problems of incorporating the range of observables into coherent time frame dependant conceptual models. We then show examples where high data rate information may be improved through new processing methods and where low data rate information may be collected more frequently without loss of fidelity. By this approach we hope to improve the accuracy and efficiency of interpretations of volcano unrest and thereby improve hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "Several authors have warned that climate scientists sometimes exhibit a tendency to “err on the side of least drama” in reporting the risks associated with fossil fuel emissions. Scientists are often reluctant to comment on the implications of their work for public policy, despite the fact that because of their expertise they may be among those best placed to make recommendations about such matters as mitigation and preparedness. Scientists often have little or no training in ethics or philosophy, and consequently they may feel that they lack clear guidelines for balancing the imperative to avoid error against the need to speak out when it may be ethically required to do so. This dilemma becomes acute in cases such as abrupt ice sheet collapse where it is easier to identify a risk than to assess its probability. We will argue that long-established codes of ethics in the learned professions such as medicine and engineering offer a model that can guide research scientists in cases like this, and we suggest that ethical training could be regularly incorporated into graduate curricula in fields such as climate science and geology. We recognize that there are disanalogies between professional and scientific ethics, the most important of which is that codes of ethics are typically written into the laws that govern licensed professions such as engineering. Presently, no one can legally compel a research scientist to be ethical, although legal precedent may evolve such that scientists are increasingly expected to communicate their knowledge of risks. We will show that the principles of professional ethics can be readily adapted to define an ethical code that could be voluntarily adopted by scientists who seek clearer guidelines in an era of rapid climate change.",

Sea level has been documented using several independent methods over the past 0.5 million years (Myr). Older periods, however, lack such independent validation; all existing records are related to deep-sea oxygen isotope (d18O) data that are influenced by processes unrelated to sea level. For deep-sea temperature, only one continuous high-resolution (Mg/Ca-based) record exists, with related sea-level estimates, spanning the past 1.5 Myr. We have recently presented a novel sea-level reconstruction, with associated estimates of deep-sea temperature, which independently validates the previous 0–1.5 Myr reconstruction and extends it back to 5.3 Myr ago. A serious of caveats applies to this new method, especially in older times of its application, as is always the case with new methods. Independent validation exercises are needed to elucidate where consistency exists, and where solutions drift away from each other. A key observation from our new method is that a large temporal offset existed during the onset of Plio-Pleistocene ice ages, between a marked cooling step at 2.73 Myr ago and the first major glaciation at 2.15 Myr ago. This observation relies on relative changes within the dataset, which are more robust than absolute values. I will discuss our method and its main caveats and avenues for improvement.",

            "abstract": "Basal ice temperature is a critical boundary condition for ice sheet models. It modulates the basal melt rate and sliding conditions, and also affects the ice hardness which alters the deformational velocity. Therefore, in order to obtain reliable estimates on the future mass loss of the ice sheets using numerical models, basal ice temperature is of paramount importance. In this study, the basal temperature and basal melt rate under the Greenland Ice Sheet are estimated using the Robin temperature solution. The analytical Robin solution is obtained by solving the heat conservation equation for steady state conditions, assuming that advection and diffusion are significant only in the vertical direction. In this study, the sensitivity of the basal temperature obtained from the Robin solution to changes in input parameters, including changes in atmospheric conditions, ice thickness, and geothermal heat flux is tested.\nAlthough the Robin solution is frequently used in glaciology, there has been no quantitative study to estimate the effect of neglecting the horizontal advection on basal temperatures in regions of higher velocity. Here, a two-dimensional model is applied to quantify the effect of horizontal heat advection on basal temperatures. Overall, horizontal heat advection lowers the basal temperature except in regions where surface mass balance gradients are negative along the flow. Comparing the results from the 2D temperature model to the Robin solution along multiple flowlines of the Greenland Ice Sheet suggest that the horizontal heat advection alters the basal temperatures by less than 3°C up to 30-45% of the flow distance away from the ice divide; at greater distances this difference increases rapidly. All simulations using the Robin solution predict substantial basal melting under the northeast drainage basin of the ice sheet. Our 2D model results also show that because of the negative surface mass balance gradient, horizontal heat advection increases the basal temperatures in the northeast basin. Our obtained map of basal melting area matches well with the radar detected basal water under the north and northeast drainage basins. However, low basal temperatures estimated at the Camp Century ice core location in the northwest of the ice sheet is in contrast with the radar observations.",

            "abstract": "Gravity and topography data including new results obtained from recent Cassini RADAR and Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observations suggest that Titan has a rigid and conductive crust, greater than 40 km in thickness (Beghin et al., 2012; Hemingway et al., 2013; Lopes et al., 2013; Mitri et al., 2014; Lefevre et al., 2014; Baland et al., 2014). In this work we employed rheological models based on clathrate hydrate stability fields and modeled geothermal gradients to investigate how clathrate hydrates may influence the rheology of Titan’s crust. Our findings suggest that a thick, rigid, and conductive crust composed of pure water ice is unlikely. Instead, a mixed phase crust comprised of water ice and clathrate hydrates, with up to 40 to 50% methane clathrates, results in thermal conductivity, viscosity, and density values consistent with Cassini observations. We modeled variations in Rayleigh number with crustal thickness for different crustal compositions assuming constant viscosity. Addition of methane clathrates makes the mixed ice-clathrate crust more viscous resulting in smaller Rayleigh numbers with depth compared to ice-only models. This slower rate of increase in Rayleigh number is also associated with increasing critical Rayleigh numbers, and hence, the potential thickness of a rigid, conductive crust. Modeling basal viscosity for different crustal compositions, following McKinnon (2006), we also determined that a methane clathrate-rich conductive crust would likely be much thicker (~60 km) than a non-convecting pure water-ice crust (~12 km). Titan’s carbon content constrained by different formation models (Tobie et al., 2012) shows that even a pure methane clathrate crust is possible. However, a pure methane clathrate crust is unlikely because it would be relatively thin, less than 20 km due to clathrate’s low thermal conductivity. Therefore, a mixed phase crust may explain both the geophysical observations and significant methane concentrations in Titan’s atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake rupture directivity is essential for studying seismic hazard and understanding seismogenic processes by resolving the ruptured fault. Point source approximation with centroid moment tensor (CMT) or fault plane solution only provides two nodal planes instead of specifying the physical rupture plane, thus leading to fault plane ambiguity. For mega-earthquakes (M7+), slip distribution can be resolved through finite fault modeling (Ji et al., 2002). For moderate earthquakes (M4~6), relative source time function (RSTF) can be obtained from deconvolving the empirical green's functions or forward modeling, and the rupture directivity can be determined from fitting RSTF of stations with small azimuth gap in a dense seismic network(Luo et al., 2010). But for sparse network, station azimuthal coverage is not sufficient for such studies.\nWe propose a technique to determine the rupture plane via measuring the spatial difference between centroid location and hypocenter. The technique involves of waveform time shift difference of mainshock and refer events (smaller events with similar focal mechanism), which calibrates errors due to velocity heterogeneity and absolute location error. Relative hypocenter locations and relative centroid locations are resolved by relative location method of onset travel times and waveform cross-correlation respectively. The difference between onset travel times and waveform-derived centroid times against the azimuthal variations is then used to infer the mainshock rupture directivity.\nWe apply the method to the 2008 Illinois Mw5.2 earthquake. Four M3.4+ aftershocks are chosen as refer events, we generate synthetics using focal mechanism from SLU earthquake center, and measure the time shift difference for stations. The resolved rupture plane strikes northwest-southeast, consistent with spatial distribution of relocated aftershocks using hypoDD (Hongfeng Yang et al., 2009). The method works for earthquakes of unilateral rupture, which consist of 80% of all earthquake as demonstrated by previous studies.",

            "abstract": "The exosphere of Mars is very extensive and the hot oxygen corona, produced photochemically in the ionosphere, extends tens of Martian radii from the planet. This exosphere is a source of oxygen ions, picked up by the solar wind electric and magnetic fields, and accelerated toward Mars. The pickup ion energies depend on solar wind conditions and during high speed solar winds (> 500 km/s) with large angles between the solar wind bulk flow velocity and the interplanetary magnetic field (> 50 degrees), oxygen pickup ions can reach energies high enough (> 60 keV) to be detected by SEP. The SEP (Solar Energetic Particle) instrument is an energetic particle detector on board the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft, scheduled to reach Mars in September 2014. In this study, the instrumental geometry and response function of SEP are included in a modeling analysis of the effect that different solar wind conditions and SEP look directions will have on O+ pickup ion energy spectra. We describe a method that provides constraints on neutral oxygen escape models by linking the SEP energy spectra to the photochemical source of hot oxygen. Additionally, we present model results for pick-up ion distributions, and their possible detection by the SEP, STATIC (SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition) and SWIA (Solar Wind Ion Analyzer) instruments on board MAVEN, during the close passage of Comet Siding Spring to Mars on October 19, 2014.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the ubiquitous oceanic crustal components in Cenozoic intra-continental basalts in eastern China (Zhang et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2012a, b). The main arguments in support of this include: (a) strong similarity of trace element patterns and Fe/Mn ratios of these continental basalts with respect to oceanic island basalts; (b) coupled high Fe2O3and water contents and low87Sr/86Sr ratio; (c) high d18O less than mantle values recorded in olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts; (d) pyroxenite-dominated source as constrained by comparison of olivine-hosted melt inclusions with experimental results. Whether these recycled oceanic components from the core-mantle boundary (CMB) or from the mantle transition zone is a matter of debate. In the case of eastern Asian continent, we favor for a provenance from the mantle transition zone given the following considerations: (a) Geophysical studies show a stagnantPacific slab within the mantle transition zone underneath the studied region. Such a sandwich structure prevailed at least since late Cretaceous thus ruling out the possibility that oceanic crustal components from the CMB; (b) Pb isotopes do not show the high time-integrated 238U/204Pb mantle component expectedfor a HIMU basalt, suggesting a young age of recycled components. (c) The same Indian MORB-like isotopiccomposition is found in the eastern China Cenozoic basalts and in the extinct Izanaghi–Pacific plate ofNWPacific. This suggests that the recycled oceanic components may have been derived from the seismically detected stagnantPacific slab within the mantle transition zone. We thus speculate that not all recycled oceanic components are carried to the surface by mantle plumes, but can be transported to the shallow level by other processes from the mantle transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Focused Ion beam assisted TEM studies of inclusions in diamond have opened up a new perspective on the Earth’s deep mantle processes. They enabled direct observation of fluids and have shown a large chemical and redox heterogeneity at the submicron scale, which is not observed in micron-sized inclusions. While crustal metamorphic diamonds are generally formed under oxidizing conditions, polycrystalline diamonds from the Earth's mantle and carbonado have inclusion suites reflecting variable, and sometimes extreme, redox conditions. Diamond fluid compositions, however, fall in the same compositional field for worldwide diamond fluids, regardless of their geodynamic environment. They conform with the fluid end-members established by studies on fibrous diamonds, suggesting a universally important role of a limited number of basic ingredients, namely carbonates, silicates, halides and water.\nStrong redox gradients reflected by the micro-inclusions indicate diamond precipitation via small-scale, ephemeral redox processes driven by the contrasting oxidation states of fluids and their depositional environment. The susceptibility of the melting point of mantle rocks to the presence of even small amounts of volatiles promotes melting simultaneous to diamond precipitation, which is further enhanced by the changing of fluid composition towards higher water activity. This creates a chemically heterogeneous environment, in which diamonds and their inclusions are precipitated via redox-freezing processes.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost represents about 50% of the total belowground global carbon pool, and thus the fate of this pool, as it thaws in the wake of global warming, warrants close attention. Large-river delta-front estuaries (LDEs) have been shown to be important recorders of natural and human-induced changes in watersheds, as they are critical zones for the exchange of organic carbon between the continents and the ocean. The Colville River is the largest North American Arctic River with a continuous permafrost watershed. Simpson’s Lagoon, an eastward distal component of the Colville River Delta is an excellent location for historical reconstruction work since it is an area well protected from intense ice grounding and has minimal bioturbation. Sediment cores were collected from the mouth of the river and the lagoon in August of 2010, and analyzed for bulk organic carbon and nitrogen proxies, biomarkers (including lignin phenols, fatty acids), and compound-specific 13C isotope analysis (CSIA) of fatty acids. Downcore sediment data from CSIA of short-chain fatty acids (C14-C18) to the delta over the past ca. 50 years were found to be more depleted and had a wider isotopic range (-17.0~-33.2‰) than long-chain fatty acids (C22-C30, -30.3~-36.8‰). This possibly reflects alterations of inputs of freshwater flow to the delta which could have resulted in isotopic changes that caused corresponding changes in marine versus freshwater phytoplankton inputs. Downcore short-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid profiles reflected differences in the abundance of bacteria and post-depositional decay of algal inputs across different regions of the delta. Ongoing analyses will also focus on compound-specific radiocarbon analyses (CSRA) of fatty acids and lignin phenols to better understand the changes of organic inputs from terrestrially-derived organic-rich horizons in surface soils vs. old deep permafrost-derived organic horizons.",

            "abstract": "It has been widely accepted that diffuse auroras are generated by electron precipitations in the energy range from a few keV to tens keV. Recent simulation results based on the quasi-linear theory showed that the scattering by whistler-mode waves plays an important role in the production of precipitating electrons responsible for diffuse auroras. A test particle simulation on electron-whistler interactions shows that relativistic electrons can be scattered into the loss cone simultaneously with the electrons in the energy range from a few keV to tens keV. Thus, it is expected that relativistic electrons precipitate into the atmosphere in association with diffuse auroras if whistler-mode waves contribute to generation of diffuse auroras. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated conjugate observations of SAMPEX and the all sky camera at Syowa Station on the dawn side, where diffuse auroras are frequently observed. In this study, we show a case study that relativistic electron (> 1 MeV) precipitations observed by SAMPEX are associated with the diffuse aurora observed at Syowa Station. The SAMPEX observation shows that the enhancement of precipitating relativistic electrons is well correlated with that of precipitating > 150 keV and > 400 keV electrons, indicating that electrons in the energy range from a few keV to > 1 MeV precipitate into the atmosphere simultaneously in association with the diffuse aurora. It is observational evidence that whistler mode waves contribute to generation of diffuse auroras.",

            "abstract": "Modern seismicity record along the Manila Trench shows only infrequent Mw7 earthquakes, the lack of great earthquakes may indicate the subduction fault is either aseismically slipping or is accumulating strain energy toward rapid release in a megathrust earthquake. We conduct numerical simulations of the plate coupling, earthquake nucleation and dynamic rupture propagation processes along the Manila subduction fault (15-19.5ºN), taking into consideration the effects of plate geometry (including subducted seamounts), fault strength, rate-state frictional properties and pore pressure variations. Specifically, we use the bathymetry to depict the outline of Manila trench along its strike, 2681 background seismicity (1970/02/13 to 2013/09/06) from Chinese Earthquake Network Center and 540 focal mechanism solutions (1976/01/01 to 2013/01/27) from Global CMT project to constrain the geometry of the subducting Sunda/Eurasian slab. The compilation of seismicity and focal mechanism indicates the plate dipping angle gradually changes from 28º (south of the Scaborough Seamount Chain) to 12º (north of it). This geometric anomaly may due to the subducted part of the seamount chain. Preliminary modeling results using gabbro gouge friction data show that the Scaborough Seamount Chain could be a barrier to earthquake rupture propagation. Only earthquakes larger than Mw7 can overcome the barrier to rupture the entire Manila trench. Smaller earthquakes would cease rupturing when it encounters the seamount chain. Moreover, we propose that Manila trench subduction zone has the potential of rupturing in a Mw8 megathrust earthquake, if the simulation period is long enough for an Mw8 earthquake cycle and dynamic rupture overcomes the subducted Scaborough Seamount Chain. Our model parameters will be further constrained by laboratory rock mechanics experiments conducted on IODP Expedition 349, South China Sea (SCS), drilling samples (work in progress at China Earthquake Administration Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamics), and by GPS records from the Luzon Island. Our results improve ability of earthquake and tsunami hazards assessment and mitigation in the populated regions around the SCS, and provide theoretical basis for future ocean bottom seismometer and seafloor geodesy experiments in the SCS.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic magnetic minerals produced by magnetotactic bacteria occur ubiquitously in natural aquatic environments. Their identification and characterization are important for interpretation of paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records. We compare two magnetic methods for their identification and characterization in a diverse set of sedimentary environments: ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy and first-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams, constrained by transmission electron microscope observations. The advantages and limitations of each method are evaluated. FMR analysis provides a strong diagnostic indicator because of its ability to detect the strong shape anisotropy that arises from the biogenic chain architecture, but it can be obscured in mixed magnetic mineral assemblages. We develop a new FMR fitting approach that enables separation and characterization of biogenic components in natural samples. FMR spectral fitting on magnetofossil-bearing samples does not always reveal a strong signature of biogenic magnetite with <111>-aligned chains, in contrast to whole MTB cells. This indicates that strictly <111>-aligned chains are not as common in magnetofossil assemblages, either due to chain collapse or different crystallographic axis orientations. FORC analysis provides an excellent tool for isolating the biogenic component as a ‘central ridge’ signature with peak switching field distribution between ~20 and 60 mT. We also analyzed tuff samples with similar FMR characteristics to biogenic magnetite chains, which can cause ambiguity. We propose a magnetic protocol to improve the robustness and efficiency of biogenic magnetite identification and past microbial activity in a wide range of environments.",

            "abstract": "Seismologists have now believed that the fault interface is characterized by the asperity-matrix structure, where the upper and lower plates are strongly coupled at the asperity, and the matrix, which surrounds the asperity, is deformed by creeping. Earthquakes are generated by dynamic rupture only in the non-creeping hard asperity, where the strain energy is accumulated if the asperity and matrix are mechanically coupled to a certain degree. In this presentation, we will argue that this structure is developed as brittle fracturing proceeds aided by dissolution-precipitation creep in particular at the brittle-ductile transition zone, which leads to the strength reduction and seimogenesis in both crust and subduction zones. We have been studying deformation processes and mechanisms in rocks at brittle-ductile transition conditions, based on microstructural analyses in naturally deformed rocks. For example, we reported that pervasive micro-faulting in the high-P/T Sambagawa quartz schist at brittle-ductile transition conditions, where a volume fraction of micro-shear zones consisting of both very-fine grained dynamically recrystallized quartz and white mica increased with increasing deformation (Takeshita and El-Fakharani, 2013). We believe that the resultant structure, “undeformed lenses surrounded by microshear zones” can be correlated with the asperity-matrix structure in the thin section scale, which could have occurred in the mesoscopic to macroscopic scales (cf. Schrank et al., 2008). It is inferred that the rocks became softened with increasing volume fraction of micro-shear zones, because dissolution-precipitation creep could have occurred at low differential stresses in the sheared zones. Further, cataclasites were formed along the Median Tectonic Line in the Cretaceous to Paleogene, where new minerals precipitated from fluids in the space created by fracturing at the conditions of brittle-ductile transition. The fracturing was accompanied by element migration via fluids, the degree of which increased with increasing degree of fracturing. In conclusion, deformation occurred by dissolution-mass transfer-precipitation assisted by fracturing under the conditions of brittle-ductile transition, by which significant weakening could have been generated in rocks.",

            "abstract": "Planetary surface mobility depends on lithospheric stresses arising from the mantle’s convective vigor. Using a model of thermochemical convection featuring force-balanced plates we examine the effect on surface mobility of different fractions of compositionally dense mantle material. Specifically, we introduce a uniform thickness compositionally enriched basal layer in a system with mobile-lid tectonics and monitor whether an active lid is subsequently maintained. We find that long-term surface mobility decreases when enriched material is present. High mobility is always maintained if the total material volume is no more than 1% of the mantle volume. For the inferred volume of the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the present-day Earth, surface mobility is dependent on the buoyancy ratio of the enriched material. If the compositionally dense material self-organizes into provinces, both surface mobility and mantle upwelling vigor become more variable. Generally, upwellings that form at the edges of provinces are more buoyant relative to upwellings that form on the tops of provinces. If enriched material envelops the core, upwelling vigor is diminished so that plates are consumed more quickly than they can fragment, and surface mobility is eventually lost.",

An opportunity to compare storm and tsunami sedimentary deposits was recognised following sediment deposition by Cyclone Thane (25th to 31st December 2011) that were superimposed on sediments deposited during the Indian Ocean Tsunami (26th December 2004) in a pit (DPM3a) near Cuddalore, on the south-eastern Indian coastline. A second pit, at Silver Beach (SB1) was located 2 km south of Pit DPM3a, was examined for comparison with Pit DPM3a.\nPit DPM3a contained four distinct units, an oldest intertidal unit, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, and a reworked aeolian sand that is capped by the Cyclone Thane deposit. Pit SB1 contained an oldest intertidal deposit, an estuarine beach and capped by the Cyclone Thane deposit. The identification of these units was verified from satellite imagery. The pits were examined at 1cm increments for grainsize and grain shape characteristics, loss on ignition, heavy mineral concentrations and microfossils.\nA suite of statistical analyses, including exploratory data analysis techniques, analysis of variance and principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to compare the measured parameters and the individual deposits within and between pits DPM3a and SB1. Individual deposits showed significant differences in many of the parameters, but no individual variable was diagnostic of the deposits. PCA of Pit DPM3a suggested that the proportion of heavy minerals was the strongest parameter to distinguish the storm deposit from the tidal, aeolian and tsunami deposit, but that significant overlap between the deposits occurred. The application of DFA showed that in Pit DPM3a, the storm deposit could be distinguished from the tsunami, tidal and aeolian deposits. However, applying the same data analysed from Pit SB1 showed a marked difference in unit characteristics, highlighting that the discriminant function models can only be applied to the training dataset (Pit DPM3a) and cannot be applied to nearby sites (e.g. Pit SB1).",

            "abstract": "Boreal forests are experiencing significant changes in climate and disturbance regimes, including increases in the frequency and severity of fires. Fires impact the carbon (C) cycle of this region in many ways, including through changes to C inputs to the ecosystem (i.e., loss of all living vegetation, followed post-fire regrowth), changes in mycorrhizal relationships, the altering soil temperature and moisture regimes, and the charring of surface organic soil. All of these factors have the potential to impact decomposition rates. We were interested in comparing the relative importance of changes in soil temperature and moisture (soil environmental conditions) versus surface organic soil quality (charring) on decomposition rates. To disentangle the effects of environmental factors versus charring on mass loss, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment. Our design included burned and unburned feather moss litter, collected from the field and placed within litterbags, which were then placed into triplicate burned and unburned black spruce dominated stands in interior Alaska. Litterbags were collected after one, three, and seven years, after which mass loss and changes in C and N pools were quantified. Exponential decomposition (k) values varied with litter type (burned/unburned) by environment (burned/unburned site) interactions. Averaged across both types of environments, decomposition rates were almost double for unburned versus burned litter. Decomposition rates were approximately 30 percent faster for unburned versus burned sites. Our results to date show that changes to soil quality due to charring have a larger effect in controlling post-burn decomposition rates than changes in soil environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Although Papua New Guinea is relatively young in geological terms, it lies in a complex tectonic setting of oblique convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates, and trapped between the converging Ontong Java Plateau of the Pacific plate and the Australian continent. This complex setting combined with a lack of regional quantitative datasets has led to uncertainty in the timing and nature of major terrane forming events. The Maramuni arc represents the only continuous record of the tectonic evolution of Papua New Guinea during the Miocene, and hence provides an opportunity to gain insight into subduction dynamics, orogenesis and crustal processes that operated throughout this dynamic period. We present an integrated U-Pb geochronology, Hf isotope and geochemical investigation of the Maramuni arc utilizing a suite of intrusive rocks from the eastern Papuan Highlands that span the Late Miocene from ca. 12 Ma to 6 Ma. Northward dipping subduction beneath Papua New Guinea and early Maramuni arc activity is disrupted by arrival of the Australian continent at the trench from 12 Ma. The magmatic rocks formed from ca. 12–9 Ma have compositional affinities of subduction-zone magmas, but record increasing incompatible trace element contents and decreasing εHf with time, which we interpret to reflect a progressive increase in the crustal component of the magmas. Subsequent porphyry suites emplaced at 7.5-6 Ma are distinct from the older magmatic rocks by their marked HREE-depletion, which reflects a dramatic shift in arc-mantle dynamics. This is interpreted as break-up of the subducted slab and crustal delamination, and is marked by a second phase of uplift in the New Guinea Orogen. These results provide insights into the processes of continent collision and the expression of such processes in the geological record with potential applications in ancient convergent margins.",

            "abstract": "Lignin as a biomarker in soils, peat, lakes and intertidal and marine sediment cores has been widely researched in the last four decades. The biogeochemical processes controlling their distribution and composition include fractionation due to phase changes, mineral binding, and abiotic and biotic decay. However, there appears to be no studies in the literature describing the concentration and composition of lignin in groundwater aquifers, despite lignin tracing having the potential to differentiate between types of vegetation and recharge source. In the latter case aquifers could potentially be a source of old, degradation resistant lignin. In this study, we characterise the lignin composition in groundwater samples from a coastal sand aquifer, in SE Australia. We compare these data with lignin composition of fresh vegetation samples from the study site, and with lignin data from other environments in the literature. Groundwater samples were also analysed for Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and inorganic chemistry (major ions, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and redox sensitive species) to investigate lignin fractionation processes. To achieve this, the groundwater lignin composition was compared to the total DOC and DIC in the samples and the prevailing redox reactions. The lignin composition in groundwater was found to be unrelated to the surrounding surface vegetation, indicating significant alteration by biogeochemical processes along its flow paths. We identify potential lignin degradation zones, via determination of total OC consumed through redox reactions and microbial activity. In conclusion, this study, by closely examining the correlations of lignin phenols in groundwater with lignin in surface waters, as well as biogeochemical processes in the aquifer is shedding a new light on the ability of lignin as a biomarker in these subsurface systems. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess the usefulness of lignin as a tracer in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography of subduction zones suggests that slabs of oceanic lithosphere can accumulate at the base of the mantle transition zone (MTZ), and primary mantle plumes originating in the lower mantle often pick up a geochemical signature of deeply recycled crust as they transit through the MTZ on their way to form hot-spot related chains of ocean-islands. Here we report the results of phase equilibria experiments on natural starting materials representative of \"continental sediment\" with variable amounts of H2O present (0.8, 3.3, and 6.0 wt%), carried out in the multi-anvil apparatus at pressures appropriate to the base of the MTZ (~23-24 GPa), and temperatures ~1200-1600°C. At the lowest H2O contents , the phase assemblage consists of K-hollandite (KAlSi3O8)+Ti-perovskite (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al,Ti)O3+Stishovite (SiO2)+Corundum (Al2O3)+H2O-Fluid, but in the presence of modest amounts of water (~3-6 wt%), K-hollandite and Ti-perovskite break down to form an assemblage comprised of potassic NAL-phase (KAlSiO4)+Stish+H2O-rich melt. This suggests that K-rich NAL-phase will form in deeply subducted continental material by a peritectic melting reaction of the general form: KAlSi3O8 ↔ KAlSiO4 + 2·SiO2. Ti-perovskite also participates as a reactant phase, and significant substitution of Fe, Mg, and Ti into the crystal structure of the new NAL-phase is observed. The reconstructed compositions of K-rich NAL-phase inclusions in (ultradeep) diamonds from the base of the MTZ closely resemble those of the potassic NAL-phases produced in our experiments, providing direct evidence for recycling of \"continental\" material to the base of the MTZ and a hydrous MTZ.\nThe elastic properties of K- and Na-bearing hollandite and NAL phases were also investigated using first principles simulations. Although preliminary calculations indicate that these phases have similar bulk and shear modulus at ambient conditions, the pressure derivative of the shear modulus for K-hollandite is lower than that for the K-NAL phase, due to the 2nd order phase-transition (from tetragonal to monoclinic space group symmetry) that K-hollandite undergoes at ~23-25 GPa. Thus, the breakdown of K-hollandite to NAL phase and stishovite is likely to cause an increase in the shear wave velocity of sediment lithologies at the base of the MTZ.",

            "abstract": "The Guerrero terrane composed of Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous arc assemblages, were drifted from the North American continental mainland during lower Early Cretaceous spreading in the Arperos back arc basin, and subsequently accreted back to the continental margin in the late Aptian. Although the accretion of the Guerrero terrane represents one of the major tectonic processes that shaped the southern North American Pacific margin, the stratigraphic record related to such a regional event was not yet recognized in central Mexico. Due to the Sierra de los Cuarzos is located just 50 km east of the Guerrero terrane suture belt, its stratigraphic record should be highly sensitive to first order tectonic changes and would record a syn-tectonic deposits related to this major event.\nIn that study area, were identified two main Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous clastic units. The Sierra de los Cuarzos formation represents the lowermost exposed stratigraphic record. Sedimentary structures, sandstones composition, and U-Pb detrital zircon ages document that the Sierra de los Cuarzos formation reflects a vigorous mass wasting along the margin of the North American continental mainland, representing the eastern side of the Arperos back arc basin. Sandstones of the Sierra de los Cuarzos formation are free from detrital contributions related to the Guerrero terrane juvenile sources, indicating that the Arperos Basin acted like an efficient sedimentological barrier that inhibited the influence of the arc massifs on the continental mainland deposits. The Sierra de los Cuarzos formation is overlain by submarine slope deposits of the Pelones formation, which mark a sudden change in the depositional conditions. Provenance analysis documents that sandstones from the Pelones formation were fed by the mafic to intermediate arc assemblages of the Guerrero terrane, as well as by quartz-rich sources of the continental mainland, suggesting that, by the time of deposition of the Pelones formation, the Arperos Basin was closed and the Guerrero terrane was juxtaposed to the continental domain. Based on these data, we interpret the Pelones formation as the record of the major crustal reorganization in central Mexico related to the inversion of the Arperos back arc basin and accretion of the Guerrero terrane to the continental mainland.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that, under the influence of planetary rotation, convective flows tend to have a two dimensional (2D) structure, with small variations along the direction of rotation. Because of the primary force balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force, such flows are termed geostrophic. Convective flows are never purely geostrophic because buoyancy (which powers convection) is necessarily present and so is viscous dissipation. Nevertheless, provided rotation is dominant, the first order 2D nature of convective flows is preserved and these flows are often referred to as quasi-geostrophic (QG). QG numerical models of thermal convection, in which only variations in axially averaged quantities are tracked, have been developed to take advantage of the predominant 2D structure of QG flows. These models can reproduce faithfully some of the features of fully three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The chief advantage of such QG models is that, because of their 2D nature, a much higher numerical resolution is achievable than for 3D models for the same computing cost and can thus be used to study aspects of convection under a regime not accessible to 3D models. In existing QG models, the buoyancy force is restricted to its component perpendicular to the rotation axis and the modelled region of convection is limited to that outside the tangent cylinder. Here, we present an extension on these models by incorporating the axial component of the buoyancy force and by modelling convection inside the tangent cylinder. Our model can reproduce the salient features of 3D numerical models near onset. Further, our model also captures features of well developed, fully turbulent convection, such as production of zonal jets.",

            "abstract": "Forearc basins are loci of active sedimentation above the landward portion of accretionary prisms. Although these basins typically remain separated from the frontal prism by a forearc high, their evolution has a significant impact on the structure and deformation of the entire wedge. Formation of forearc basins has been proposed as a consequence of changes in wedge stability due to an increase of slab dip in subduction zones. Another hypothesis attributes this to higher hinterland sedimentation, which causes the rear of the wedge to stabilize and eventually develop a forearc basin. Basin stratigraphic architecture, revealed by high-resolution reflection seismic data and borehole data allows interpretation of structural development of the accretionary prism and associated basins with the goal of determining the underlying driving mechanism(s) of basin formation.\nIn this study we supplement data interpretation with thermo-mechanical numerical models including high-resolution isochronal surface tracking to visualize the developing stratigraphy of basins that develop in subduction zone and wedge dynamic models. We use a dynamic 2D thermo mechanical model incorporating surface processes, strain weakening and sediment subduction. The model is a modification of I2VIS model, which is based on conservative, fully staggered finite differences and a non-diffusive marker- in-cell technique capable of modelling mantle convection. In the model different driving mechanisms for basin formation can be explored. Stratigraphic simulations obtained by isochronal surface tracking are compared to reflection pattern and stratigraphy of seismic and borehole data, respectively. Initial results from a model roughly representing the Nankai Trough Subduction Zone offshore Japan are compared to available seismic and Integrated Ocean Drilling (IODP) data. A calibrated model predicting forearc basin stratigraphy will be used to discern the underlying process of basins formation and wedge dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Temperature, melt fraction, and water content affect seismic velocity and attenuation differently. Both are sensitive to temperature, but velocity is more sensitive to melt fraction and attenuation is thought to be more sensitive to water content. For these reasons, combining attenuation measurements with tomographic imaging of velocity structure can help untangle these fields and better resolve lithospheric structure and physical state. We map variations in attenuation beneath Spain and northern Morocco using teleseismic data generated by more than a dozen teleseismic deep-focus earthquakes recorded on a dense array of stations. For each event, we first estimate the source from the best quality recordings. We then apply an attenuation operator to the source estimate, using a range of t* values, to match the record at each station. We invert for a smooth map of t* from the ensemble of measurements. The spatial patterns in t* correlate very well with the tectonic domains in Spain and Morocco. In particular, areas in Spain that resisted deformation during the Variscan and Alpine orogenies produce very little attenuation. Comparing the attenuation map with seismic velocity structure we find that, in Morocco, some areas with strong low-velocity anomalies and recent volcanism do not cause high attenuation. These observations suggest that water content is a more likely cause for seismic attenuation in the study area than temperature, and that the non-attenuative low-velocity anomalies in Morocco are produced by partial mel.",

            "abstract": "Pulsating aurora is a typical phenomenon of the recovery phase of magnetic substorm and is frequently observed in the morning sector. The widely accepted generation mechanism of pulsations in precipitating electrons is related to wave-particle interactions around the equatorial plane in the magnetospheric tail. This mechanism is completely different from the discrete-arc case, which generates high-energy auroral electrons by the inverted-V type potential structure in the magnetospheric acceleration region. This potential structure induces the perpendicular electric field. The electric field is mapped down to the ionosphere, and enhances the Pedersen current as the ionospheric closure current. Since the perpendicular electric field directly relates to the Joule heating rate and the Lorentz force, thermal and kinetic energies in the thermosphere are locally increased in the vicinity of the arc rather than the inside, resulting in wind variations in the thermosphere. However, this scenario cannot be simply applied to the pulsating-auroral case because of the completely different mechanism of the auroral-electron generation, and we have believed that large energies are not dissipated in the pulsating aurora and there should be no obvious wind variations in the thermosphere. However, we found thermospheric-wind variations in the pulsating aurora during simultaneous observations with a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (557.7 nm), several cameras, and incoherent-scatter radars. This is a significantly important finding in evaluating our understanding of the energy budget in the substorm recovery phase. As mentioned above, the Joule heating process and the Lorentz force play important roles for thermospheric-wind variations. While the both cases need enhancements of the perpendicular electric field, we well know that a typical level of the convection electric field is too low to generate the wind variations in a same level as the observed in the pulsating aurora. Thus the observed wind variation is a clear evidence that our estimation of the dissipated energy in the recovery phase has been underestimated. This presentation will summarize our measurements showing several events of the pulsating aurora, in particular focusing on the energy budget in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupled system.",

In the past, Heki (2006 GRL) detected ionospheric disturbances by the 2004 explosion of the Asama Volcano, central Japan, and Dautermann et al. (2009 JGR) studied the 2003 eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano in Montserrat, West Indies. Here we present new examples, and try to characterize such disturbances.\nWe first show TEC disturbances by the 2014 February Plinian eruption (VEI 4) of the Kelud volcano, East Java, Indonesia (Figure), observed with a regional GNSS network.The 2014 Kelud eruption broke a lava dome made by 2007 eruption and created a new creator. Significant disturbances were detected with four GPS and two GLONASS satellites, and the wavelet analyses showed that harmonic oscillations started at ~16:25 UT and continued nearly one hour. The frequency of the oscillation was ~3.8 mHz, which coincides with the atmospheric fundamental mode. We also confirmed concentric wavefronts, moving outward by ~0.8m/sec (stronger signals on the northern side). These features are similar to the 2003 Soufriere Hills case, although the signals in the present Kelud case is much clearer.\nNext, we compare them with ionospheric disturbances by Vulcanian explosions that occurred recently in Japan, i.e. the 2004 Asama case and the 2009 Sakurajima, and the 2011 Shin-moedake eruptions. They are characterized with one-time N-shaped disturbances possibly excited by the compression of the air above the vents. On the other hand, data from nearby seismometers suggested that atmospheric oscillations of various frequencies were excited by this continuous Plinian eruption. Part of such oscillations would have grown large due to atmospheric resonance.",

            "abstract": "Fresh water is essential to New Zealand’s economic, environmental, cultural and social well-being. In line with global trends, New Zealand’s freshwater resources are under pressure from increased abstraction and changes in land-use which contribute contaminants to our freshwater systems. Recent central government policy reform introduces greater national direction and guidance, to bring about a step-change in freshwater management. An existing national policy for freshwater management introduced in 2011 requires regional authorities to produce freshwater management plans containing clear freshwater objectives (measurable statements about the desired environmental state for water bodies) and associated limits to resource use (such as environmental flows and quantity allocation limits, and loads of contaminants to be discharged). These plans must integrate water quantity and quality management, consider climate change, and incorporate tangata whenua (New Zealand māori) roles and interests. In recent (2014) national policy amendments, the regional authorities are also required to implement national ‘bottom-line’ standards for certain attributes of the system to be managed; undertake accounting for all water takes and all sources of contaminants; and to develop and implement their plans in a collaborative way with communities. This rapid change in national policy has necessitated a new way of working for authorities tasked with implementation; many obstacles lie in their path. The scientific methods required to help set water quantity limits are well established, but water quality methods are less so. Collaborative processes have well documented benefits but also raise many challenges, particularly for the communication of complex and often uncertain scientific information. This paper provides background on the national policy changes and offers some early lessons learned by the regional authorities implementing collaborative freshwater management in New Zealand.",

            "abstract": "Twenty-two lives were lost in the Lockyer Creek floods in southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia in the summer of 2011. The predicted average recurrence interval (ARI) for this event in the upper catchment was ~ 2000 yrs based on relatively short gauging station records (median 38 yrs in Eastern Australia). This study presents an assessment of the basin-scale (3000km2) spatial patterns of floodplain erosion, deposition, and net morphological change following the January 2011 using multitemporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEMs. Clear spatial patterns of floodplain deposition and erosion are evident reflecting high degrees of variability in channel capacity and floodplain inundation frequency. This data is then compared to a millennial-scale record of floodplain deposition from six key reaches of the Lockyer Valley determined using extensive stratigraphic and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. OSL samples were taken from both bedrock and alluvial reaches and from both floodplain and within-channel benches. This presentation discusses the resultant spatial and temporal dynamics of floodplain deposition in a catchment dominated by hydrological extremes. The results highlight some important considerations of preservation potential in floodplain reconstruction but also provide data to test key hypotheses with respect to flood reconstruction in south eastern Australia.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics are strongly coupled and controlled by soil nutrients status. Nutrient availability serves as an indicator of aboveground carbon productivity and ecosystem stability, especially when soils are infertile. In these conditions, plants have to outcompete microorganism and mineral surfaces to acquire nutrients required for photosynthesis, respiration, seed production, defense, etc. It is usually hypothesized that microbes are short-term winners but long-term losers in nutrient competition. Microbes quickly trap available soil nitrogen and phosphorous, thereby preventing nutrient inaccessibility through hydrological leaching and mineral surface adsorption. Over longer temporal scales, nutrients are released into the soil and become available for plant uptake.\nDespite its ecological significance, nutrient competition is either absent or over-simplified (e.g., assuming all consumers are equally competitive) in terrestrial biogeochemistry models. Here, we aim to test the representation of different competitive strategies and to investigate their ecological consequences with a newly developed biogeochemical model structure. The new model includes three major soil nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate) and multiple consumers (plants, microbes, mineral surfaces, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers). We analyze predicted soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics with three different competitive strategies: (1) plants compete poorly against microorganisms; (2) all consumers are equally competitive; and (3) an explicit Equilibrium Chemical Approximation (ECA; Tang and Riley (2013)) treatment.\nWe find that very different ecosystem states are predicted when assuming different competitive structures, and that the ECA approach provides the best match with a large suite of observational constraints from tropical experimental and transect studies. We conclude that terrestrial biogeochemical models should represent a competitive structure that includes dynamic individual component representation of (1) nutrient stoichiometries; (2) affinities for nitrogen and phosphorous; and (3) abiotic interactions.",

            "abstract": "Biochar’s effects on improving soil fertility, enhancing crop productivity and reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission from croplands had been well addressed in numerous short-term experiments with biochar soil amendment (BSA) mostly in a single crop season / cropping year. However, the persistence of these effects, after a single biochar application, has not yet been well known due to limited long-term field studies so far. Large scale BSA in agriculture is often commented on the high cost due to large amount of biochar in a single application. Here, we try to show the persistence of biochar effects on soil fertility and crop productivity improvement as well as GHGs emission reduction, using data from a field experiment with BSA for 5 crop seasons in central North China. A single amendment of biochar was performed at rates of 0 (C0), 20 (C20) and 40 t ha-1 (C40) before sowing of the first crop season. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were monitored with static closed chamber method throughout the crop growing season for the 1st, 2nd and 5th cropping. Crop yield was measured and topsoil samples were collected at harvest of each crop season. BSA altered most of the soil physic-chemical properties with a significant increase over control in soil organic carbon (SOC) and available potassium (K) content. The increase in SOC and available K was consistent over the 5 crop seasons after BSA. Despite a significant yield increase in the first maize season, enhancement of crop yield was not consistent over crop seasons without corresponding to the changes in soil nutrient availability. BSA did not change seasonal total CO2 efflux but greatly reduced N2O emissions throughout the five seasons. This supported a stable nature of biochar carbon in soil, which played a consistent role in reducing N2O emission, which showed inter-annual variation with changes in temperature and soil moisture conditions. The biochar effect was much more consistent under C40 than under C20 and with GHGs emission than with soil property and crop yield. Thus, our study suggested that biochar amended in dry land could sustain a low carbon production both of maize and wheat in terms of its efficient carbon sequestration, lower GHGs emission intensity and soil improvement over 5 crop seasons after a single amendment.",

            "abstract": "The oceanic iron cycle is estimated by optimizing a simple steady-state model based on a data-assimilated global circulation, with a prescribed optimized phosphorus cycle and a prescribed aeolian source pattern. Key biogeochemical parameters are determined by minimizing a suitably weighted quadratic misfit between the model’s dissolved iron concentration and a global data set of sparse measurements. The global dissolved iron inventory is estimated to be (7.1±0.1)×1011 mol Fe, of which (6.9±0.1)×1011 mol Fe is bound to organic ligands and hence bioavailable, while the remainder is “free” iron. The aeolian iron input rate is estimated at (3.3±0.5)×109 mol Fe/year, corresponding to a bulk residence time for bioavailable iron of 215±40 years, comparable to the bulk biological cycling timescale estimated at 246±24 years. Iron limitation is quantified in terms of the difference [Fe∗] between the actual iron concentration and that needed to utilize the available phosphate. The optimized model captures the observed high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the ocean as iron-limited regions with [Fe∗]<0. We define an iron age, ΓFe, as the mean time since iron at a given point was last injected from the atmosphere and compute ΓFe using an equivalent linear formulation of the model. In the euphotic zone, ΓFe ranges from a few decades or less in regions of high aeolian input to ∼1800 years in the Southern Ocean. The patterns of ΓFe show that iron is supplied to the Southern Ocean euphotic zone primarily from depth rather than being advected within the thermocline following deposition from continental dust plumes. Because [Fe∗] is negative in the deep southern oceans, upwelling waters maintain Southern Ocean iron limitation.",

            "abstract": "The subaerial part of the Hikurangi Accretionary Prism (HAP) has nearly 330 sources of saline waters (2000-26000 mg/kg Cl), SO4-rich waters, CH4-rich gases and occasional oil seeps discharging from springs, mud volcanoes and gas vents from -37.5o to -41.3o latitude, 80-100 km from the subduction margin. Discharge areas, occupying <0.01 to 11 ha each, form a band about 500 km in length with widths ranging from 25 km in the south to 75-100 km in the north and centre. All fluid discharges are cold except for two hot springs in the central and N segments and another 6 on the W margin of the HAP. The total flow rate along the HAP is at least 10 x 108L/a, with nearly 50% contributed by cold discharges.\nMost fluid manifestations emerge along NE-trending faults and minor structures such as anticlines and synclines. However in the N, where fluids are also discharged along NW- and EW-trending structures within the allochton, manifestations are relatively more abundant (>150 sites), discharging nearly 45% of the annual surface fluid volume along the HAP.\nFluid discharges in the HAP, based on chemical and isotopic fluid compositions, consist of subducted waters derived from clay water of hydration (<50%) and seawater that had interacted at varying degrees with organic-containing sedimentary rocks at depth at different temperatures. Discharges from the central segment exhibit the lowest degree of water-rock interaction and have the highest inferred subsurface temperatures (median: 110oC compared to S at 80oC and N at 90oC), suggesting (1) more recent influx of subducted waters and (2) more rapid upflow of fluids from depth, relative to the S and N. Fluids in the S segment exhibit the highest degree of water-rock interaction suggesting longer residence time at depth, or slower fluid movement to the surface due to thicker crust or greater fluid channel tortuosity. The high concentration of isotopic He in the central and N fluids can be due to deep and highly permeable faults that channel mantle gases and also allow waters to rise very rapidly from as deep as the fracture zone between the overriding and down going plates. Fluid compositions indicate that the youngest fluids are rapidly expelled in the central and N segments although the latter is complicated by the presence of inherited allochton fluids.",

            "abstract": "The largest glacier changes are primarily observed in settings where ice flows into a proglacial water body. However, the responses to this interaction are not uniform. Rapidly retreating glaciers can occur in close vicinity to advancing ones. Calving styles and glacier morphologies vary greatly as well. Temperate lake-calving glaciers frequently exhibit floating tongues; but this is rarely observed on temperate tidewater glaciers. Calving styles range from mostly sub-aerial calving to full-thickness calving to slow detachment of large ice bergs. \nIn addition to the more obvious mechanical calving, glaciers lose mass at their termini through sub-aqueous melting. Melt rates of submerged ice have been shown to vary over several orders of magnitudes, and can range up to several meters per day. This large range is a consequence of different proglacial water temperatures, and of different modes of water transport. Water convection in proglacial water bodies can be driven by winds and tides, but subglacial water discharge is commonly the strongest and most variable driver. Here we attempt to relate the variability of forcings and melt rates to the various morphologies and calving styles of different water-terminating glaciers. The highest melt rates are observed at low-latitude tidewater glaciers, where ocean water can be warm (7 – 10 deg C) and subglacial discharge high. In such settings, sub-aqueous melt can reach the same magnitude as ice flux delivered to the terminus and it can control ice terminus position. Polar tidewater glaciers, such as those in Greenland, often exhibit floating tongues. Although melt rates are likely much lower, they can have a large effect under a floating tongue because of the much larger exposure of ice to water. Changes in melt rates can therefore affect the stability of such floating tongues. Low melt rates occur at some ice shelves at high latitudes, where the temperature and freshwater forcings are small. This situation can also occur at temperate lake-calving glaciers, which often flow into lakes of near freezing temperatures. Due to the very small density differences between subglacial discharge and ambient lake water, convection below the floating tongue is minor or non-existent.. This is in great contrast to fresh water entering a saline environment.",

            "abstract": "Semi-volatile organic species (SVOC) can condense on suspended particulate materials (PM) in the atmosphere. The modeling of condensation/evaporation of SVOC often assumes that gas-phase and particle-phase concentrations are at equilibrium. However, recent studies show that secondary organic aerosols (SOA) may not be accurately represented by an equilibrium approach between the gas and particle phases, because organic aerosols in the particle phase may be very viscous. The condensation in the viscous liquid phase is limited by the diffusion from the surface of PM to its core. Using a surrogate approach to represent SVOC, depending on the user’s choice, the secondary organic aerosol processor (SOAP) may assume equilibrium or model dynamically the condensation/evaporation between the gas and particle phases to take into account the viscosity of organic aerosols. The model is implemented in the three-dimensional chemistry-transport model of POLYPHEMUS. In SOAP, activity coefficients for organic mixtures can be computed using UNIFAC for short-range interactions between molecules and AIOMFAC to also take into account the effect of inorganic species on activity coefficients. Simulations over Europe are performed and POLYPHEMUS/SOAP is compared to POLYPHEMUS/H2O, which was previously used to model SOA using the equilibrium approach with activity coefficients from UNIFAC. Impacts of the dynamic approach on modeling SOA over Europe are evaluated. The concentrations of SOA using the dynamic approach are compared with those using the equilibrium approach. The increase of computational cost is also evaluated.",

            "abstract": "After almost 3.5 years of quiescence, Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) produced a small summit eruption on 20 June 2014 at 21:35 (GMT). The eruption lasted 20 hours and was preceded by:\ni) onset of deep eccentric seismicity (15-20 km bsl; 9 km NW of the volcano summit) in March and April 2014;\nii) enhanced CO2 soil flux along the NW rift zone;\niii) increase in the number and energy of shallow (<1.5 km asl) VT events.\nThe increase in VT events occurred on 9 June. Their signature, and shallow location, was not characteristic of an eruptive crisis. However, at 20:06 on 20/06 their character changed. This was 74 minutes before the onset of tremor. Deformations then began at 20:20.\nSince 2007, PdF has emitted small magma volumes (<3 Mm3) in events preceded by weak and short precursory phases. To respond to this challenging activity style, new monitoring methods were deployed at OVPF. While the JERK and MSNoise methods were developed for processing of seismic data, borehole tiltmeters and permanent monitoring of summit gas emissions, plus CO2 soil flux, were used to track precursory activity. JERK, based on an analysis of the acceleration slope of a broad-band seismometer data, allowed advanced notice of the new eruption by 50 minutes. MSNoise, based on seismic velocity determination, showed a significant decrease 7 days before the eruption. These signals were coupled with change in summit fumarole composition.\nRemote sensing allowed the following syn-eruptive observations:\n- INSAR confirmed measurements made by the OVPF geodetic network, showing that deformation was localized around the eruptive fissures;\n- A SPOT5 image acquired at 05:41 on 21/06 allowed definition of the flow field area (194 500 m2);\n- A MODIS image acquired at 06:35 on 21/06 gave a lava discharge rate of 6.9±2.8 m3 s-1, giving an erupted volume of 0.3 and 0.4 Mm3.\n- This rate was used with the DOWNFLOW and FLOWGO models, calibrated with the textural data from Piton’s 2010 lava, to run lava flow projections; showing that the event was volume limited.\nPreliminary sample analyses suggest that the olivine rich lavas have a differentiated character (melt MgO: 5.8 - 6.2 wt.%); proof of chamber residence. However, some aphyric tephra are more primitive (MgO: 8.2 wt.%). This suggests eruption due to injection of a small volume of new magma that destabilized an old magma pocket.",

            "abstract": "The key computational kernel of most advanced 3D seismic imaging and inversion algorithms involves calculating solutions of the 3D acoustic wave equation, most commonly with a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methodology. While well suited for regularly sampled rectilinear computational domains, FDTD methods seemingly have limited applicability in scenarios involving irregular 3D domain boundary surfaces and mesh interiors that are best described by non-Cartesian geometry (e.g., surface topography). Using coordinate mapping relationships and differential geometry, a FDTD approach can be developed for generating solutions to the 3D acoustic wave equation that is applicable to generalized 3D coordinate systems and (quadrilateral-faced hexahedral) structured meshes. The developed numerical implementation is similar to established Cartesian approaches, save for a necessary introduction of weighted first- and mixed second-order partial-derivative operators that account for spatially varying geometry. The approach is validated on three different types of computational meshes: (1) an ``internal boundary'' mesh conforming to a dipping water bottom; (2) analytical ``semi-orthogonal cylindrical\" coordinates; and (3) analytic semi-orthogonal and numerically specified ``topographic\" coordinate meshes. Impulse response tests and numerical analysis demonstrate the viability of the approach for kernel computations for 3D seismic imaging and inversion experiments for non-Cartesian geometry scenarios.",

The dominant fast polarization orientation is NW-SE for the Hungarian part of the stations as well as at the stations located in the easternmost of the Pannonian Basin. This orientation matches well with the anisotropy structure under the Eastern Alps, which has been attributed to asthenospheric flow. The NW-SE trend turns more into WNW-ESE at the stations situated in Austria, mostly NW of the Vienna basin. Apart from predominately NW-SE fast orientation, there are a few measurements showing NE-SW and almost E-W trend. The SKS measurements most likely originate mainly from the asthenosphere and consequently past (Miocene) asthenospheric flow in the upper mantle may still have a significant contribution to the fast azimuth directions, however, the effect of other factors cannot be excluded.\nXenoliths from the deeper lithospheric mantle have LPO structures of minerals as A-type of olivine in which the fast axis azimuth may correspond to the shear direction, possibly present-day asthenospheric flow in the upper mantle. Large delay times (>1.0 s) might also show the contribution of asthenosphere origin of anisotropy. Considering anisotropy magnitude between 5 to 6% from petrological measurements, and 1.0 s delay time would refer to 100 to 75 km thickness of the anisotropy layer.",

            "abstract": "According to the IPCC reports, the concentration of CO­2 has been increasing and projected to be increased significantly in future (IPCC, 2012). This can have significant impacts on climate. For instance, Dairaku and Emori (2006) examined over south Asia by doubling CO2 and documented an increase in precipitation intensities during Indian summer monsoon. This would increase natural disasters such as floods, landslide, coastal disaster, erosion etc. Recent studies investigated whether the rate of increase of extreme precipitation is related with the rate expected by Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship (approximately 7% per degree temperature rise). In our study, we examine whether this rate can increase or decrease in the future regional climate scenarios over Japan. We have analysed the ensemble experiments by three RCMs(NHRCM, NRAMS, WRF) forced by JRA25 as well as three GCMs (CCSM4, MIROC5, MRI-GCM3) for the current climate (1981-2000) and future scenario (2081-2100, RCP4.5) over Japan. We have stratified the extreme (99th, 95th, 90th, 75th percentile) precipitation of daily sum and daily maximum of hourly precipitation intensities of wet events based on daily mean temperature in bins of 1°C width for annual as well as for each season (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). The results indicate that precipitation intensity increases when temperature increases roughly up to 22 °C and further increase of temperature decreases the precipitation intensities. The obtained results are consistent and match with the observation (APHRODITE dataset) over Japan. The decrease of precipitation at higher temperature mainly can be found in JJA. It is also noticed that the rate of specific humidity is estimated higher during JJA than other seasons. The rate of increase of extreme precipitation is similar to the rate expected by CC relation except DJF (nearly twice of CC relation) in current climate. This rate becomes to be significantly larger in future scenario for higher temperatures than in current climate.\nAcknowledgement: This study is conducted as part of a research at NIED, Japan (PI: Koji Dairaku) of Research Program on Climate Change Adaptation (RECCA) and was supported by the SOUSEI Program, funded by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Government of Japan.",

            "abstract": "Warming trends are expected to reduce mountain snow pack, increase evapotranspiration, and thus diminish the sometimes limited water supplies of many intermountain streams and rivers. While it is believed that water that is transpired is no longer available for streamflow, it remains uncertain how the timing and quantity of transpiration differ between snow-dominated and rain-dominated elevations, and how alterations in transpiration in these regions affect surface water flow in mountain stream networks. To understand the spatiotemporal relationships of transpiration, we measured Douglas fir water use across the snow-rain transition line/elevation in the Pioneer Creek watershed of Idaho’s Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in 2014. We also recorded stream discharge and monitored surface flow areal extent in four subwatersheds with contrasting geomorphologic controls on the channel network, including moraine and fault controls. We sought to test the hypotheses that (1) Douglas fir trees at snow-dominated elevations would transpire less water each year, and do so later in the melt-season compared to Douglas fir trees at rain-dominated elevations, and (2), that patterns of stream network expansion and contraction will reflect patterns of timing in transpiration rates. Preliminary analyses suggest that transpiration timing is similar across all elevations, and that stream network extent varies minimally across a 20 to 60% variation in streamflow. Summer transpiration varied more strongly with tree size and age than with elevation. We present comparisons of drainage density across the sites at different flow rates, and relate them to geomorphic controls present within each basin. Understanding the present relationships of streamflow with transpiration across snowline contributes to more robust predictions of changes in water resources as a result of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Glacier mass balance forms a vital link between climate change and glacier dynamics and hydrology, and its variation is the best way to infer climate change from glaciers. The Altai Mountains are located in the southern periphery of the Asian Arctic basin and the most northern periphery of the central Asia mountain system, which contains 1280 glaciers covering an area of 1191 km2. These glaciers are at the headwaters of many prominent rivers, which affects the water discharge of large rivers such as the Ob and Yenisey rivers. Although several studies have been proposed for glacier changes in this region based on satellite data, so far no study focuses on glacier mass change in the whole Altai Mountains. Therefore, we implement a temperature-index-based glacier model that considers the glacier area evolution and the refreezing of meltwater, to reconstruct glacier mass balance of the Altai Mountains, forcing the model by a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations with 5-km resolution and glacier inventory data. Compared to available observed mass balances on three glaciers of this region, the model can reproduce reasonably well the decadal glacier mass changes. According to our calculations, the glaciers in the whole region show a mean annual balance of -0.8 m water equivalent per year over the period 1988-2012. Most Altai glaciers have experienced negative net surface mass balance over the study period, especially in the western part of the Altai Mountains. In addition to rising temperature, decreased precipitation in the western part of the Altai Mountains and increasing precipitation in the eastern part is probably driving these systematic differences.",

            "abstract": "Based on the method FMNEAR, we propose an approach to discriminate the fault plane (FP) from the auxiliary one for earthquakes down to Mw 3.8 using a minimum of 6 local strong motion records. Faulting characteristics and source time function (STF) are also determined.\nIn a first step, a precise focal mechanism (FM) is computed with all representative solutions. Then, in a second step, fault length and maximum duration of the STF are tested on all best solutions defined previously. The discrimination of the FP is finally performed with a local grid search on best FM solutions (on strike and dip) using the best fault length and STF duration.\nWe obtain by this way a refined geometry of the FP with its corresponding fault slip distribution. The resulting slip map gives directly access to rupture dimension and rupture characteristics (directivity, rake variation, slip patches). For each event, location and depth are tested, a 1D velocity model is defined for each station and Mw is provided. Synthetic tests are performed at each step of the approach in order to confirm its reliability.\nThis approach is tested in the Longitudinal Valley (eastern Taiwan) where a dense network of stations is available and monitor the high activity generated by the plate boundary of the ongoing Taiwanese orogen. The final goal of this approach, will be to retrieve 3D geometry of active and secondary structures thanks to small to moderate earthquakes. In addition to geometry, rupture characteristics will be available for each fault portion as well as any time / location variation of those characteristics.",

The \"MUlti-PUrpose probe for surface and sub-surface Science\" MUPUS will measure the temperature profile up to a depth of 30cm and the thermal conductivity using a self-penetrating needle-probe, the surface brightness temperature using a radiometer, the hardness of the comet soil by measuring the progress of insertion of the probe and the deceleration of the two anchors that will be shot to fix the lander. The anchors are equipped with an accelerometer and a temperature sensor each. The self-penetrating needle-probe, or penetrator for short, has an electro-magnetically driven hammer mechanism on top and a rod of about 1cm diameter and 32cm length equipped with 16 temperature sensors that can also be heated with controlled power of up to 2W to measure the thermal conductivity. MUPUS is stored on the lander but will be deployed to a distance of about 1m from the lander using a motor driven deployment device that extends from the lander balcony. The science goals of the instrument are to measure the temperature profile in the near surface layers of the comet and the heat flow into the comet nucleus to complement the surface energy balance of the nucleus with a quantity that is difficult to measure remotely or to estimate. The thermal conductivity can be further used to characterize the near surface layers and possibly determine the depth to pristine ice. The first science sequence will allow for insertion of the probe and for a first series of temperature and thermal conductivity measurements. MUPUS is looking at the long-term science sequence to complement these data. At the AGU fall meeting – assuming a successful landing and installation of the probe - we will report on results from the first science sequence.",

This particularity is already being observed currently and is also simulated by climate models. Feedback mechanisms associated with this particularly strong warming, or Artic Amplification, are multiple. The relative role of the different feedbacks are not easy to evaluate precisely using direct model outputs. In this study, we use the “radiative kernels” method (Soden et al, 2008) to perform a multi-model intercomparison analysis. The radiative decomposition is performed at the surface instead of the top of atmosphere in order to consider surface temperature changes specifically. The kernels are derived from the MIROC3.2 model. The intercomparison includes 32 CMIP5 coupled models, whose outputs are analyzed for changes from the late 20th to the late 21st centuries following the rcp4.5 scenario. We consider results separately for land and oceanic surfaces, as the mechanisms and orders of magnitude differ substantially for these two types of surface. We also consider seasons separately as we show that seasonality in the feedback processes is determinant.",

            "abstract": "The increase of 9‰ of the lithium isotope composition of the ocean since 60 Ma has been interpreted as reflecting a change of the silicate weathering regime with more rapid CO2 consumption due to increased tectonic uplift (Misra and Froelich, 2012). However, the small number of case studies limits our current understanding of the parameters controlling the Li isotope composition of large rivers discharging to the ocean. To characterize Li isotope fractionation at the continental scale, we report the Li isotope composition of river-borne material in the largest Earth’s River system, the Amazon River basin. The sample set includes rivers from various geomorphological settings, notably rivers draining the Andes and the lowlands. As a result of silicate weathering, the Li isotope composition (δ7Li ) of the dissolved load is fractionated toward heavy values (from +1.2 to +32‰) compared to the upper continental crust (0 - 2‰) and the suspended sediments (-6.8 to -0.5‰). We show that despite having very contrasted weathering and erosion regimes, both Andean headwaters and lowland rivers share a similar range of Li isotope composition (+1.2 up to +18‰). The correlation of the dissolved δ7Li with the Li/Na and with the Li/Mg ratios suggests that the fraction of Li incorporated in secondary minerals during weathering is the main parameter controlling the Li isotope composition at the whole Amazon basin scale. Both Rayleigh distillation and batch fractionation models satisfactorily explain the data with fractionation factors between weathering products and dissolved load ranging from 0.982 to 0.991. The fraction of Li incorporated in secondary minerals is controlled by the weathering regime and therefore is linked to the denudation rates. However, we show that Li incorporation in floodplains also influences the δ7Li of rivers at their mouth. These results have important implications for the understanding of past ocean δ7Li and stress the need to characterize at the global scale what are the parameters controlling the proportion of Li incorporated in secondary minerals.",

            "abstract": "The vast majority of phenological studies address questions relative to the spatial or temporal variability of phenological timings integrated at the forest stand (i.e. tree population) scale. Within a forest stand, the inter-individual variability of phenological timings is expected to affect a range of tree functions among which the access to light, the use of carbon and nitrogen reserves, the absorption of minerals and the sensitivity to pathogens. Hence the individual’s phenological traits are likely to be strongly selected, resulting in an adaptation of the population to local conditions, as evidenced by latitudinal and altitudinal clines observed in common garden experiments. Studies dedicated to the within-stand variability of the timing of phenophases have to date been mostly designed for contrasting the behaviours of understory versus overstory species or seedlings compared to their adult conspecifics. The few published papers studying the phenological timings among adult conspecifics revealed unclear patterns. We aimed at clarifying the understanding of the within-stand variability of tree phenology of three of the main European deciduous species (Quercus petraea, Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica) through the analysis of a unique phenological database collected over 44 (28 Oak sites, 16 Beech stands) forest stands at the tree level for 4 years over France.\nWe show that within a forest stand, individual trees have a distinct “phenological identity” resulting in a year to year conservation of (a) the individuals’ spring and autumn phenological rankings and (b) the individuals’ critical temperature sums required for budburst and senescence. The individual’s spring “phenological identity” affects its functioning and, ultimately, its competitive ability: big trees burst earlier. Acknowledging that Angiosperms show low genetic diversity between populations, we show that the between-site variability of critical temperature sums needed for budburst or senescence is low. We show that this between-site variability is linked to climate and geographical gradients, which suggest local adaptations of the populations’ phenological traits.",

            "abstract": "At fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges the axial melt lenses sandwiched between the lower oceanic crust and the sheeted dike sequences are assumed to be the major magma source of oceanic crust accretion. According to the widely discussed “gabbro glacier” model, the formation of the lower oceanic crust requires efficient cooling of the axial melt lens, resulting in partly crystallization and leading to crystal-melt mush which may subside down to form the lower crust. These processes are believed to be controlled dominantly by periodical magma supply and hydrothermal circulation above melt lens. Here we quantify the cooling rate above melt lens using chemical zoning of plagioclase from hornfelsic recrystallized sheeted dikes overlying the uppermost gabbros, which are part of the dike-gabbro transition zone drilled in Hole 1256D in the Eastern equatorial Pacific by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, where for the first time the dike-gabbro transition zone of an intact oceanic crust was penetrated and sampled. The measured zoning patterns are supposed to be a combined result of diffusion during both on-ridge and off-ridge cooling. We estimate the on-ridge cooling rate using a forward modelling approach based on CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion in plagioclase. The results show that the recrystallized sheeted dikes have been cooled from the peak thermal overprint at 1000-1050 °C to 600 °C within about 5-30 years as a result of hydrothermal circulation above a melt lens during a period of magma starvation, corresponding to a cooling rate of 30±15 °C/yr. Heat balance calculation also approves that in order to balance the heat output of a melt lens at a fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge similar to the case of IODP Hole 1256D, the cooling rate above the melt lens is required to be around 30 °C/yr. The estimated rapid hydrothermal cooling rate coincides with the observed annual to decal episodes of melt lens fluctuation and lava eruption, which favors the “gabbro glacier” model and explains how the effective heat extraction from melt lens is achieved at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) changes during the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition were characterized by substantial cooling at high latitudes and less cooling in low latitudes, with little information from mid-latitudes so far. Taking advantage of the newly retrieved drift sediments from the IODP 342 Expedition, we aim to reconstruct SST changes at the mid-latitude Newfoundland region, at an unprecedented orbital resolution from Site U1411. During the period investigated, 32-36 Ma, the alkenone UK’37 values range from 0.65 to 0.95, with values all greater than 0.80 before the transition and lower values (<0.80) occurring approximately at the eccentricity minimum nodes after the transition. No immediate cooling associated with Oi-1 glaciation was observed. During the Oligocene, SSTs during warm epochs (corresponding to eccentricity maxima) were not significantly cooler than before. Overall, SST fluctuations appear to be modulated by orbital changes throughout the record, although more apparent due to larger amplitude of SST variability after the transition. We thus hypothesize that the mid-latitude Newfoundland region was largely bathed by low-latitude warm waters during the transition and that polar waters (fronts) reached to the region occasionally at periods of eccentricity minimum nodes during the Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "Autumn-sown crops act as winter cover crop, reducing soil erosion and nutrient leaching, while potentially providing higher yields than spring varieties in many environments. Nevertheless, overwintering crops are exposed for longer periods to the vagaries of weather conditions. Adverse winter conditions, in particular, may negatively affect the final yield, by reducing crop survival or its vigor. The net effect of the projected shifts in climate is unclear. On the one hand, warmer temperatures may reduce the frequency of low temperatures, thereby reducing damage risk. On the other hand, warmer temperatures, by reducing plant acclimation level and the amount and duration of snow cover, may increase the likelihood of damage. Thus, warmer climates may paradoxically result in more extensive low temperature damage and reduced viability for overwintering plants. The net effect of a shift in climate is explored by means of a parsimonious probabilistic model, based on a coupled description of air temperature, snow cover, and crop tolerable temperature. Exploiting an extensive dataset of winter wheat responses to low temperature exposure, the risk of winter damage occurrence is quantified under conditions typical of northern temperate latitudes. The full spectrum of variations expected with climate change is explored, quantifying the joint effects of alterations in temperature averages and their variability as well as shifts in precipitation. The key features affecting winter wheat vulnerability to low temperature damage under future climates are singled out.",

            "abstract": "Although different strategies have demonstrated that incorporation of expert and a priori knowledge can help to improve the realism of models, no systematic strategy has been presented in the literature for constraining the model parameters to be consistent with the (sometimes) patchy understanding of a modeler regarding how the real system might work. Part of the difficulty in doing this is that expert knowledge may not always consist of explicitly quantifiable relationships between physical system characteristics and model parameters; rather, it may consist of conceptual understanding about consistency relationships that must exist between various model parameter or behavioral relationships that must exist among model state variables and/or fluxes.\nApart from aforementioned constraints, a unified strategy for measurement of information content in hierarchal model building seems lacking. Firstly the model structure is built by its building blocks (control volumes or state variables) as well as interconnecting fluxes (formation of control volumes and fluxes). Secondly, parameterizations of model are designed, as an example the effect of a specific type of stage-discharge relation for a control volume can be explored. At the final stage the parameter values are quantified. In each step and based on assumptions made, more and more information is added to the model.\nIn this study we try to construct (based on hierarchal model building scheme) and constrain parameters of different conceptual models built on landscape units classified according to their hydrological functions and based on our logical considerations and general lessons from previous studies across the globe for a Luxembourgish catchment.\nBased on the result, including our basic understanding of how a system may work into hydrological models appears to be a powerful tool to achieve higher model realism as it leads to models with higher performance. Progressive measurement of performance and uncertainty indicates which of the structural elements, parameterization or constraints contributes significantly in capturing the system behavior. Moreover, this attempt can be seen as a platform which brings the opportunity for both modelers and experimentalists to better communicate and test their hypothesis and assumptions.",

            "abstract": "Current satellite observations of tropospheric composition made from low Earth orbit provide at best one or two measurements each day at any given location. Coverage is global but sparse, often with large uncertainties in individual measurements that limit examination of local and regional atmospheric composition over short time periods. This has hindered the operational uptake of these data for monitoring air quality and population exposure, and for initializing and evaluating chemical weather forecasts. By the end of the current decade there are planned geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite missions for atmospheric composition over North America, East Asia and Europe with additional missions proposed. Together, these present the possibility of a constellation of GEO platforms to achieve continuous time-resolved high-density observations of continental domains for mapping pollutant sources and variability on diurnal and local scales. We describe Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate the contributions of these GEO missions to improve knowledge of near-surface air pollution due to intercontinental long-range transport and quantify chemical precursor emissions. We discuss the requirements on measurement simulation, chemical transport modeling, and data assimilation for a successful OSSE infrastructure. Our approach uses an efficient computational method to sample a high-resolution global GEOS-5 chemistry Nature Run over each geographical region of the GEO constellation. The demonstration carbon monoxide (CO) observation simulator, which is being expanded to other chemical pollutants, currently produces multispectral retrievals and captures realistic scene-dependent variation in measurement vertical sensitivity and cloud cover. We use the DART Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter to assimilate the simulated observations in a CAM-Chem global chemistry-climate model Control Run. The impact of observing over each region is evaluated using data denial experiments. Finally, we report on international collaborations using the OSSE approach to determine expected performance of planned satellite systems and set requirements for future missions.",

            "abstract": "The Chihshang terrace group is located on the hanging wall of the Chihshang Fault, one of the most active segments of the Longitudinal Valley Fault which represents the onland plate-suture fault between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates in eastern Taiwan. Being different from common river terraces usually developed on two sides of river channel, the Chihshang terrace group is located on the toe area of the large alluvial fan of east-flowing Xinwulyu River, which derived from the Central Range and crosses the 5-7-km-wide Longitudinal Valley to reach the Coastal Rang and has been cut through by the west-thrusting Chihshang Fault.\nThe 5-m DEM morphology analyses results show the Chihshang terrace group can be divided into ten levels of various height differences. The spatial distribution of terraces is uneven: higher levels (T5 to T10, >34 m high) and lower levels (T1 and T2, <23 m high) distribute on the northern part of alluvial fan, medium levels (T3 and T4, around 25-32 m high) on the middle part, and no terraces can be found on the southern part. Field investigations and the observations from six trenches on terraces surface show that the compositing units of terraces from top to bottom are: the Coastal Range colluviums deposits from local hills or tributaries, the Central Range deposits from Xinwulyu River channel deposits, and the bedrock. Based on these results it appears that the Chihshang terrace group was formed under influence of the continuous thrusting movement of the Chihshang Fault and the episodic lateral erosion and sedimentation of Xinwulyu River on to the hanging wall area. The uneven geographic distribution of terraces reveals the channel migration history of the Xinwulyu River.\n14C dating result of the Coastal Range deposits in a high level terrace (T7, around 30 m high from the footwall) is 5,750-6,880 cal yr B.P. Combine with previous reported data (290-490 cal yr B.P. of lowest level terrace) it reveals that the Xinwulyu River flowed to the north at least seven thousand years ago, and changed its flowing direction to the south in few hundred years ago. Together with the sedimentation rate of the footwall (1.0-1.2 cm/yr) the estimated maximum long-term vertical rate of faulting for the past seven thousand years is 1.4-1.7 cm/yr, which is a factor of two lower than the present geodetic data (2.5-3.0 cm/yr).",

Recent observed assessments have highlighted coherent long-term temperature and salinity changes that appear consistent with CMIP multi-model mean assessments, however there are discrepancies in the absolute magnitude of these observed and simulated changes. In this study, we use global climate models (from the CMIP5 and CMIP3 model suites) and a number of available observational analyses to investigate the global and regional distribution of temperature and salinity changes in neutral density space. Unlike the classical fixed-depth diagnostics, isopycnal analysis provides a lagrangian view of ocean property changes that can be directly related to surface fluxes and upper ocean water mass transformation, while essentially ignoring isopycnal heave. The comparison of pre-industrial and historical (1860-2005) simulations allows us to precisely describe where the heat and salt is stored as a result of modified forcing, leveraging off a large suite of similarly forced simulations. We also evaluate the modeled global and regional isopycnal climatologies against recent (ARGO) observations with better spatio-temporal coverage, to investigate model performance.",

            "abstract": "The Al Hoceima region of Northern Morocco is located within the east-west trending imbricated thrust-and-fold system of the Rif Mountain range that results from collision between the African and Eurasian plates. The transpressive tectonics and existence of a complex fault with thrust, normal and strike-slip faulting in the Rif probably reflect the rapidly changing local tectonic regime with block rotations during the Neogene and Quaternary (Meghraoui et al., 1996). The Al Hoceima earthquakes of the May 26, 1994 (Mw=6.0) and February 24, 2004 (Mw=6.4) are the largest seismic events in the last century that occurred on conjugate strike-slip faults trending approximately NNE-SSW and NW-SE on the Rif Mountain range (Akoglu et al., 2006). Models of the 2004 earthquake based on InSAR data suggest different fault ruptures with mainly NW-SE trending planar or curved shaped right-lateral strike-slip fault (Cakir et al., 2006; Biggs et al., 2006; Tahayt et al., 2009), consistent with the aftershocks distribution on surface and in deep (Van der Woerd et al., 2014). In this study, the postseismic deformation is studied using the Synthetic Aperture Radar Small Baseline (SBAS) technique. InSAR time series calculated from 15 Envisat ASAR images using Stanford Method of Persistent Scatterers (Hooper, 2008) reveal the subtle ground movements on the Al Hoceima region between 2004 and 2010 where a remarkable coseismic displacement was observed after the earthquake. SBAS analysis shows up to 4 cm cumulative line-of-sight movement towards and away from the satellite in the region of coseismic surface deformation, which is in good agreement with right-lateral strike-slip motion. The spatial pattern of the postseismic deformation field however requires not only afterslip on the coseismic fault but also aseismic slip on a fault that splays from the coseismic rupture to northeast. Reactivation of the fault splay is most likely caused by postseismic afterslip on the coseismic fault plane itself. On the basis of these new observations we revised the coseismic model using the same data set (one ascending and one descending interferogram) used by Cakir et al., (2006). The results suggest that the earthquake rupture took place on a fault with listric geometry and a synthetic fault on the hangingwall was reactivated during the postseismic period.",

However, Northern Apennines, Alps and surrounding regions are often studied separately, and a joint interpretation of the Alps-Apennines transition zone is still lacking. In this perspective, the China-Italy-France Alps seismic survey (CIFALPS) provided an improved image of the crust and upper mantle beneath the southwestern Alps and the Alps-Apennines transition zone. Here, we present the SKS shear wave splitting results obtained from the analysis of teleseismic data recorded by 55 temporary seismic stations along the CIFALPS profile. The strain-induced lattice preferred orientation of olivine minerals within the upper mantle, expressed by the analysis, confirms the NW trending fast polarization directions parallel to the strike of the orogen, in good agreement with the results of previous studies all along the Alpine chain. Instead, a scattering in the distribution of new shear wave splitting measurements is evidenced in the Po Plain, where the coexistence of both NNE-SSW and E-W directions provides new insights on upper mantle deformation in the complex transition zone between the Alps and the Apennines.",

            "abstract": "The governing factors of stable isotopic compositions of precipitation in the tropics are highly uncertain and controversial, but the knowledge of such factors is very useful for our understanding of the regional climate. We analyzed d18O and d2H of daily precipitation samples collected from several meteorological stations in Singapore between November 2013 and the present, and examined their possible control factors. The d18O value varies from 1.41 to -17.52‰, and the d2H value from 11.92 to -126.70‰. The samples with the lowest d-values were collected during two different periods: the beginning of the 2013/2014 Asian winter monsoon and the end of the intra-monsoon season (May 2014).\nAir mass trajectories and atmospheric re-analysis data reveal that some subtropical intro-seasonal systems are likely the major causes of the lowest d-values observed in precipitation; these systems brought moisture with very low d-values to the study area in December 2013 from the North Hemisphere subtropics, and in May 2014 from the South Hemisphere subtropics. During the period without significant intrusion of subtropical weather systems, local moisture from the Indian Ocean and the West Pacific Ocean is the major source for the precipitation in the area, and thus the corresponding d-values of the precipitation tend to be relatively high.\nThere is no significant correlation existing between d-values of daily precipitation and rain amounts. A weak negative correction, however, is observed between the d-values of daily precipitation and in-situ relative humidity. This suggests some significant evaporative enrichment in raindrops during the condensation in the dry seasons, e.g., between February and March 2014, during which the precipitation samples collected generally have the highest d-values. Further data analysis and studies are needed to investigate the influences of other climate processes on the stable isotopic compositions of daily precipitation in Singapore.",

            "abstract": "With its thick, Oligocene to recent sedimentary filling, the Adana Basin of southern Turkey, located between the SE margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP) and the SW branch of the East Anatolian Fault, is ideally located to record topographic and tectonic changes in Neogene times. We correlate 34 seismic profiles with corresponding exposed units in the Adana Basin, the age constraints of which have been recently improved through detailed biostratigraphic correlation with the broader Mediterranean stratigraphy. The time-depth conversion of the interpreted profiles allows us to reconstruct the subsidence curve of the Adana Basin, which reveals a major increase in subsidence rate in late Messinian times (5.45 to 5.33 Ma), associated with the deposition of ~1500 km3 of conglomerates and marls. Our provenance and paleocurrent analyses of the exposed conglomerates reveal that most of the sediment is derived from the SE margin of the CAP and the plateau region farther north. A comparison of these results with the composition of recent fluvial conglomerates and the present drainage basins indicates major changes between late Messinian and present-day source areas. We suggest that these changes result from the uplift and ensuing erosion of the SE margin of the plateau. This hypothesis is corroborated by a comparison of the Adana Basin’s subsidence curve with that of the Mut Basin, a mainly Neogene basin located atop the CAP’s southern margin. The Adana Basin’s rapid subsidence event is approximately coeval with an uplift episode at the plateau’s southern margin (after ca. 7 Ma), and its timing provides the first minimum time constraint on the timing of plateau margin uplift. Preliminary results from a structural analysis show that extensional and transtensional structures likely helped accommodate the differential uplift of the source (CAP SE margin) relative to the sink (Adana Basin).",

            "abstract": "In semi-arid regions, irrigation is often needed for cultivation and greatly impacts the water cycle of agricultural catchments. It is important to investigate the effects of climate change in these settings under consideration of future agricultural management and irrigation needs. However, quantifying how irrigation influences climate-change effects is still a challenge. Understanding the differences in climate-change sensitivity between irrigated and non-irrigated catchments would allow refining regional-scale assessments of climate-change impacts.\nWe investigated a catchment in north-east Spain which had not been irrigated prior to 2006 and where 54% of the land is now converted to irrigated agriculture. Data on hydraulic heads, discharge, and irrigation were used to simulate coupled surface-subsurface flow in the catchment, using the pde-based model HydroGeoSphere. The model performs well for both irrigated and non-irrigated periods. To predict future climate scenarios in the region, we use four regional climate models from the ENSEMBLE project (P.van der Linden and J.Mitchell, ENSEMBLES: Climate Change and its Impacts [...], Met Office Hadley Center, 2009) and three downscaling methods. We further investigated four irrigation scenarios, based on projected potential evapotranspiration.\nPreliminary results show a shift in the hydrological regime of the catchment under future climate scenarios. Under irrigation, the variability of low-flow discharge increases in future climate. On the contrary, peak flows increase and hydraulics heads decrease significantly in the non-irrigated scenarios. For example, annual maximum flow increases by about 15 % in the non-irrigated case but there is only little change in the corresponding irrigated scenarios. Sensitivity to projected precipitation changes is higher without irrigation, while potential evapotranspiration has more importance for irrigated catchments.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a strong greenhouse gas and a major sink for stratospheric ozone. In biological wastewater treatment N2O can be produced via several pathways. This study investigates the dynamics of N2O emissions from a nitritation-anammox reactor, and links its interpretation to the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic signature of the emitted N2O. A 400-litre single-stage nitritation-anammox reactor was operated and continuously fed with digester liquid. The isotopic composition of N2O emissions was monitored online with quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS; Aerodyne Research, Inc.; Waechter et al., 2008). Dissolved ammonium and nitrate were monitored online (ISEmax, Endress + Hauser), while nitrite was measured with test strips (Nitrite-test 0-24mgN/l, Merck).\nTable 1.

A less likely explanation is that the SP of N2O was increased by partial N2O reduction by heterotrophic denitrification. Various experiments were conducted to further investigate N2O formation pathways in the reactor. Our data reveal that N2O emissions increased when reactor operation was not ideal, for example when dissolved oxygen was too high (Table 1). SP measurements confirmed that these N2O peaks were due to enhanced nitrifier denitrification, generally related to nitrite build-up in the reactor (Figure 1; Table 1). Overall, process control via online N2O monitoring was confirmed to be an ideal method to detect imbalances in reactor operation and regulate aeration, to ensure optimal reactor conditions and minimise N2O emissions.\n",

            "abstract": "Nyamulagira is the westernmost volcano of the Virunga volcanic province, in the western branch of the East African Rift. This shield volcano is one of the most active African volcanoes with one eruption every 1-4 year(s). Nyamulagira’s eruptions usually occur along the flanks of the main edifice and in the lava plain, producing pyroclastic cone(s) and 10-20 km-long lava flows. Between 1913 and 1938, the activity was however restricted to the summit caldera, where lava fountains progressively gave birth to a lava lake, which disappeared in 1938 during the partial collapse of the summit caldera and the onset of a 2.5 years-long flank eruption. The location of flank eruptions and the orientation of the eruptive fissures are strongly influenced by the edifice loading, and by the NNW-SSE fracture network that crosses the main edifice and link it to the neighboring Nyiragongo volcano. But rift fault can also influence fissure orientations and cone alignments, especially for distal events. The flank eruptions typically have similar characteristics, lasting few days to few weeks, with an average of 20-30 days. Less frequently, flank eruptions can be larger and more complex, lasting several months and/or emitting much larger volumes of lava. By combining historical and recent observations, we suggest that magma overpressure at shallow depth is the main cause of flank events. Major eruptions seem to be related to a deeper source able to trigger large magma injections through deep structures, such as rift faults. Since April 2012, the activity of Nyamulagira is restricted to the summit caldera, with continuous and intense gas emissions and, since mid-2014, by lava fountains. This change in eruptive behavior, if it persists, may leads to the emergence of a new lava lake and may significantly decreases the frequency of flank events",

            "abstract": "Bayesian model averaging (BMA) ranks and averages a set of plausible, competing models, based on their fit to available data and based on their model complexity. BMA requires determining Bayesian model evidence (BME), which is the likelihood of the observed data integrated over each model parameter space. The BME integral is highly challenging, because it is as high-dimensional as the number of model parameters. Three classes of techniques are available to evaluate BME, each with its own challenges and limitations:\nExact analytical solutions are fast, but restricted by strong assumptions.\nBrute-force numerical evaluation is accurate, but quickly becomes computationally unfeasible.\nApproximations known as information criteria (AIC, BIC, KIC) are known to yield contradicting results in model ranking.\nWe conduct a systematic comparison of available techniques to evaluate BME, including a list of numerical schemes. We highlight their common features and differences, and investigate their computational effort and accuracy. For the latter, we investigate the impact of (a) data set size and (b) overlap between the prior and the likelihood. We use a synthetic example with an exact analytical solution (as a first-time validation against a true solution), and a real-world hydrological application, where we use a brute-force Monte-Carlo method as benchmark solution.\nOur results show that all IC differ drastically in their quality of approximation. From all IC, the KIC evaluated at the MAP performs best, but in general none of them is satisfying for non-linear model problems. Since they share the goodness-of-fit term, the observed differences imply an inaccurate penalty for model complexity. Our findings indicate that the choice of approximation method substantially influences the accuracy of the BME estimate and, consequently, the final model ranking and BMA results.",

            "abstract": "Lake Kinneret (Lake Tiberias or Sea of Galilee) is the most important freshwater reservoir in the Northern Jordan Valley. Simulations that couple fluid flow, heat and mass transport are built to understand the mechanisms responsible for the salinization of this important resource. Here the effects of permeability distribution on 2D and 3D convective patterns are compared.\n2D simulations indicate that thermal brine in Haon and some springs in the Yamourk Gorge (YG) are the result of mixed convection, i.e. the interaction between the regional flow from the bordering heights and thermally-driven flow (Magri et al., 2014). Calibration of the calculated temperature profiles suggests that the faults in Haon and the YG provides paths for ascending hot waters, whereas the fault in the Golan recirculates water between 1 and 2 km depths. At higher depths, faults induce 2D layered convection in the surrounding units.\nThe 2D assumption for a faulted basin can oversimplify the system, and the conclusions might not be fully correct. The 3D results also point to mixed convection as the main mechanism for the thermal anomalies. However, in 3D the convective structures are more complex allowing for longer flow paths and residence times. In the fault planes, hydrothermal convection develops in a finger regime enhancing inflow and outflow of heat in the system. Hot springs can form locally at the surface along the fault trace. By contrast, the layered cells extending from the faults into the surrounding sediments are preserved and are similar to those simulated in 2D. The results are consistent with the theory from Zhao et al. (2003), which predicts that 2D and 3D patterns have the same probability to develop given the permeability and temperature ranges encountered in geothermal fields. The 3D approach has to be preferred to the 2D in order to capture all patterns of convective flow, particularly in the case of planar high permeability regions such as faults.\nMagri, F., et al., 2014.

            "abstract": "The Kamojang Geothermal Field (KGF) is a typical vapor dominated hydrothermal system in West Java, Indonesia. This geothermal field is the oldest exploited geothermal field in Indonesia. From 1983 to 2005, more than 160 million tons of steam have been exploited from the KGF and more than 30 million tons of water were injected into the reservoir system. The injected water come from condensed water, local river and ground water.\nSustainable production in the geothermal energy development is the ability of the production system applied to sustain the stable production level over long times and to manage the mass balance between production, injection and natural recharge in the geothermal reservoir during exploitation. Mass balance in the reservoir system can be monitored by using time lapse gravity monitoring. Mass variation of hydrodynamic in the reservoir of KGF from 1999 to 2005 is about −3.34 Mt/year while is about −3.78 Mt/year from 1999 to 2008. Another period between 2009 and 2010, mass variation decreased about −8.24 Mt. According to the history of production and injection, natural recharge to the KGF’s reservoir is estimated at about 2.77 Mt/year from 1999 to 2005 and 2.75 Mt/year from 1999 to 2008. Between 2009 and 2010, KGF has a bigger mass deficiency rate throughout 200 MWe maintain production.\nLarge amount of fresh water is needed for sustainable geothermal energy production, while the domestic water supply need is also increased. Natural recharge, about 50% of injected water, cooling system, drilling and other production activities in KGF spend large amounts of fresh water. Water consumption for local people around KGF is about 1.46 MT/year. The water volume around KGF of total runoff is the range between dry season 0.07 MT/month and rainy season 4.4 MT/month. The water demands for sustainable geothermal production of KGF and for local people's consumption will increase in the future. Integrated planning between the energy and water sectors in KGF therefore will be essential to meet rising demands for both resources.\nKeywords: Gravity monitoring, Sustainable energy development, Water supply\nThe first author acknowledges this research activity was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25.03068.",

            "abstract": "Melting phase diagram of iron–light-element system is helpful to identify the light component in the core. If the outer core contains a single light element and the relevant binary phase diagram has a eutectic point, the core composition must lie on the iron-rich side of the eutectic. The eutectic liquid compositions in such binary systems have been examined at high pressure in a diamond-anvil cell (DAC), based on the disappearance of one of solid phases from in-situ X-ray diffraction patterns (e.g., Seagle et al., 2008 EPSL for Fe–FeO; Morard et al., 2008 EPSL for Fe–Fe3S). However, the loss of a given solid phase from the X-ray diffraction pattern does not necessarily mean its disappearance from a sample but is sometimes caused by extensive grain growth. And, it is difficult to eliminate a solid phase when axial temperature gradient is strong in a laser-heated sample. Alternatively, ex-situ textual and chemical characterization of a DAC sample could provide more solid information on the compositions of quenched liquid and coexisting solid. Here we estimated the eutectic liquid composition and the difference in silicon abundance in coexisting liquid and solid in an iron-rich portion of the Fe-FeSi binary system at high pressures to 134 GPa. Partially melted samples (Fe with 2, 4, 6.5, and 9 wt.% Si) were recovered from a DAC, and then examined with dual beam scanning microprobe (FIB + FE-SEM) (Versa 3DTM, FEI) or field-emission-type electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA) (JXA-8530F, JEOL). The X-ray map of Si demonstrated the differentiation of silicon between coexisting liquid and solid phases quantitatively. The results demonstrate that the Si content in eutectic liquid decreases rapidly with increasing pressure. If the outer core includes ~12 wt.% Si as a single light element, it crystallizes the CsCl-type (B2) phase that is more enriched in silicon than coexisting liquid. Therefore, silicon cannot be the sole light component in the core, although its presence is strongly supported by Si isotopic composition as well as Mg/Si ratio of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "On August 15, 2013, a small jökulhlaup occurred when the Gingissig ice-dammed lake was drained at Kverkfjöll, a central volcano with an active geothermal area located at the northern edge of Vatnajökull. Coincidentally after the lake level drop of about 30 m, steam-driven explosions took place at the bottom of the drained lake. The explosions involved the surficial part of a hydrothermally altered glacio-lacustrine deposit mainly composed of pyroclasts, lava fragments and volcanic bombs, interbedded with clay-rich layers. Small fans of ejecta were formed, reaching a distance of 1 km north of the lake covering an area of about 0.3 km2, with a maximum thickness of 40 cm at the crater walls.\nThe explosions were triggered by the abrupt decrease in confining pressure as a consequence to the sudden drainage of the lake which caused rapid boiling in the surficial geothermal reservoir. The thermal and craterization energy, calculated for the explosion areas, is in the order of 1013 and 1011J respectively. Comparison of the calculated energies with the ones estimated by the volume of the ejecta and the crater sizes, indicates a good agreement between models and field data.\nMorphological analyses (SEM) suggest that fragmentation due to steam expansion within the vesicles affected a low percentage of the ejected material. Impact and abrasion features are significantly more frequent suggesting relatively low energy consumption by fragmentation, in contrast to a high energy transferred to the lifting and the launching of loose particles.\nDecompression experiments were performed in the lab mimicking the conditions due to the lake drainage. Then ejection velocities of the gas–particle mixtures were measured trough image analysis of high-speed videos and used to estimate the kinetic energy release.\nThe aim of this study was to combine field and lab data with theoretical modeling to give a robust constraint on the energies released by low-magnitude steam-explosion event.",

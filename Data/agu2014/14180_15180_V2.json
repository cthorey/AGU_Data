            "abstract": "Planets like Uranus and Neptune – rich in volatiles and far from their parent stars – are common throughout the galaxy. Better understanding these ice giant planets requires a detailed knowledge of their atmospheric dynamics; these dynamics influence, for example, cloud formation and the composition of the observable atmosphere. Recent observations spanning a range of wavelengths have permitted new insights into the dynamics in the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune on both large and small scales. I will review these recent efforts and discuss exciting future prospects. Highlights include detailed, high-resolution studies of clouds and multi-wavelength efforts to trace global circulation patterns in three dimensions.",

            "abstract": "The Valley of Fire State Park, 60 km NE of Las Vegas, is a beacon of knowledge for deformation of Aztec Sandstone, a cross-bedded quartz arenite deposited in the Aztec-Navajo-Nugget erg in early Jurassic. It displays great diversity of physical properties, different localization types and micromechanics. The two deformation episodes, the Sevier folding & thrusting and the Basin & Range extension affected the area. The appearance of compaction bands marks the earliest deformation structure and their distribution, orientation, and dimension are controlled by the depositional architecture and loading. The earliest shear structures in the area are the Muddy Mountain, Summit, and Willow Tank thrusts and numerous small-scale bed-parallel faults. They altogether produced several kilometers of E-SE transport and shortening in the late Cretaceous and display numerous shear bands in its damage zone within the Aztec Sandstone. Shear bands also occur along dune boundaries and cross-bed interfaces. These observations indicate that the early deformation of the sandstone was accommodated by strain localization with various kinematics.\nThe younger generation of faults in the area is of mid-Miocene age, and crops out pervasively. It includes a series of small offset normal faults (less than a few ten meters) which can be identified at steep cliff faces. These faults are highly segmented and are surrounded by a dense population of splay fractures. A large number of these splays were later sheared sequentially resulting in a well-defined network of left- and right-lateral strike-slip faults with slip magnitudes up to a few kilometers in the Park. The formation mechanisms of both the normal and strike-slip faults can be characterized as the sliding along planes of initial weaknesses and the accompanying cataclastic deformation. Some of the initial weak planes are associated with the depositional elements such as interdune boundaries and cross-bed interfaces while others are joint zones apparently not physically connected to any observable normal fault or dune boundary fault, but consistent with the earlier extension direction. The specific kinematics of this latter period of faulting is thought to be dictated by the orientation of the depositional and structural weaknesses and the orientation and rotation of the driving stresses.",

            "abstract": "Human activities has tranformed the Earth's surface in complex ways. Here we show that not only land cover change, but also the management intensity, namely the intensification of agriculture through the Green Revolution has had a profound impact on the carbon cycle. A long-standing puzzle in the global carbon cycle is the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2. This increase likely reflects enhanced biological activity in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). It has been hypothesized that vegetation growth may have been stimulated by higher concentrations of CO2 as well as warming in recent decades, but the role of such specific mechanisms has not been quantified and they have been unable to explain the full range and magnitude of observations. Here we suggest another potential driver of the increased seasonal amplitude: the intensification of agriculture from the Green Revolution to feed a rising population, that led to a 3-fold increase in world crop production over the last 5 decades. Our analysis of CO2 data and atmospheric inversions shows a robust 15% long-term increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude from 1961 to 2010 that is punctuated by large decadal and interannual variations. The three pillars of the Green Revolution, consisting of high yield cultivars, fertilizer use, and irrigation, are represented in a terrestrial carbon cycle model. The results reveal that the long-term increase in CO2 seasonal amplitude arises from two major regions in the NH: the mid-latitude cropland between 25N-60N that encompasses the world’s major agriculture zones in Asia, Europe and North America, and the high-latitude natural vegetation between 50N-70N that includes much of the Northern boreal forests, tundra and some deciduous forests. The long-term trend of seasonal amplitude is 0.3% per year, of which sensitivity experiments attribute 43% to land use change, 31% to climate variability and change, and 26% to CO2 fertilization. Our results suggest that human land use and management is a key driver in the changing seasonal ‘breathing’ of the biosphere as well as the long-term carbon sink. Research priorities thus need to balance the studies of both the natural systems and human system, and importantly the interplay between them.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 318 drilled Site U1361 on the continental rise offshore of the Wilkes sub-glacial basin. The goal was to reconstruct the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) during Neogene warm periods. Teasing out the paleoenvironmental implications is essential for understanding the evolution of the EAIS. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is sensitive to differential compaction and other rock magnetic parameters like isothermal remanence and anhysteretic remanence are very sensitive to changes in the terrestrial source region. In general, highly anisotropic layers correspond with laminated clay-rich units, while more isotropic layers are bioturbated and have less clay. Layers enriched in diatoms are associated with the latter, which also have higher Ba/Al ratios indicating higher productivity. Higher anisotropy layers have lower porosity and moisture contents and have fine grained magnetic mineralogy dominated by magnetic. Higher anisotropy layers are dominated by maghemite, supporting the suggestion by Cook et al. (2013) of different source regions during low and high productivity times. They tied the two facies to the coastal outcrops of the Lower Paleozoic granitic terranes and the Ferrar Large Igneous Province in the more inland Wilkes Subglacial Basin respectively. Here we present evidence for a third geological unit, one eroded at the boundaries between the high and low clay zones with a “hard” (hematite) dominated magnetic mineralogy. This unit likely outcrops in the Wilkes sub-glacial basin and could be hydrothermally altered Beacon sandstone similar to that detected by Craw and Findlay (1984) in Taylor Valley or the equivalent to the Elatina Formation in the Adelaide Geosyncline in Southern Australia (Schmidt and Williams, 2013).\nCook, C.

            "abstract": "Travel-time based models are presented as an alternative to traditional spatially explicit models to solve nonlinear reactive-transport problems. The main advantage of the travel-time approach is that it does not require multi-dimensional characterization of physical and chemical parameters, and transport is one-dimensional. Spatial dimensions are replaced by groundwater travel time, defined as the time required by a water particle to reach an observation point or the outflow boundary, respectively.\nThe fundamental hypothesis is that locations of the same groundwater age exhibit the same reactive-species concentrations. This is true in strictly advective-reactive transport in steady-state flows if the coefficients of reactions are uniform and the concentration is uniform over the inflow boundary. We hypothesize that the assumption still holds when adding some dispersion in coupled flow and transport dynamics. We compare a two-dimensional, spatially explicit, bioreactive, advective-dispersive transport model, considered as “virtual truth”, with three 1-D travel-time based models which differ by the conceptualization of longitudinal dispersion: (i) neglecting dispersive mixing altogether, (ii) introducing a local-scale longitudinal dispersivity constant in time and space, and (iii) using an effective longitudinal dispersivity that increases linearly with distance.\nWe consider biodegradation of organic matter catalyzed by non-competitive inhibitive microbial populations. The simulated inflow contains oxygen, nitrate, and DOC. The domain contains growing aerobic and denitrifying bacteria, the latter being inhibited by oxygen. This system is computed in 1-D, and in 2-D heterogeneous domains.\nWe conclude that the conceptualization of nonlinear bioreactive transport in complex multi-dimensional domains by quasi 1-D travel-time models is valid for steady-state flow if the reactants are introduced over a wide cross-section, flow is at quasi-steady state, and dispersive mixing is adequately parameterization. First results considering diurnal fluctuations of flow rate of the uniform velocity field point out to match of concentrations with respect to average travel-time the estimated “virtual truth”.",

            "abstract": "Redox state of magma is important to understand dynamics of volcanic eruptions because magma properties such as composition of degassed volatiles, stability field of minerals, and rheology of magma depend on redox state. To evaluate redox state of magma, Fe3+/ΣFe ratio [= Fe3+/( Fe3++ Fe2+)] of volcanic glass has been measured non-destructively by Fe-K edge μ-XANES (micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) spectroscopy (e.g., Cottrell and Kelly, 2011).\nWe performed textural, compositional, and Fe-K edge μ-XANES analyses on volcanic ash to infer oxidation process of magma at shallow conduit during eruption at Bromo Volcano, Indonesia. The volcanic ash particles were collected in 24th March 2011 by real-time sampling from ongoing activity. The activity was characterized by strombolian eruption showing magma head ascended to near the ground surface. The ash sample contains two type of volcanic glasses named as Brown and Black glasses (BrG and BlG), based on their color. Textual analysis shows microlite crystallinities are same in the two type of glasses, ranging from 0 to 3 vol.%. EPMA analyses show that all of the glasses have almost identical andesitic composition with SiO2 = 60 wt.%. In contrast, Fe-K edge μ-XANES spectra with the analytical method by Ishibashi et al. (in prep) demonstrate that BrG (Fe3+/ΣFe = 0.20-0.26) is more oxidized than BlG (Fe3+/ΣFe = 0.32-0.60). From combination of the glass composition, the measured Fe3+/ΣFe ratio and 1060 degree C of temperature (Kress and Carmichael, 1991), the oxygen fugacities are estimated to be NNO and NNO+4 for BrG and BlG, respectively. The volcanic glasses preserve syn-eruptive physicochemical conditions by rapid quenching due to their small size ranging from 125 to 250 μm. Our results demonstrate that BrG and BlG magmas are textually and chemically identical but their redox conditions are different at the eruption. The oxidation of magma can be caused by following two processes; 1) diffusive transport of oxygen, and 2) dissociation reaction of hydrogen from magma head. The two processes should be easy to occur in shallower region of the conduit. Therefore we suggest BlG magma existed in shallower part of the conduit than BrG magma. The K-edge μ-XANES analysis can be strong tool for understanding on degassing and ascent process of magma at shallow conduit.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon dating of carbon (C) encapsulated in phytoliths (phytC) is currently used in many Earth Science disciplines for absolute chronologies and paleoclimatic reconstructions; however, the usefulness of phytC has been hampered by inadequate extraction methods[1] and uncertainties regarding its origin as purely photosynthetic [2,3,4]. An early investigation measuring isotopes from Gramineae spp. grown in free-air C enrichment experiments (FACE), showed that part of of its phytC is from a non-photosynthetic source, thus indicating a dual origin[5]. To demonstrate that non-photosynthetic sources within phytC could be from soil C stocks, we measured 14C-AMS phytC extracted from a set of Sorghum bicolor growing on known 14C and d13C bulk substrates and hydroponic solutions. The phytolith concentrates and a silica blank were extracted at UCI, CEREGE and Wisconsin using an improved protocol [1,2]. We also measured CO2 fluxes and isotopic signatures of microbial respiration, percentage of biomass and phytolith extracts produced, and isotopic signatures of the local air and bulk-plant during the growing season of 2012. This allowed comparison of the belowground substrate and nutrient C contributions to phytC 14C results. Meanwhile, NanoSIMS analyses of phytolith polished sections was used to locate phytC in the phytolith siliceous structure [6]. These results will be shown and discussed.\n[1] Corbineau et al. 2013 R.

            "abstract": "Volcanic jets can undergo gravitational collapse to produce pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), or loft material several tens of kilometres and spread out as an ash cloud. The key ingredient that determines which of these two phenomena will occur is the turbulent entrainment of atmospheric air, which adds buoyancy to the jet. Classical models of eruption columns assume that the rate of entrainment is fixed and ~10% of the upflow rate of the jet. In particular, the efficiency of entrainment is assumed to be independent of the vent shape as well as the physical properties of the pyroclastic mixture. However, we show that the presence of particles of certain particle-size distributions (PSDs) in the jet can have a significant effect on the entrainment rate owing to their buoyancy and inertia. As a consequence, the conditions for collapse as previously identified must be revisited. In particular, there is a possibility for an eruption to produce both a buoyant column and a collapsing fountain. Using scaled analogue experiments, we test the likelyhood of collapse and the production of pyroclastic flows according to the source geometry and particle-size distributions.",

            "abstract": "We report the findings of the NSF-supported Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) investigation of the Oso Landslide. Our findings are principally based on data collected during a four-day team reconnaissance across the entire landslide area, but also draw upon other data sources including lidar surveys, high-resolution imagery, geologic mapping, precipitation data, and seismic records. The Oso Landslide claimed 43 lives, making it the deadliest landslide disaster in U.S. history. The landslide occurred within a thick sequence of glacial sediments that were deposited into the North Fork Stillaguamish River valley during the last glacial advance. Geomorphic evidence suggests that the valley in the vicinity of Oso Landslide has experienced multiple large landslides over at least the past 6,000 years.\nIntense three-week rainfall that immediately preceded the event very probably played an important role in triggering the landslide; however, many other factors likely contributed to destabilization of the landslide mass. These include: (i) alteration of the local groundwater recharge and hydrogeological regime due to previous landsliding and, possibly, land use practices, (ii) weakening and alteration of the landslide mass due to previous landsliding and other natural geologic processes, and (iii) changes in stress distribution resulting from removal and deposition of material from earlier landsliding. During our field reconnaissance we identified six distinctive landslide zones and several subzones that are characterized by different geomorphic expression resulting from deformation styles, geologic materials, vegetation, and sequence of deposition. Based on the reconnaissance observations and other available data, we hypothesize that the landslide occurred in two major stages. The first stage of movement is interpreted to be a remobilization of the 2006 slide mass and headward extension that included part or all of the forested slope of an ancient landslide. The second stage occurred in response to the unloading and the redirection of stresses within the landslide mass.\nWe additionally approximated the risk for fatalities due to landslides in the region and found that it to be relatively high compared to guidelines for landslides in other developed countries and for large dams in the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Unaltered mountainous streams provide insight into natural processes and mechanisms of organic carbon (OC) retention in riparian ecosystems. Our prior work indicates that downed large wood and soil OC are the primary reservoirs for OC storage in mountainous headwaters streams of the Colorado Front Range. We surveyed downed large wood and floodplain soil along 24 study reaches in mountainous headwater streams in and around Rocky Mountain National Park, CO. Comparison of study reaches with various degrees of valley confinement in old growth (>200 yrs) and younger subalpine and montane forests reveals geologic and biogeomorphic controls for OC retention. Preliminary results indicate that unconfined valley segments store much more OC per area (783 Mg/ha) compared to partly confined and confined valley segments (153 Mg/ha). Unconfined valley segments store a significant amount of OC along single thread channels and facilitate potential for development of multithread channels. Multithread channels in old-growth forests, with trees large enough to create persistent channel-spanning logjams, store relatively little sediment and a disproportionately large amount of OC as large wood. Beaver dams also facilitate the development of multithread channels and high soil OC content in beaver meadows constitutes the largest OC pools among all channel types. Preliminary reach-average radiocarbon ages from charcoal in floodplain sediment of three study reaches with drainage areas <20 km2 (1438 ± 84 yBP), 20 – 100 km2 (539 ± 110 yBP), and >100 km2 (887 ± 84 yBP) indicate that floodplain sediment turnover time is much longer in small streams at higher, subalpine elevations. Snowmelt-dominated hydrographs in these high-elevation streams rarely exhibit bimodal characteristics typical of the hydrologic disturbance regime in lower elevation montane forests of the region, which are influenced by large convective thunderstorms and monsoons of the southwestern US. The downstream cumulative effect in larger basins at lower elevation appears to be faster turnover times for floodplain sediment and associated soil OC.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization is a common mineralogical process that occurs in ultramafic rocks when water interacts with the primary minerals olivine and pyroxene to form a rock dominated by serpentine. Temperature of hydration and the primary mineralogy of the peridotite strongly influence the alteration products. We studied peridotites with low to extremely low degrees of serpentinization from two settings, the Santa Elena ophiolite in Costa Rica and the Gakkel Ridge, to test how temperature and primary mineralogy control reactions, reaction sequences, and subsequent vein textures during peridotite hydration. Serpentinization of a harzburgite from Costa Rica occurred at around 250°C, resulting in olivine-hosted veins that are a mixture of brucite and serpentine – with a bulk composition approximately equivalent to hydrated host olivine – and later stage veins that also contain magnetite. Serpentinite that formed by hydration of orthopyroxene is accompanied by talc, with a bulk composition (serp + tlc) that is depleted in silica relative to the orthopyroxene host. In contrast, veins in orthopyroxene in an almost un-serpentinized peridotite (degree of serpentinization ~ 5 %) from the ultra-slow spreading Gakkel Ridge have an average composition very similar to the host orthopyroxene, whilst veins in olivine suggest slight enrichment in silica compared to the host olivine. Replacement of orthopyroxene here results in the formation of serpentine, talc and amphibole. The presence of amphibole in orthopyroxene and the higher degree of orthopyroxene replacement compared to olivine suggests that serpentinization occurred at higher temperatures than in the Santa Elena peridotites, resulting in the mobilization of more silica through the system.\nThermodynamic models of the hydration of olivine and orthopyroxene agree with the mineralogical observations and show that hydration of olivine first results in the simple formation of serpentine and brucite. Increasing water-rock ratios then increase fluid availability, permitting magnetite formation in olivine-hosted veins. At increased silica activity brucite becomes instable so that hydration of orthopyroxene results in the formation of serpentine and talc, with locally forming amphibole.",

            "abstract": "Organic-soil horizons exert significant control on soil temperature and permafrost dynamics in high-latitude regions. Ecosystem protection of permafrost is governed by the low thermal conductivity of organic soils, which is sensitive to changes in horizon thickness (OHT), moisture content, and decomposition extent (and thus, porosity, and density) of organic matter. At broad spatial scales, the occurrence of permafrost is positively correlated with OHT when organic horizons are relatively thin (< 30 cm). Across sites where OHT is deeper, this correlation reverses and becomes negative. We hypothesize that this bi-modal relationship between OHT and permafrost occurrence is primarily governed by the contrasting thermal properties of upper organic-soil horizons and the underlying deep organic-soil and mineral-soil horizons. As documented with prior investigations on snow thermal properties, we find that that the underlying layers can have a profound impact on the insulating effect of the overlying layer. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examine the sensitivity of permafrost to soil properties (OHT, moisture content, and texture) and their variations across landscape positions and drainage class using field–based observations and generalized simulations using the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Laboratory model (GIPL). We observed significant negative correlations between minimum daily ground-surface temperature during summer and OHT across upland forest sites in interior Alaska. In peatlands, ground-surface temperature and OHT appear to be decoupled, which is likely due to variation in deposit thickness as determined by the timing of peatland formation across the region. Model results highlight the role of moisture content and water table position, both as controls on organic matter accumulation and on permafrost extent and thermal state.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of volcanic features is ultimately controlled by processes taking place beneath the surface of a planet. For this reason, characterization of volcano distribution at a global scale can be used to obtain insights concerning dynamic aspects of planetary interiors. In this work, description of the distribution of volcanic features observed on Earth and Venus is completed using density contours obtained with the Fisher kernel. Attention is focused on similar features observed in both planets. In particular two features are examined with more detail: First, a pattern of groups of clusters defining the boundaries of elliptical regions that tentatively can be associated to large mantle plumes. Second, the existence of a uniform distribution of background volcanism. The former pattern is considered to constitute the first order convective pattern of the mantle in Venus, and although it is present on Earth, it is not as prominent. In contrast, the persistent occurrence of volcanic clusters at a lower significance level, suggests the occurrence of a different scale of mantle convection that controls a more uniformly distributed volcanism. Both, the first order related to large mantle-plumes and the background volcanism are superimposed on Earth to the volcanism controlled by plate tectonics. Consequently, the global distribution of volcanism in both planets reveals that at least three types of mantle convection can take place in the terrestrial planets, and that such types of mantle convection can coexist simultaneously in one given planet, although in each case, a dominant mode is different.",

            "abstract": "This study examined the role of an online workspace component of a community in the work of a community of practice. Much has been studied revealing the importance of communities of practice to organizations, project success, and knowledge management and some of these same successes hold true for virtual communities of practice. Study participants were 75 Education and Public Outreach community members of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate Earth Forum. In this mixed methods study, online workspace metrics were used to track participation and a survey completed by 21 members was used to quantify participation. For a more detailed analysis, 15 community members (5 highly active users, 5 average users, and 5 infrequent users) selected based on survey responses, were interviewed. Finally, survey data was gathered from 7 online facilitators to understand their role in the community. Data collected from these 21 community members and 5 facilitating members suggest that highly active users (logging into the workspace daily), were more likely to have transformative experiences, co-create knowledge, feel ownership of community knowledge, have extended opportunities for community exchange, and find new forms of evaluation. Average users shared some similar characteristics with both the highly active members and infrequent users, representing a group in transition as they become more engaged and active in the online workspace. Inactive users viewed the workspace as having little value, being difficult to navigate, being mainly for gaining basic information about events and community news, and as another demand on their time. Results show the online workspace component of the Earth Science Education and Outreach Forum is playing an important and emerging role for this community by supporting knowledge building and knowledge sharing, and growing in value for those that utilizing it more frequently. The evidence suggests that with increased participation or “usage” comes increased value to the participant and the organization. This research illustrates the possible change in mindset held by participating community members when it comes to the nature of co-location. Additionally, it may be of particular importance in exploring changes in the community members’ feelings of connection and belonging.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur isotope ratio data (δ34S) have been used to provide significant insights into global biogeochemical cycling over Earth history, providing a framework for reconstructing both global redox budgets and microbial metabolic activity. However, as the record of ancient oceanic conditions becomes better resolved, reports of coeval but divergent isotopic proxies are becoming increasingly common. These sulfur isotope records are characterized not just by divergent δ34S values, but also by differences in the spatial signature and magnitude of isotopic variability. Such discordant data suggest that we do not fully understand how isotopic signatures are incorporated and eventually preserved in the rock record. Here we examine the spatial signature and magnitude of isotopic variability in modern marine systems as a function of depositional environment and differential microbial metabolic activity. Varying depositional conditions, particularly sedimentary reworking, are seen to play a major role in generating and modifying the isotopic signatures of sulfur phases in modern environments. These observations can be extrapolated to investigate records of sulfur cycling in ancient strata. The results suggest that many apparent secular δ34S trends may be related to changing depositional environment rather than changes in the global sulfur cycle. Further, this environmental dependence can also help explain coeval but discordant δ34S data from within and between sedimentary basins. Together, these observations provide new insights that enable us to reflect on and refine our interpretations of chemostratigraphic δ34S data that have the potential to constrain the behavior of the sulfur cycle over geological timescales.",

            "abstract": "Managing landscapes for conservation requires a capacity to measure habitat quality. Although multiple factors are often responsible for the distribution and abundance of herbivores, spatial variations in the quality and quantity of plant forage are known to be important for many species. While we cannot see the chemical complexity of landscapes with our naked-eye, advances in imaging spectroscopy are making it possible to assess the quality of forage on a landscape-scale. Much research in this area has focused on the ability to estimate foliar nitrogen (N), because N is believed to be a limiting nutrient for many leaf eating animals. However, the total quantity of foliar N does not necessarily reflect the amount of N that can be utilized by herbivores. Available nitrogen (AvailN) is an invitro measure of forage quality that integrates the influence of tannins and fibre on the amount of foliar N that is available for digestion by herbivores. This may be a more meaningful measure of forage quality than total N for the many herbivorous species that are sensitive to the effects of tannins. Our previous research has demonstrated that it is possible to estimate this integrated measure of foliar nutritional quality at an individual tree crown level across multiple tree species using imaging spectroscopy (HyMap). Here we present a case study of how this remote sensing data is being used to help inform landscape management and conservation decisions for an iconic Australian species, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). We review the methods involved in developing maps of integrated measures of foliar nutritional quality for browsing herbivores with airborne imaging spectroscopy data and discuss their applications for wildlife management.",

            "abstract": "Some of the main factors that contribute to changes in multiple ionospheric parameters are solar flux, geomagnetic activity, seasonal behavior, and coupling with lower atmosphere, which is particularly strong during sudden stratospheric warming events (SSW). Studying the way that these factors induce changes in the ionosphere is important, since these changes can have a negative effect on different types of communication systems. Multiple case studies have demonstrated large variations in ionospheric electron density in association with SSW in the low-latitude ionosphere, in particular near the crests of the equatorial ionization anomaly. However, the latitudinal extend of these variations was not addressed. In this study, we utilize data obtained in Puerto Rico by three instruments - Ramey digisonde, Arecibo Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) and GPS receivers to analyze four winter-time periods: two years with major SSW events (2005-2006, 2012-2013) and two years with minor SSW events (2006-2007, 2013-2014). In addition, selected cases represent two winters with low solar activity and two winters with moderate to high solar activity. The study focuses on the location of Arecibo, Puerto Rico (18.34°N, 66.75°W), ~15° to the north of the northern crest of the equatorial ionization anomaly. We report good agreement in ionospheric parameters between all three instruments. To investigate possible association with SSW events, we remove influences of seasonal behavior, solar flux, and geomagnetic activity by building empirical model and subtracting expected variations from the observational data. The analysis of residuals between the data and the model shows that ionospheric disturbances were observed in Puerto Rico for both minor and major SSW events in the ISR, digisonde and GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) data. We report 20-60% variations in NmF2 and TEC due to SSW effects. Large variations are also observed in electron density, electron temperature and plasma velocity during both daytime and nighttime.",

            "abstract": "Besides global stressors such as temperature rise and acidification, local anthropogenic disturbances, especially those connected with tourism, affect many Atlantic patch reefs off the Brazilian shore. Using reef-inhabiting foraminifera with algal symbionts as environmental indicators, we confirmed this problem in coastal reefs near Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. The foraminiferal community is particularly depauperate in the small reefs of Pirangi, about 25 km south of Natal (~6o S, water depth <5-m), showing the result of numerous tourists trampling or otherwise damaging the reef substrate. Shells of Amphistegina gibbosa, the characteristic reef foraminifer of tropical America, have an exceptionally patchy distribution here, with rare living individuals. A few other symbiont bearers, e.g. Archaias angulatus, Amphisorus hemprichii, and Heterostegina antillarum, are present, but in extremely small numbers. In general, the dominant species is Quinqueloculina lamarckiana, a eurytopic, small miliolid (without symbionts), but many specimens are brown or black, indicating a mixing of relict and living populations. Compared to known foraminiferal communities in other Brazilian reefs, species diversity at Pirangi is remarkably low. About 77 km north of Pirangi, in the more extensive patch reef system of Maracajaú, the foraminiferal community is apparently healthier, except in an area targeted for tourism. However, living Amphistegina is still rare, and the only living Amphisorus is found in seagrass habitats. In contrast, many symbiont-bearing taxa, including peneroplids (virtually absent in Pirangi and Maracajaú) exist in sizeable populations northwest of Maracajaú, in the small patch reefs of the drowned Açu river valley (~4o 50’ S).",

            "abstract": "Paratethys is a large epicontinental sea, stretching from Germany to China at the beginning of the Oligocene (~34 Myr ago), that progressively retreated by a complex combination of basin infill, glacio-eustatic sea-level lowering and tectonic uplift to its present-day remnants: Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Aral Lake. Paratethys experienced major paleoenvironmental changes towards anoxic, hypersaline, and fresh water conditions. An accurate geological time scale (GTS) is crucial to understand the timing and rates of these change and to determine the underlying mechanisms. Geological time scales for the Paratethys region are notoriously controversial and encompass mainly regional stages, which are all defined on the basis of characteristic faunal assemblages (mainly mollusks and ostracods) endemic to the Paratethys Sea.\nDuring the last decade, we have performed numerous integrated magneto-biostratigraphic studies on the Mio-Pliocene sedimentary successions of the Eastern Paratethys, which resulted in revised chronological frameworks for the Dacian, Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins. This allows high-resolution stratigraphic correlations between the individual Paratethys subbasins and with the Mediterranean successions and help to better understand the dramatic paleoenvironmental changes in the region, such as the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Rock magnetic analyses of the sedimentary sequences of the Paratethys indicate that greigite is the main magnetic carrier and that a range of magnetic properties cannot be explained by the presence of diagenetic greigite, but are instead consistent with those expected for a biogenetic (bacterial) origin.",

            "abstract": "The Na exosphere of Mercury is flux-limited, and a careful accounting of the surface reservoir is necessary in order to understand the relative importance of proposed source mechanisms for this exosphere. At the Moon, a similar analysis has not yet been performed, but recent data acquired by the Kaguya spacecraft suggest an analogous depletion of the dayside reservoir for exospheric Na. New measurements of the lunar exosphere obtained by the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) and of Mercury's exosphere by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft provide the opportunity to constrain the main parameters determining the reservoirs for these exospheres. We present a model of the exosphere-surface system that attempts to unify these two datasets. We have developed a simulator that accepts as input partially constrained microphysical parameters of the gas-surface interaction (e.g., source rates/cross sections for different source processes, degree of thermal accommodation) to make testable predictions regarding the exosphere and uppermost surface (top 10-10 m). These flux-balance simulations demonstrate that the lunar exosphere is limited by the recycling rate of Na atoms mobilized by micrometeoroid vaporization. An important consequence is that, to obtain consistency with ground-based observations of the Na exosphere, the inferred impact vapor at the Moon must peak near the equator and decrease towards the poles because of migration of surface particles toward the poles through exospheric transport. Micrometeoroid streams can have a long-term effect on the lunar exosphere because, as shown in our model, particles introduced by such streams survive in the soil and exosphere for at least two lunations. Important but secondary effects must be provided by the solar wind in order to account for the variations observed within one lunation by LADEE. In its application to Mercury, the code uses new estimates of the micrometeoroid impact vaporization rate and solar wind influx onto Mercury's high-latitude regions. We demonstrate that a model similar to that for the Moon can approximately reproduce the near-surface densities and the dawn-dusk asymmetry in the Na exosphere observed by MESSENGER during part of a Mercury year.",

            "abstract": "Global flood modelling is a relatively new framework in earth system studies, and there still exist many rooms for improving model physics. A typical grid size of global models (generally >5 km) is coarser than the scale of the topography of river channels and floodplains, therefore flood dynamics in global flood models is represented by sub-grid parameterization. Here, we introduce two latest updates in flood dynamics parameterization, i.e. channel bifurcation scheme and global river width database.\nThe upstream-downstream relationship of model grids is prescribed (i.e. parameterized) by a river network map, where each grid has been assumed to have only one downstream grid. We abandoned this “only one downstream” assumption, and succeeded to represent channel bifurcation in a global flood model. The new bifurcation scheme was tested in the Mekong River, and showed the importance of channel bifurcation in mega-delta hydrodynamics.\nChannel cross-sectional shape has been parameterized using an empirical equation of discharge (or drainage area), and it is a major source of uncertainties in global flood modelling. We recently developed a fully-automated algorithm to calculate river width from satellite water mask. By applying this algorithm to SRTM Water Body Data, the Global Width Database for Large Rivers (GWD-LR) was constructed. The difference between the satellite-based width and empirically-estimated width is very large, suggesting the difficulty of river width parameterization by an empirical equation.\nImprovement in flood dynamics parameterization reduces uncertainties in global flood simulations. This enables advanced validation/calibration of global flood models, such as direct comparison against satellite altimeters. A future strategy for advanced model validation/calibration will be mentioned in the conference presentation.",

            "abstract": "With the Aquarius mission having completed its second full year of acquiring global sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements, many corrections were accounted for and biases were removed. However, some biases remain, keeping the mission from achieving its goal of +/- 0.2 psu accuracy for monthly products (150 km pixel size). Uncertainties in the Southern Ocean (among other biases) not only keep the mission from attaining such accuracy globally, but it also forces continued reliance on in situ point data sources. A Python script package is developed to process the Level 2 data for use, allowing users to target specific variables and to prepare ship and buoy data for analysis with the Aquarius data. To test the application of the scripting package, multiple assessments are completed. (1) The relationship between Aquarius brightness temperatures (Tb) and the percentage of ice and land cover is analyzed. Exponential and linear increases in Tb are observed with increasing ice and land, respectively. Little to no effect on Tb is found when there is less than 1% ice or land cover. (2) In situ SSS, in situ sea surface temperature (SST), and Aquarius Tb within a Response Surface Model are used to generate an equation to predict SSS using only Tb and SST as inputs. SSS is found strongly relying on SST, nearly removing the need for Aquarius Tb. While this does not assist in converting Aquarius Tb into SSS, the use of SST alone proved a significantly more accurate method in predicting SSS over current Aquarius estimations for the Southern Ocean. This is not to say that SST should be used to predict SSS, but rather that the two are highly linked. Discrepancies in the relationships between SSS, SST, and Tb require further investigation before SSS can be estimated from Tb­ in the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Deformation of the Mexican Ridges fold belt (MRFB), western Gulf of Mexico, initiated in the Late Neogene in response to normal faulting along the Quetzalcoatl Extensional System offshore Veracruz. Previous authors analyzed stacking patterns of growth strata concluding deformation occurred in two stages: the western section of the fold belt developed during the Upper Miocene whereas the eastern part became active during the Lower Pliocene. Here we analyze a regional seismic line to determine whether deformation migrated progressively eastward. In contrast to previous studies we do not use stacking patterns but excess area. This parameter provides direct information of both linear shortening, and superficial mass transport. We construct excess-area plots for each of the folds comprising the MRFB; from them we estimate the shortening and the degradation path of the seafloor deformed by folding. Moreover, by assuming denudation is in steady state, we are able to differentiate sediments derived locally from sediments transported from distant sources.\nResults show tectonic transport in the MRFB is 11.8 km; shortening of individual folds ranges 3-16%, with an average strain for the entire MRFB of ~10%; structures grew at a mean uplift rate of 0.2 mm/yr. We estimate the constant of mass diffusivity, which controls the rate of degradation, has a mean value of 0.27 m2/yr. This value is characteristic of rapid, episodic mass movements. Finally, the sedimentation rate is ~0.2 mm/yr. Those parameters, however, are not constant; they decrease toward the deepwater portion of the fold belt. The structures proximal to the continental shelf are rising rapidly and are being degraded more intensely than those in the distal part of the fold belt.\nOur results reveal that deformation started synchronously throughout the MRFB during the Late Miocene and not in two episodes as previously reported. The reason for the seeming discrepancy is due to the copious sedimentation in the eastern section of the fold belt with respect to tectonic uplift. This hindered the development of onlap and thinning upward patterns that commonly signal the beginning of fold growth. The delay, in turn, introduces a bias toward younger ages in the identification of the pre-growth/growth strata limit.",

            "abstract": "Knickpoints, or convexities in a stream’s longitudinal profile, often delineate boundaries in stream networks that separate reaches eroding at different rates resulting from sharp temporal or spatial changes in uplift rate, contributing drainage area, precipitation, or bedrock lithology. We explicitly defined the geometry of a knickpoint in a manner that can be identified using an algorithm which operates in accordance with the stream power incision model, using a chi-plot analysis approach. This method allows for comparison between the real stream profile extracted from a DEM, and a linear best-fit line profile in chi-elevation space, representing a steady state theoretical stream functioning in accordance to uniform temporal and spatial conditions listed above. Assessing where the stream of interest is “under-steepened” and “over-steepened” with respect to a theoretical linear profile reveals knickpoints as certain points of slope inflection, extractable by our algorithm. \nWe tested our algorithm on a 1m resolution LiDAR DEM of Santa Cruz Island (SCI), a tectonically active island 25km south of Santa Barbara, CA with an estimated uplift rate between 0.5 and 1.2mm/yr calculated from uplifted paleoshorelines. We have identified 1025 knickpoints using our algorithm and compared the position of these knickpoints to a similarly-sized dataset of knickpoints manually selected from distance-elevation longitudinal stream profiles for the same region. Our algorithm reduced mapping time by 99.3% and agreed with knickpoint positions from the manually selected knickpoint map for 85% of the 1025 knickpoints. Discrepancies can arise from inconsistencies in manual knickpoint selection that are not present in an automated computation. Additionally, the algorithm measures useful characteristics for each knickpoint allowing for quick statistical analyses. Histograms of knickpoint elevation and chi coordinate have a 3 peaked distribution, possibly expressing 3 levels of uplifted marine terrace platforms on SCI. Few knickpoints exist with a contributing drainage area >200,000m2, demonstrating a cutoff drainage area where knickpoint migration has stalled. We intend to use this tool to further explore the significance, evolution, and dynamics of knickpoint features on SCI.",

Previous models of this system, using typical temperature profiles representative of the Venus atmosphere as a whole, did not investigate the effects of temperature variations on the UH particle distributions. Parkinson et al. (2014, submitted) showed that the inclusion of latitudinally dependent temperature profiles retrieved from SPICAV/SOIR observations in the Venus cloud model of Gao et al. (2014) resulted in markedly different cloud distributions between the different latitude cases, such as a lowered cloud base near the equator and a slightly thicker UH at the poles. Thus, temperature variations across Venus could help explain spatial variations in the atmospheric aerosol distribution. In this work, we expand on the aforementioned study by including VIRA temperature profiles derived from Venera and PVO observations (Kliore et al. 1985) at similar latitudes as the SPICAV/SOIR profiles to assess how the aerosol distribution varies spatially and temporally. By comparing the simulated cloud and haze distributions arising from the two sets of temperature profiles, we can evaluate whether secular changes have occurred in the ~30 years between the PVO and VEx epochs.",

            "abstract": "Most of Earth’s surface is created by seafloor spreading, which is one of a handful of fundamental global tectonic processes. While most seafloor spreading is orthogonal, that is, the strike of mid-ocean ridge segments are perpendicular to transform faults, examples of significant non-orthogonality have been noted since the 1970s, in particular in regions of slow seafloor spreading such as the western Gulf of Aden with the non-orthogonality up to 45°. In contrast, here we focus on fast and ultra-fast seafloor spreading along the East Pacific Rise.\nFor our analysis, instead of comparing the strike of mid-ocean ridges with the strike of nearby transform faults, the azimuth of which can be uncertain, we compare with the direction of plate motion determined from the angular velocity that best fits all the data along the boundary of a single plate pair [DeMet, Gordon, and Argus 2010]. The advantages of our approach include greater accuracy and the ability to estimate non-orthogonality where there are no nearby transform faults.\nEstimating the strikes of fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge segments present several challenges as non-transform offsets on various scales affect the estimate of the strike. Moreover, the strike may vary considerably within a single ridge segment bounded by transform faults. This is especially evident near overlapping spreading centers along with the strike varies rapidly with distance along a ridge segment. We use various bathymetric data sets to make our estimates including ETOPO1 [Amante and Eakins, 2009] and GeoMapApp [Ryan et al., 2009].\nWhile spreading is orthogonal or nearly orthogonal along much of the East Pacific Rise, it appears that some ridge segments along the Pacific-Nazca boundary near 30°S and near 16°S−22°S deviate significantly from orthogonality by as much as 6°−12° even when we exclude the portions of mid-ocean ridge segments involved in overlapping spreading centers. Thus modest but significant non-orthogonality occurs where seafloor spreading is the fastest on the planet. Implications for mid-ocean ridge processes, hypothesized lithosphere deformation, and non-closure of plate motion circuits will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of dams in New England are especially acute as it possesses one of the highest densities of dams in the US, with the NID documenting more than 4,000 dams, and state agency records indicating that >14,000 dams are peppered throughout the landscape. This large number of dams contributes to pervasive watershed fragmentation, threatening the ecological integrity of rivers and streams, and in the case of old, poorly maintained structures, posing a risk to lives and property. These concerns have generated active dam removal efforts throughout New England. To best capture the geomorphic, hydrologic, and potential ecological effects of dam removal at a regional level, we have compiled a dataset of 127 removed dams in New England, which includes information about structural characteristics, georectified locations, and key watershed attributes (including basin size, distance to next upstream obstacle, and number of free-flowing river kms opened up). Our specific research questions address (1) what is the spatial distribution of removed dams and how does this pattern relate to stated management goals of restoring critical habitat for native resident freshwater and diadromous fish, (2) what are the structural or management commonalities in dam types that have been removed, and (3) what has been the incremental addition of free-flowing river length? Rather than reflecting an overall management prioritization strategy, results indicate that dam removals are characterized more by opportunistic removals. For example, despite a regional emphasis on diadromous fish protection and restoration, most removals are inland rather than coastal settings. Most of the removed dams were small (~ 45% < 4 m) although ~10% of the removed dams were 6-8 m high. However, despite the predominant removal of small dams, these dams were not restricted to headwater locations; most (38%) occurred in medium-sized watersheds having upstream drainage areas between 100-1,000 km2 with 8% formerly impounding watersheds between 1,000 – 10,000 km2. The combined effect has been significant in opening up >2,300 river kms over the past several decades, with implication for both resident and diadromous fish, and with many removals located in mid-sized rivers that are a key link between upstream and downstream/coastal aquatic ecosystems.",

This field campaign, monitoring raw water DOM concentration and character on three contrasting rivers across the region captured the late recession curve (October 2011- September 2012).\nDOM was characterized using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra with PARAFAC analysis; δ 13C-DOC; and molecular size using liquid chromatography with organic carbon, UV254 and nitrogen detection (LC-OCD) to identify DOC fractions: biopolymers, humic substance (HS), building blocks (BB), low molecular weight acids, and low molecular weight neutrals.\nDespite the difference in catchment and climatic zones, similar trends were observed in all three rivers, where DOC concentrations gradually decreased in river streams over a year from 8-11 mgCL-1 to 3-4 mgCL-1, followed by similar changes of HS, BB and fluorescent terrestrially delivered DOM components (C1-C3). In Allyn and Patterson rivers the proportion of HS, fluorescent terrestrially delivered DOM components (C1, C2) in DOC have decreased, in contrast to Logan River, where the ratio of HS/DOC was highly variable and showed no particular trends. The proportion of other DOC components remained almost the same. Molecular weight of the HS declined from 700 gmol-1 to 610 gmol-1 in all sites. δ 13C-DOC increased during monitoring, this could be linked to general decrease of DOM proportion delivered from C4 type plants after the flood.\nOverall, although DOC concentration decreased over the year post flood at all sites, most importantly the composition of DOM changed, with major changes occurring in proportion of humic-like and fluorescent terrestrially delivered DOM. Therefore it is important to monitor DOM character to be able to assess the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on the DOM transport and transformation.",

            "abstract": "A limitation on the application of geophysical methods for the study of the upper mantle is the effect of lateral variations in the structure of the overlying crust that obscure the signal from the mantle. However, the North American upper mantle is particularly well-suited for geophysical study because crustal corrections can be made based on the results from numerous active- and passive-source seismic investigations that have determined lateral variations in crustal properties, including crustal thickness, P- and S-wave velocities, and crustal density estimated from empirical velocity-density relations. We exploit this knowledge of the crust of North America to construct an integrated 3D model of variations in density, temperature and composition within the upper mantle to a depth of 250 km. Our model is based on a joint analysis of topography, gravity, and seismic tomography data, coupled with mineral physics constraints. In the first step we remove the effect of the laterally-varying crust from the observed gravity field and topography (assuming Airy isostasy) using our crustal model NACr2014 (Tesauro et al., submitted). In the second step the residual mantle gravity field and residual topography (obtained in the first step) are inverted to obtain a 3D density model of the upper mantle. Thermal effects dominate this initial density model. To compensate for the thermal effects we invert for mantle temperatures based on the S-wave velocities determined by two seismic tomography models (S40RTS and NA2007). After removing the thermal effect from the mantle gravity anomalies we are left with the upper mantle density variations that are due to compositional variations. We recover two long-wavelength (5°-10°) features in the upper mantle compositional density model that are not evident in seismic tomography models: (1) a strong (+200 mgal) positive compositional anomaly beneath the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps due to eclogite in the uppermost mantle, and (2) a NE-SW trending positive (+140 mgal) anomaly beneath the Grenville-Appalachian suture that may indicate a remnant slab fragment in the uppermost mantle that dates to the Appalachian orogeny. These and other features in the mantle density model allow us to construct an evolutionary model for the development of the North American upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "In the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory lies Rivendell, a heavily-instrumented steep forested hillslope underlain by nearly vertically dipping argillite interbedded with sandstone. Under this convex hillslope lies “Zb”, the transition to fresh bedrock, which varies from less than 6 m below the surface near the channel to 20 m at the divide. Rempe and Dietrich (2014, PNAS) show that the Zb profile can be predicted from the assumption that weathering occurs when drainage is induced in the uplifting fresh bedrock under hillslopes by lateral head gradients driven by channel incision at the hillslope boundary. Infiltrating winter precipitation is impeded at the lower conductivity boundary at Zb, generating perched groundwater that dynamically pulses water laterally to the channel, controlling stream runoff. Below the soil and above the water table lies an unsaturated zone through which all recharge to the perched groundwater (and thus all runoff to channels) occurs. It is this zone and the waters in them that profoundly affect critical zone processes. In our seasonally dry environment, the first rains penetrate past the soil and moisten the underlying weathered bedrock (Salve et al., 2012, WRR). It takes about 200 to 400 mm of cumulative rain, however, before the underlying groundwater rises significantly. Oshun et al (in review) show that by this cumulative rainfall the average of the wide-ranging isotopic signature of rain reaches a nearly constant average annual value. Consequently, the recharging perched groundwater shows only minor temporal isotopic variation. Kim et al, (2014, GCA) find that the winter high-flow groundwater chemistry is controlled by relatively fast-reacting cation exchange processes, likely occurring in transit in the unsaturated zone. Oshun also demonstrates that the Douglas fir rely on this rock moisture as a water source, while the broadleaf trees (oaks and madrone) use mostly soil moisture. Link et al (2014 WRR) show that Doug fir declines in transpiration rate significantly compared to the madrone during summer high water stress periods, with may induce feedbacks from the forest to atmospheric temperature and humidity. Collectively these studies spotlight the seasonally dynamic unsaturated zone in the weathered bedrock beneath the soil as key to understanding critical zone processes.",

            "abstract": "Microbes mediate fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in soils depending on ratios of available C, N, and P relative to microbial demand. Hence, characterizing microbial C and nutrient limitation in soils is critical for predicting how ecosystems will respond to human alterations of climate and nutrient availability. Here, we take a stoichiometric approach to assessing microbial C, N, and P limitation by using threshold element ratios (TERs). TERs enable shifting resource limitation to be assessed by matching C, N and P ratios from microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil nutrient concentrations. We assessed microbial nutrient limitation in temperate forests dominated by trees that associate with one of two mycorrhizal symbionts: arbsucular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We found that both ECM and AM microbial communities were co-limited by C and N, supporting conventional wisdom that microbes are C-limited and temperate forests are N-limited. However, AM microbial communities were relatively more C-limited than ECM communities (P=0.001). In response to chronic field N fertilization, both AM and ECM communities became relatively more P-limited (P=0.011), but they remained N- and C-limited overall. Thus, realistic levels of N deposition may not dampen microbial N limitation. Reflecting differences in relative limitation, N mineralization rates were higher in AM soils than in ECM soils (P=0.004) while C mineralization rates were higher in ECM soils than in AM soils (P=0.023). There were no significant differences in P flux between AM and ECM soils or detectable mineralization responses to N addition, indicating that mineralization rates are closely tied to C and nutrient limitation. Overall, we found that 1) microbial resource limitation can be detected without resource addition; and 2) TERs and ratios of labile resources are viable tools for predicting mineralization responses to resource additions.",

Such record, particularly the extensional phases, can be partially destroyed and obscure by multiple deformational events, the accretion of exotic terranes and strike slip fragmentation along the margin.\nThe tectonic evolution of the northern Andes during the Mesozoic is the result of post Pangea extension followed by the installation of a long-lived Jurassic volcanic arc (209 – 136 ma) that apparently stops between 136 Ma and 110 Ma.\nThe Quebradagrande Complex has been define as a single Lower Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary unit exposed in the western flank of the Central Cordillera of the Colombian Andes that growth after the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous magmatic hiatus. The origin of this unit have been related either to an oceanic volcanic arc or a marginal basin environment. The existence of such contrasting models reflect the regional perspective followed in published studies and the paucity of detail analysis of the volcano-sedimentary sequences.\nWe integrate multiple approaches including structural mapping, stratigraphy, geochemistry, U-Pb provenance and geochronology to improve the understanding of this unit and track the earlier phases of accumulation that are mask on the overimposed tectonic history. Our preliminary results suggest the existence of different volcano-sedimentary units that accumulated between 100 Ma and 82 Ma.\nThe older Lower Cretaceous sequences was deposited over Triassic metamorphic continental crust and include a upward basin deepening record characterized by thick fan delta conglomerates, followed by distal turbidites and a syn-sedimentary volcanic record at 100 ma. The other sequence include a 85 – 82 Ma fringing arc that was also formed close to the continental margin or associated with a continental terrane.\nThis two volcano-sedimentary domains were finally juxtaposed due to the collision with an allochthonous oceanic arc that collide with the Continental margin in the Late Cretaceous marking the initiation of the Andean Orogeny.",

By performing Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on satellite observations of high cloud cover, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) — including both EP-ENSO (canonical ENSO) and CP-ENSO (ENSO Modoki) — is found to be the leading source of variability in high cloud cover. High cloud distributions are further shown to be closely associated with SST variations. The observations are compared to simulations from 20 AMIP5 models. In general, the models are able to simulate the first EOF, the EP-ENSO, in the data. However, only about half of the AMIP5 models could realistically reproduce the second EOF, the CP-ENSO. Improved understanding of high cloud variabilities will advance climate model simulations and facilitate more accurate predictions of future climate, specifically the climate response to increasing greenhouse gases such as CO2.",

In the vicinity of the Arbuckle Mts., thick mafic to intermediate lava packages interbedded with rhyolite lavas and sedimentary strata are exposed in the subsurface and penetrated by oil and gas exploration wells. We have sampled cuttings from six wells exposed along the strike of the SOA with the aim of petrographically, geochemically, and isotopically characterizing the rocks to better understand their tectonomagmatic affinity. Cuttings were observed under a binocular microscope to ensure textural homogeneity; XRF bulk chemistry from these samples show that they are relatively unaltered based on analytical totals and alteration indices. The samples plot as basalts to andesites (e.g., 47-64 wt. % SiO2) and are primarily tholeiitic. On discrimination diagrams, these samples fall in “intraplate” fields, consistent with continental basalt volcanism, including flood basalt eruptions. These lavas show Zr/Nb values ranging from 6.8 to 11.1, K/Nb values ranging from 300-600, and Ba/Nb values ranging from 10-20, which are similar to EM1 OIB. The samples also show trace element patterns consistent with OIB-like mantle sources when normalized to primitive mantle, and similar geochemical traits to the Roosevelt Gabbros that crop out along strike of the SOA in the Wichita Mts.. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope analysis is ongoing. Chemostratigraphic variations show the possibility of several lava packages. The geochemical analyses of the SOA lava flows provide insight into how these magmas formed as well as what tectonic regime (e.g., lower-mantle derived plume, upper-mantle extension, or “leaky” transform fault) produced the volcanism that affected the southern margin of Laurentia during the formation of the SOA; we favor the involvement of a deep mantle plume.",

We investigated chemical diffusion between lechatelierite (~100% SiO2) and surrounding felsic glass (~73% SiO2) in a natural indochinite tektite and in experimental analogues. We discovered concentration profiles of major elements across lechatelierite-felsic glass contacts that reflect diffusion between the two melts at high T as the they followed a ballistic trajectory prior to quenching. The profiles provide information on multicomponent diffusion at the high-silica end of composition space and on the thermal histories of tektites.\nTo reproduce the profiles, we undertook a series of high T melting experiments using an aerodynamic levitation laser furnace. A starting mixture of powdered natural tektite plus quartz grains was exposed to temperatures of 1800-2400˚C for 1-120 s. Direct comparison of concentration profiles between the indochinite and experiments reveals a best match at 2200˚C and 50 s. This experiment successfully reproduced all major aspects of the concentration profiles observed in the natural sample including diffusion length scale, asymmetry, order of steepness of major element profiles, and uphill diffusion of K2O.\nNot enough information is available to model the full multicomponent diffusion problem, but SiO2 and Al2O3 concentration profiles from lechatelierite to surrounding felsic glass in the experiments can be fit well as a diffusion couple between silica melt and adjacent felsic melt using an effective binary diffusion approach and assuming that the effective binary SiO2 and Al2O3 diffusivities depend exponentially on SiO2 concentration. Further quantification of the diffusion behavior should allow constraints on the thermal histories of tektites.",

            "abstract": "Projections of anthropogenic aerosol emissions are uncertain. In Asia, it is possible that emissions may increase if business continues as usual, with economic growth driving an increase in coal burning. But it is also possible that emissions may decrease rapidly due to the widespread adoption of cleaner technology or a shift towards non-coal fuels, such as natural gas. In this study, the transient climate impacts of three aerosol emissions scenarios are investigated: an RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) control; a scenario with reduced Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions; and a scenario with enhanced Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions. A coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration of CESM (Community Earth System Model), including CAM5 (Community Atmosphere Model version 5), is used. Enhanced Asian aerosol emissions are found to delay global mean warming by one decade at the end of the century. Aerosol-induced suppression of the East Asian and South Asian summer monsoon precipitation occurs. The enhanced Asian aerosol emissions also remotely impact precipitation in other parts of the world: over the Sahel, West African monsoon precipitation is suppressed; and over Australia, austral summer monsoon precipitation is enhanced. These remote impacts on precipitation are associated with a southward shift of the ITCZ. The aerosol-induced sea surface temperature (SST) response appears to play an important role in the precipitation changes over South Asia and Australia, but not over East Asia. These results indicate that energy production in Asia, through the consequent aerosol emissions and associated radiative effects, might significantly influence future climate both locally and globally.",

Flow regime, including frequency and magnitude of floods, and its interaction with the surrounding landscape are primary drivers of floodplain structure and ecosystem dynamics. However, these floodplain processes and functions are often altered by water management schemes, land uses, and hydroclimatic alteration induced by climate warming. Improved understanding of ecologically relevant aspects of flow regime and potential future alteration is central to managing floodplain ecosystems and their services. In order to describe the inundation regime of the lower Cosumnes River floodplain, California, this research moves beyond flood frequency analysis to examine other flood event characteristics and identify flood types using statistical cluster analysis. Floods are characterized using metrics of ecological relevance, such as magnitude, timing, duration, and total volume. To explore potential effects of climate change, non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value models are fit to historical floods based on temperature and precipitation at the monthly scale. Temperature and precipitation variables from downscaled Global Climate Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 are then applied to develop flood distributions for climate change scenarios. These results are used to adjust the magnitude of clustered flood events identified in the historical record, and the sensitivity of the inundation regime to these changes is assessed. This research provides useful scientific insights for management and restoration efforts within the Cosumnes watershed and demonstrates the utility of applying these methods to other floodplain systems.

            "abstract": "It has long been known that the microwave response is sensitive to near-surface (~5 m) liquid meltwater within ice sheets. Since the beginning of the satellite-era, active and passive microwave instruments have frequently been used to detect what have been assumed to be melt processes from space. Microwave melt models are typically threshold-based binary detections – liquid meltwater is either present or it is not. The recent discovery of substantial quantities (~140±20 Gt) of liquid meltwater stored within Greenland’s extensive firn aquifer highlights evolving knowledge of melt and retention processes within the upper layers (< ~35 m) of the percolation facies of the Greenland ice sheet, as well as limitations in current microwave melt models. Firn aquifers form as the result of high melt rates that saturate snow and firn layers with liquid meltwater during the melt season, and high snow accumulation rates that thermally insulates this saturated layer during the winter season - allowing it to be stored in liquid form at decreasing depths as refreeze propagates from the ice sheet surface downward. While subsurface liquid meltwater is known to influence the microwave response, current microwave melt models do not distinguish between the introduction of liquid meltwater controlled by melt processes and the continued presence of liquid meltwater controlled by the retention process. This research exploits the multidecadal (1992-2014) satellite-borne active (ERS, ASCAT) and passive (AMSR-E) microwave climate record to provide the first long-term, spatiotemporally continuous, observational evidence of winter season meltwater storage within Greenland’s firn aquifer. We use multi-frequency backscatter and brightness temperature image time series reconstructed at enhanced resolution (~12 km), and a microwave signature algorithm derived from a coupled two-layer radiative transfer model, to characterize both melt and retention processes using simple, time-dependent, parameters that are calibrated using thousands of airborne (IceBridge O1B accumulation radar) observations. Comparisons are made between calibrated microwave aquifer model results and aquifer simulations generated by the regional climate model RACMO2.",

            "abstract": "We compare crustal stress and strain rates on the Island of Kyushu as measured from inversions of focal mechanisms, GPS and shear wave splitting on shallow and deep earthquakes to determine how well anisotropy can be used to predict stress or strain. Shear wave splitting of local and regional earthquakes was measured on the NIED network between 2004 and 2012, and on Aso, Sakurajima, Kirishima and Unzen volcano networks. Strain measurements were made from the Geonet stations. JMA-determined S arrival times processed with the MFAST shear wave splitting code measure fast polarisations (phi), related to the orientation of the anisotropic medium and time delays (dt), related to the path length and the percent anisotropy. We apply the TESSA 2-D delay time tomography and spatial averaging code to the highest quality events with the most nearly vertical incidence angles, separating the 3455 shallow (depth < 40 km) from the 4957 deep (>=40 km) earthquakes. Using 30 km grids for all the inversions and interpolating where measurements are not available, the average difference between maximum horizontal stress axes (Shmax) and phi is nearly identical to that between maximum compressional strain rate (Mstrain) and Shmax (35 degrees). Shmax and mstrain are each also significantly correlated with Shmax, but less so with each other. Amplitudes of splitting delay time/km, strain eigenvalues and stress ratio R follow similar patterns. All three orientations are E-W in central Kyushu, where the compressional strain is highest. Both splitting and stress suggest plate-boundary-parallel maximum principal stress just off the coast of Kyushu, where strain measurements are sparse. Southwestern Kyushu has the largest difference between strain and stress. Phi from shallow and deep earthquakes is not well correlated, suggesting that the deep earthquake waveforms are not simply re-split in the crust. Causes for the anisotropy may be olivine crystals aligned by drag of the subducting Phillipine Sea plate in the mantle and stress-aligned microcracks in the crust. We have begun inverting for 3-D anisotropic structure to determine the relation of the mantle anisotropy to plate flow.",

            "abstract": "Very large solar cycle (SC) variations are observed in the zonal winds and temperatures of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The effect is too large to be produced by the small SC variations of the solar flux in the lower stratosphere. Dynamical downward coupling must be involved, and we present a review of the mechanism that emerged from studies with the Numerical Spectral Model (NSM). In the NSM, the QBO is generated with parameterized gravity waves and planetary waves. For a SC period of 10 years, the applied heat source varies exponentially with altitude: 0.2% (surface), 2% (50 km), 20% (100 km and above). With that solar forcing, the model reproduces qualitatively the SC modulations of the QBO zonal winds around the equator and temperature variations extending to high latitudes. The QBO is spawned in the lower mesosphere by a hemispherically symmetric equatorial annual oscillation (EAO) of the zonal wind velocities. Though small in magnitude, the SC modulation of the EAO is large. Like the symmetric QBO, the EAO extends into the lower atmosphere under the influence of, and amplified by, wave mean flow interactions. The amplitude modulations of the QBO and EAO are in phase with the imposed SC heat source. Essentially, the EAO provides the pathway and pacemaker for the SC modulation of the QBO – and wave interactions amplify the oscillations as they propagate down into the lower atmosphere. Analysis of NCEP temperature and zonal wind data (1958 to 2006) produces the hemispherically symmetric equatorial annual oscillation (EAO), and it contains spectral signatures with periods around 11 years. Moving windows of 44 years show that below 20 km the 11-year modulation of the EAO is phase locked to the SC. The spectral features from the 48-year data record reveal modulation signatures of 9.6 and 12 years, which produce EAO variations that mimic in limited altitude regimes the varying maxima and minima of the 10.7 cm solar index. In the lower stratosphere, the 40-year record of NCEP data also shows that the zonal winds reveal a pronounced 5-year modulation of the symmetric EAO confined to equatorial latitudes. And this modulation is observed in temperature variations that extend to high latitudes. The NSM produces a 5-year oscillation through nonlinear interaction between the 30-month QBO and annual oscillation.",

            "abstract": "Statistical downscaling methods are widely used to reconcile the spatial and temporal difference between climate model outputs and input requirements of climate change impact assessments. Quantile-mapping, due to its simplicity and general good performance, is one of the most popular. However, its simplicity also leads to variations in the procedure among studies, and it is not always well cross-validated. There is also less attention paid to sub-daily precipitation downscaling which is important for urban hydrologic purposes. The study explores the potential of quantile-mapping by comparing four of its variations, and extends its application by linking it to an hourly k nearest-neighbor resampling disaggregation. The methods are trained with NCEP/NCAR 40-year reanalysis. Seven-fold cross-validation on various mean, variability, and extreme precipitation statistics is performed with hourly observations at rain gauges along the eastern coast of the United States. The best performance on mean monthly precipitation and annual maximum 5-day precipitation is found when quantile-mapping is trained without regard to seasonality. However, the best performance on all other statistics is contingent upon the method being trained separately for each month and combined with a monthly bias-correction factor. Deficiencies in quantile-mapping carry over to the hourly disaggregation step. When the downscaled daily precipitation is satisfactory, the hourly disaggregation performs very well on all statistics after careful selection of its two parameters. These results demonstrate the importance to consider seasonality in the implementation of quantile-mapping and highlight some clear, though limited, deficiencies. That it is feasible to generate realistic hourly precipitation series with easy-to-implement empirical methods is also of interest to water managers.",

            "abstract": "The product-to-parent reversion of metabolites of trenbolone acetate (TBA), a steroidal growth promoter used widely in beef cattle production, was recently observed to occur in environmental waters. The rapid forward reaction is by direct photolysis (i.e., photohydration), with the much slower reversion reaction occurring via dehydration in the dark. The objective of this study is to quantify the potential effect of this newly discovered reversible process on TBA metabolite concentrations and total bioactivity exposure in fluvial systems. Here, we demonstrate increased persistence of TBA metabolites in the stream and hyporheic zone due to the reversion process, increasing chronic and acute exposure to these endocrine-active compounds along a stream. The perpetually dark hyporheic zone is a key location for reversion in the system, ultimately providing a source of the parent compound to the stream and increasing mean in-stream concentration of 17α-trenbolone (17α-TBOH) by 40% of the input concentration under representative fluvial conditions. As such, regulatory frameworks for compounds undergoing product-to-parent reversion will require new approaches for assessing total exposure to bioactive compounds. Further, we demonstrate generalized cases for prediction of exposure for species with product-to-parent reversion in stream-hyporheic systems.",

            "abstract": "The northern Gulf of Mexico, including the subaqueous Mississippi River delta front (MRDF), has been productive for oil and gas development since the early 1900s. In 1969 cyclic seafloor wave loading associated with the passage of Hurricane Camille triggered subaqueous mudflows across the MRDF, destroying several offshore oil platforms. This incident spurred geophysical and geotechnical studies of the MRDF, which found that the delta front is prone to mass failures on gentle gradients (<0.5°) due to (1) high rates of fine-grained sedimentation and associated underconsolidation, (2) excess sediment pore pressure attributed to in-situ biogenic gas production, and (3) the frequent passage of tropical cyclones. In June 2014, a geophysical pilot study was conducted 8 km southwest of Southwest Pass, the distributary that currently receives the largest fraction of Mississippi River sediment supply. The resultant dataset encompasses 216 km of subbottom Chirp seismic profiles and a 60 km2 grid of bathymetry and sidescan data. Preliminary interpretation of these data shows the survey area can be classified into four primary sedimentary facies: mudflow gullies, mudflow lobes, undisturbed prodelta, and undisturbed delta front. Subbottom profiles reveal extensive biogenic gas from 20 to about 80 m water depths on the delta front; sidescan data show a variety of bottleneck slides, mudflow gullies and mudflow noses. Previous studies have attempted to constrain the periodicity and magnitude of subaqueous mudslides on the MRDF. However, large age gaps and varied resolution between datasets result in ambiguity regarding the cause and magnitude of observed bathymetric changes. We present high-temporal resolution MRDF bathymetric variations from 2005 (post Hurricane Katrina), 2009 (relatively quiescent storm period), and 2014 (post 2011 Mississippi River flood). These data yield better magnitude and timing estimates of mass movements. This exercise represents a first step towards (1) assembling a comprehensive geologic dataset upon which future MRDF geohazard assessments can be founded, and (2) understanding the dynamics of a massive passive margin deltaic lobe entering a phase of decline.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual variability over most of the tropics, and the performance of seasonal forecast models over such region is often related to how well they capture the regional teleconnection with ENSO. During the boreal winter monsoon, mean precipitation over much of the Maritime Continent is strongly correlated with ENSO phase. Over these regions, the prospect of accurate seasonal precipitation forecast is optimistic. Unfortunately, the ENSO signal in precipitation is known to be much weaker over the western Maritime Continent, which covers the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and west Java. We investigate the ENSO teleconnection with mean precipitation using simple statistics on merged observation-remote sensing and model hindcast products. These diagnostics suggest an additional reason for why the winter monsoon mean precipitation over the western Maritime Continent is poorly correlated with the ENSO phase, and why some forecast models may not reflect this observed situation. We make recommendations for some process-based forecast products that are desirable for the Western Maritime Continent.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost contains a large pool of carbon that has accumulated for thousands of years, and remains frozen in organic form. As climate warms, permafrost thaw will increase rates of microbial breakdown of old soil organic matter (SOM), accelerating release of carbon to the atmosphere. Higher rates of microbial decomposition may also release reactive nitrogen, which may increase plant production and carbon fixation. The net effect on atmospheric carbon, and the strength of climate feedback, depends on the balance between direct and indirect effects of increased microbial activity, which depends on changes in soil conditions and microbial responses to them. In particular, soil moisture and availability of C and N for microbes strongly influence soil respiration and primary production. Current understanding of changes in these factors as climate warms is limited. We present results from analysis of soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) from a long-term warming and drying experiment in subarctic Alaskan tundra (the CiPEHR experiment) as an indicator of changes in soil microbial activity and relative availability of C and N for microbes. We collected soil samples from control (C), warming (W), and warming + drying (WD) treatments and used fluorometric methods to estimate EEA in shallow (0-5 cm) and deep (5-15) soils. We measured soil moisture, SOM, and C:N, and plant tissue C:N as an indicator of N availability. Activity of N-acquiring enzymes was higher in WD soils at both depths. Carbon EEA in W soils was lower in surface, but higher in deeper soils. We also found significantly lower soil C:N in both W and WD in deeper soils, where C:N was generally lower than surface. In general, EEA results suggest drying leads to increased C availability relative to N. This may be due to lower soil moisture leading to greater aeration of soils in WD plots relative to W plots, which may be saturated due to significant land subsidence. Greater aeration may increase efficiency of carbon use by microbes, effectively increasing carbon availability for microbes in WD soils relative to W soils. This suggests that drying may reduce N recycling by microbes, potentially reducing plant production and increasing soil respiration relative to carbon fixation, increasing the likelihood that permafrost thaw will be a positive feedback on climate change.",

A new approach was developed to determine total porosity of materials as function of loading. The total porosity can divided into two portions, compliant porosity (φc(P)) and framework one (φr(P)). The former is well fitted by exponential function and reaches zero at the pressure Pcp – “compliant pore closure pressure”, and the latter described by a linear function. An interesting and startling phenomenon is that framework pores can survive in specimens beyond 450 MPa, even higher than 1000MPa. ρ and Vp linearly increase with pressurization at pressures beyond Pcp, however, the pressure derivatives of density (Dρ) and of velocity (Dv) are at least one order of magnitude higher than the counterparts of crystallized rocks. We attribute these higher values (Dρ and Dv) to the existence of pores within specimens even when pressure reaches 450 MPa.",

However, not all front-side CMEs can hit the Earth. Thus, which CMEs hit the Earth and when they do so are important issues in the study and forecasting of space weather. In our previous work (Shen et al., 2013), the de-projected parameters of the full-halo coronal mass ejections (FHCMEs) occurred from 2007 March 1 to 2012 May 31 were obtained, and there are 39 front-side events could be fitted by the GCS model. In this work, we continue to study whether and when these front-side FHCMEs (FFHCMEs) hit the Earth. It is found that 59% of these FFHCMEs hit the Earth, and for central events, whose deviation angles , which are the angles between the propagation direction and the Sun-Earth line, are smaller than 45 degrees, the fraction increases to 75%. After checking the deprojected angular widths of the CMEs, we found that all of the Earth-encountered CMEs satisfy a simple criterion that the angular width (ω) is larger than twice the deviation angle. This result suggests that some simple criteria can be used to forecast whether a CME could hit the Earth. Furthermore, for Earth-encountered CMEs, the transit time is found to be roughly anti-correlated with the de-projected velocity, but some events significantly deviate from the linearity. For CMEs with similar velocities, the differences of their transit times can be up to several days. Such deviation is further demonstrated to be mainly caused by the CME geometry and propagation direction, which are essential in the forecasting of CME arrival.",

            "abstract": "Multi-scale, finite-frequency tomography across the Himalayas-Tibet shows a clear, subhorizontal anomaly of high VP and VSin the upper mantle that can be traced from under N. India all the way to beneath central Tibet. This configuration of the “Greater India” (GI), or the submerged, northern portion of the Indian shield, is combined with other constraints to reconstruct position of the Indian lithospheric mantle (ILM) relative to Asia back to about 15 Ma ago, or the onset of the latest magmatic activity in Tibet. By then, the leading edge of the ILM (Indian mantle front, IMF) has advanced subhorizontally past the entire Lhasa terrane and also probably have caused the lithospheric mantle beneath the Qiangtang terrane to thicken. The thickening is likely to have led to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, causing widespread but small volume of magmatic activity in northern Tibet.\nMeanwhile, the detached lithospheric mantle foundered through the upper mantle to rest at the bottom of the mantle transition zone (MTZ), just above the lower mantle. This detached lithospheric mantle manifests itself as a large-scale seismic anomaly of high compressional wave speed (VP) but curiously is undetectable through shear-waves. Based on laboratory data for nominally anhydrous olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs (NAO), the discordant results between P- and S-waves is explained by abundant hydroxyls in the foundered lithospheric mantle, a hypothesis supported by other evidences as well. Since NAO can hold ~1 wt% of water throughout the upper mantle and the MTZ, foundering of thickened lithospheric mantle caused by continental collision is an under-appreciated but effective pathway for water to enter the deep mantle.\nCurrently, the Indus-Yarlung suture between northern India and the Lhasa terrane appears to be an inactive, crustal feature, as the GI continues to pass beneath it. On the other hand, even though the IMF has now advanced northward beyond the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS), which marks the suture between the Lhasa (southern Tibet) and the Qiangtang terranes (central Tibet) in the Mesozoic, the BNS seems to have been a zone of deformation over lithospheric scale when the IMF interacted with the Qiangtang lithosphere about 15 Ma ago. Indeed the Moho around this zone is highly disturbed, a feature not found elsewhere under Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Hindcasts of cyclonic wind fields are crucial for extreme analysis in the oil and gas industry. Recent scientific developments have increased the number of parameterization options for tropical cyclone vortices, leading to well over 8000 permutations of model choices. Which is best? Also problematic is how best to blend modelled vortex winds into a global wind model (such as the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)) in order to resolve tropical cyclones to sufficient detail for wave modelling. Standard blending schemes can leave a ‘moat’ between the vortex and the CFSR circulation (see Figure 1 from TC Olivia 1996).\nUsing a 35-year track database from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, this study assesses model configurations and blending schemes against the most extensive measured meteorological dataset in the north-east Indian Ocean (largely commercial-in-confidence). The Holland profile models of 1980 and 2008 are two starting points, with other options examined for radius to maximum wind calculations, pressure-wind relationships, averaging periods, atmospheric profiles, gust factors, and asymmetry methods. Once a vortex is modelled, the winds are then fitted to the radius of gales and blended into the CFSR before further verification. Initial results support recent theoretical developments by Hu et al (2012), with additional results that call for a new asymmetry method and the separation of pressure and wind field modelling.",

            "abstract": "The Taranaki-Ruapehu Line (TRL) is a geophysical boundary that runs east-west adjacent to the southern end of arc-volcanism in New Zealand. The TRL is defined by gravity, magnetotelluric, and seismic attenuation observations, which may be related to a proposed Moho “step”, yet the geometry of this step is not well constrained. Here we present an improved image of the Moho interface across the TRL, assembled from teleseismic receiver functions at 8 new temporary and 2 regional seismic stations, which augment a network of 7 temporary stations originally used to image the step. A total of 790 receiver functions from 17 stations and 281 earthquakes were arranged into geographical bins, then stacked to form a north-south Common Conversion Point (CCP) profile 130 km long and approximately centered on the TRL. Consistent with previous investigators, 2D velocity effects from basin sediments and station elevation are compensated for with a static time shift of the receiver functions, which were first rotated into the LQT (i.e. P-SV-SH) domain. Ray tracing and pre-stack depth migration then operated on a simple 1D velocity model. The new 17 station CCP profile compares favorably with the original 7 station profile; the extra data density improves attenuation of P multiples and results in noticeably clearer Ps converted phases along the profile, including better delineation of the previously identified crustal step where the Ps conversion deepens from ~25 km to ~35 km over a distance of several kilometers. Synthetic receiver functions have also been calculated for station-event pairs and formed into CCP stacks, and we assess the potential of synthetics as an interpretational tool for a large change in crustal thickness over a relatively short distance. We hypothesize that such a change in Moho depth may be related to dynamic mantle instabilities, such as subduction interaction at depth or a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, both of which have been proposed to occur in the vicinity of this study area.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphic and geodetic measurements of coseismic ground surface displacement due to the 2012 Mw=7.6 Nicoya, Costa Rica Earthquake are unprecedented datasets due to their proximal location relative to the megathrust seismogenic zone. This unique situation presents an opportunity for in-depth analysis of the plate interface geometry on which the earthquake occurred, and the surface displacement data that constrain coseismic slip models. Estimated coseismic slip on a strike-and-dip variant surface based on the USGS Slab1.0 model yielded a Mw=7.7 earthquake, producing 1.3x more moment than published values using dip-variant segmented planes. This is consistent with the depth contrast between Slab1.0 and the segmented planes, where the deeper surface geometry requires more slip to predict an equivalent amount of surface displacement. This result presents the possibility that the earthquake was larger than originally estimated, which has relevance to evaluating future seismic hazards and emphasizes the importance of considering the true plate interface geometry when estimating earthquake slip. \nDensely spaced geomorphic measurements of coseismic vertical displacement along the SW coast of the Nicoya Peninsula reveal local heterogeneities in deformation not captured by sparser geodetic data. Model-predicted vertical displacements better fit the geomorphic data as compared to the geodetic data, both in the context of spatial distribution and magnitude. This signifies that the slip distribution models using a strike-and-dip variant plate interface geometry can successfully fit local heterogeneities revealed by an independent dataset. This research has relevance to both Nicoya seismicity and earthquake research worldwide, as large-scale and interdisciplinary analysis of these unprecedented data provides insight into how we model earthquakes and analyze their hazards.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the technical analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assessed the economic risks posed to the United States by six categories of climate change impacts: crop yield, energy demand, coastal storm damage, criminal activity, labor productivity, and mortality [1]. At a national level, measured by impact on gross domestic product, increased mortality and decreased labor productivity pose the large risks, followed by increased energy demand and coastal damages. Changes in crop yield and crime have smaller impacts.\nThe ACP was not intended to conduct a benefit-cost analysis of climate change mitigation. It assessed the economic consequences of future impacts on an economy with a structure equivalent to that of the current economy, not accounting for socio-economic development and adaptation, and did not assess the cost of mitigation. One of its primary goals was to inform adaptation decisions that are conventionally considered 'endogenous' in economic analyses of climate change. Nonetheless, its results provide insight into the potential of mitigation to manage climate risk.\nDifferences between RCP 8.5 (moderately-high business-as-usual emissions), RCP 4.5 (moderate mitigation) and RCP 2.6 (extremely strong mitigation) are not apparent until mid-century and become significant only late in the century. For all impacts except coastal damages, mitigation significantly reduces uncertainty in late-century impact estimates. Nationally, mitigation significantly and monotonically reduces median projected labor productivity losses and violent crime.\nSwitching from RCP 8.5 to RCP 4.5 also significantly reduces median projections of mortality and energy demand, but the domestic value to the U.S. of further mitigation to RCP 2.6 is less clear. The marginal benefits decline in part because some regions of the country (especially the Northwest) may experience increased crop yields, reduced mortality, and reduced energy demand under all RCPs. Because of the slow response time of sea level to change in emissions, the coastal risk reduction in the current century from mitigation is least clear.\n",

            "abstract": "Assessing the influence of climate forcing on streamflow, and how it varies from place to place is an important component of catchment hydrology. A great number of studies have explored this issue analytically or empirically. One widely used framework is the Budyko curve, which describes catchments by the partition of precipitation between flow and evapotranspiration at annual scale. Both climate change and human activities such as water management and land use have important effects on the seasonal water balance. However, with the increased complexity of soil water storage change at seasonal scale, more research is needed to extend the Budyko framework for the intra-annual relationship between climate and streamflow. In this study, we extended the equation quantifying the propagation of variability from climate to runoff at annual scale to monthly scale. Besides the aridity index (AI), the variance ratio between soil storage change and precipitation as well as the covariance among the soil water storage, precipitation and evapotranspiration could also play significant roles in intra-annual variability. The new equation was then applied to 232 catchments across the continental US for validation. The calculated variance ratio and the observed variance ratio of runoff and precipitation agree reasonably well. The new relationship suggested that when the intra-annual variability in precipitation is larger, the amount of intra-annual variability propagating to streamflow is dominated by the annual AI. When the variability in precipitation is small, the interaction between soil water storage and climate has to be taken into account, which may be also related to the vegetation type. This new analytical framework will improve the understanding of the close interactions between climate, soil, vegetation and topography at the catchment scale, and has the potential to facilitate the parameterization of coupled ecological and hydrological processes in the land surface and earth system models.",

            "abstract": "We present SKS splitting measurements for the first two years of data collected by the Cascadia Initiative (CI) amphibious array. Our analysis includes observations from over 100 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS), as well as 31 onshore stations, and spans both the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates. The CI dataset is unique in that it includes several regions that can distinctly influence anisotropic fabric development such as: the upwelling mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges, the young evolving oceanic lithosphere of the plate interior, the Blanco transform fault, and the Cascadia subduction zone. For the first time, we are able to analyze these regions with a single dataset, and using a common methodology. Splitting measurements are routinely done on land sites, but have been completed on relatively few OBS stations. This is largely due to the low signal to noise present in OBS data, which can obscure the splitting results. To address that nearly all the OBS data exceeds the global high noise limit at the frequencies used for splitting, we implement a rigorous quality control scheme. Our method specifically takes into account the response of common splitting methods to high noise data and addresses known issues such as cycle skipping, false minima, low transverse energy, and near-null measurements. Individual measurements are filtered at 0.03-0.1 Hz, manually checked for quality, and stacked. Preliminary results show trench perpendicular onshore measurements consistent with previous studies. Oceanic measurements in the plate interior show a coherent fast axis roughly aligned with absolute plate motion. Several measurements near the ridge and trench appear to be rotated in the ridge and trench parallel directions. Continuing work will integrate splitting measurements from the final two years of the CI with these findings, which will be used to characterize the ridge-to-trench mantle flow across the Juan de Fuca plate system.",

            "abstract": "We recently discovered a material, aqueous dispersions of colloidal nanoparticles, whose rheology depends strongly on solid particle fraction fp, being Newtonian at low fp, and presenting yield stress, shear thinning, elasticity, and brittle properties as fp increases. Moreover, the rheology is time-dependent, with shear stress causing damage, which can heal due to electrostatic interactions between the colloidal particles. The competition between damage and healing results in long-term weak zones. Such a behaviour is analogue to the rheology of mantle rocks as temperature decreases.\nWe therefore undertake a systematic laboratory study of convection in such fluids, where the system is continuously cooled and dried from above and heated or not from below. As the dispersion is dried, a skin (\"lithosphere\") forms at the surface on the convective fluid, and instabilities develop on several scales as shear bands (0.01 mm-scale), folds (mm-scale), fractures (0.1-10 mm-scale), small-scale convection (cm-scale) and plates (2-20 cm-scale). The system always describes several dynamic regimes through time: an initially very soft lithosphere would result in a stagnant lid regime of convection, which can then evolve in episodic and/or partial subduction, sometimes continuous plate tectonics, and finally stagnant lid. Regime diagrams will be presented as a function of the effective rheology of lithosphere. This \"effective\" rheology depends on the cascade of instabilities at smaller scales, thanks to which it is much weaker than the material properties measured on small samples.",

            "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous-Eocene granitoids and mafic rocks are widely exposed in the Motuo tectono-magmatic belt (southeast Lhasa terrane). LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating shows that the granitoids have magma crystallization ages of 83 and 71-45 Ma, and the mafic rocks have magma crystallization ages of 69-50 Ma. The 83 Ma granitoids exhibit adakitic characteristics (high Sr/Y ratios) and display weakly evolved Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition (whole-rock ISr=0.7060 to 0.7065, εNd(t)=-3.0 to -0.3, and zircon εHf(t)=-4.2) . The 71-45 Ma granitoids have slightly variable Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition (whole-rock ISr=0.7056 to 0.7100, εNd(t)=-4.0 to +3.0, and zircon εHf(t)=-4.0 to +10.8). The chemical composition of the mafic rocks is comparable with low-MgO high-alumina basalts to basaltic andesites. These mafic rocks also have weakly evolved Sr-Nd-Hf composition (whole-rock ISr=0.7064 to 0.7086, εNd(t)=-3.4 to +1.2, and zircon εHf(t)=-3.8 to +6.4). Whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic and zircon Hf isotopic data suggest that the 83 Ma adakitic granitoids were derived from partial melting of over-thickened lower crust, the 71-45 Ma granitoids result from diverse magma sources including both juvenile and reworked mature crustal materials, and the mafic rocks were derived from partial melting of metasomatised lithospheric mantle. Our compilation of new and published data from the eastern Lhasa terrane granitoids show a marked variation in Sr/Y ratios and a step change in Sr-Nd isotope compositions during the Late Cretaceous. Besides, a synthesis of available whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data on lithospheric mantle-derived basalts provides an insight into the different secular evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath the central part and the eastern part of the southern Lhasa terrane. In the central part of the southern Lhasa terrane, the Paleocene to Eocene basaltic rocks exhibit variable Sr-Nd isotopic composition. However, Sr-Nd isotopic composition of the Motuo Late Cretaceous-Eocene mafic rocks argue that they were derived from partial melting of an relatively homogeneous and depleted lithospheric mantle. We propose that the Late Cretaceous delamination resulted in the replacement of ancient lithospheric mantle by the juvenile homogeneous lithospheric mantle in the eastern Lhasa terrane.",

            "abstract": "We investigate spreading pathways of basal meltwater released from all Antarctic ice shelves using a circumpolar coupled ice shelf-sea ice-ocean model that reproduces major features of the Southern Ocean circulation, including the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Several independent virtual tracers are used to identify detailed pathways of basal meltwaters. The spreading pathways of the meltwater tracers depend on formation sites because the meltwaters are transported by local ambient ocean circulation. Meltwaters from ice shelves in the Weddell and Amundsen--Bellingshausen Seas in surface/subsurface layers are effectively advected to lower latitudes with the ACC. Although a large portion of the basal meltwaters is present in surface and subsurface layers, a part of the basal meltwaters penetrates into the bottom layer through active dense water formation along the Antarctic coastal margins. The signals at the seafloor extend along the topography, showing a horizontal distribution similar to the observed spreading of Antarctic Bottom Water. Meltwaters originating from ice shelves in the Weddell and Ross Seas and in the Indian sector significantly contribute to the bottom signals. A series of numerical experiments in which thermodynamic interaction between the ice shelf and ocean is neglected regionally demonstrates that the basal meltwater of each ice shelf impacts sea ice and/or ocean thermohaline circulation in the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "There are clear variations in maximum earthquake magnitude among Earth’s subduction zones. These variations have been studied extensively and attributed to differences in tectonic properties in subduction zones, such as relative plate velocity and subducting plate age [Ruff and Kanamori, 1980]. In addition to maximum earthquake magnitude, the seismicity of medium to large earthquakes also differs among subduction zones, such as the b-value (i.e., the slope of the earthquake size distribution) and the frequency of seismic events. However, the casual relationship between the seismicity of medium to large earthquakes and subduction zone tectonics has been unclear. Here we divide Earth’s subduction zones into over 100 study regions following Ide [2013] and estimate b-values and the background seismicity rate—the frequency of seismic events excluding aftershocks—for subduction zones worldwide using the maximum likelihood method [Utsu, 1965; Aki, 1965] and the epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model [Ogata, 1988]. We demonstrate that the b-value varies as a function of subducting plate age and trench depth, and that the background seismicity rate is related to the degree of slab bending at the trench. Large earthquakes tend to occur relatively frequently (lower b-values) in shallower subduction zones with younger slabs, and more earthquakes occur in subduction zones with deeper trench and steeper dip angle. These results suggest that slab buoyancy, which depends on subducting plate age, controls the earthquake size distribution, and that intra-slab faults due to slab bending, which increase with the steepness of the slab dip angle, have influence on the frequency of seismic events, because they produce heterogeneity in plate coupling and efficiently inject fluid to elevate pore fluid pressure on the plate interface. This study reveals tectonic factors that control earthquake size distribution and seismicity rate, and these relationships between seismicity and tectonic properties may be useful for seismic risk assessment.",

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations indicate that the GIS albedo has dropped since the early part of this century. We analyze data from the MODIS products MOD10A1 for broadband snow albedo and MOD09A1 for surface spectral reflectance since 2001 to better explain the physical mechanisms driving these changes. The MODIS products are filtered, and the data is masked using microwave-derived surface melt maps to isolate albedo changes due to dry snow processes from those driven by melt impacts. Results show that the majority of recent changes in the GIS albedo - even at high elevations - are driven by snow wetting rather than dry snow processes such as grain metamorphosis and aerosol impurity deposition. The spectral signature of the smaller changes occurring within dry snow areas suggests that grain metamorphosis dominates the albedo decline in these regions.",

            "abstract": "Inland flooding causes billions of dollars of damage in the United States each year, and these amounts could increase with more extreme precipitation events. We use flood damage data from the National Climatic Data Center to examine the nature of historical flood damages in the continental United States. Using the location information for each flood event, we link each damaging flood to the nearest stream channel, and to the nearest meteorological station from NCDC. Using this combined dataset, we find that 1) flood events associated with first order streams (typically <300 km2) account for approximately 50% of inland flooding damages nationwide; 2) the number of damaging events in the historical record decreases as a power function of stream order; and 3) the distribution of monetary damages per event is similar across all stream orders. Using this information, we evaluate potential changes in monetary damages from flooding of small catchments under different climate change scenarios. We extract daily precipitation data from the historical record for each damaging event, and determine the approximate recurrence interval of the precipitation associated with each flood event. Then, using modeled daily precipitation projections from the IGSM-CAM model, we project regional changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events under two climate change mitigation scenarios compared to a reference scenario. For each scenario, we translate changes in flood frequency into flood damages using the observed historical distribution of damages. We then compile damage projections by region and by scenario to estimate the potential monetary value of inland flooding damages averted by climate change mitigation policies.",

            "abstract": "Among all the rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean, the three great Siberian rivers; Lena, Yenisei and Ob, are the three largest in terms of water discharge (R), and they are a large source of freshwater. While linear trends of the Rs have been examined in many previous studies, causes of the R variations are still unclear. As pointed out in Fukutomi et al. (2003), during the 1980s to mid-1990s, the observed R of the Lena was negatively correlated with that of the Ob. The precipitation (P) and net precipitation (P-E) also showed negative correlation. These variations were affected by the east-west seesaw pattern of atmospheric circulation and associated moisture transport over Siberia. Our analysis, including records from recent years, revealed that the correlation of the R becomes weak after the mid-1990s, and it was positive during the mid-1950s to 1960s. These results indicated that the relationship between the observed Rs of the Lena and Ob was different in each epoch during the past seven decades. Reconstructed Rs based on the tree-ring during the past two centuries also showed positive and negative correlations in each of the epochs. Interestingly, the correlations were distributed on the negative side. This implies that the east-west seesaw pattern frequently appeared over Siberia. In addition, control simulation with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) suggested that the east-west seesaw pattern appears as an atmospheric internal variability over Siberia. In conclusion, the atmospheric circulation which affects the P variations over Siberia was different in each epoch during the past two centuries, and as a result the relationship between the Rs of the Lena and Ob Rivers were changed in each of the epochs.",

            "abstract": "The Rungwe Volcanic Province is the southernmost expression of volcanism in the East African Rift System. Rungwe magmatism is focused in a transfer zone between two weakly extended rift segments, unlike more developed rifts where magmatism occurs along segment axes (e.g. mid-ocean ridges). Rungwe was selected as the site of the multinational SEGMeNT project, an integrated geophysical, geochronological and geochemical study to determine the role of magmatism during early stage continental rifting. Argon geochronology is underway for an extensive collection of Rungwe volcanic rocks to date the eruptive sequence with emphasis on the oldest events. The age and location of the earliest events remains contested, but is critical to evaluating the relationship between magmatism and extension. Dated samples are further analyzed to model the geochemistry and isotopic signature of each melt’s source and define it as lithospheric, asthenospheric, or plume.\nGiven the goals, the geochronology focuses on mafic lavas most likely to preserve the geochemical signature of the mantle source. Groundmass was prepared and analyzed at the LDEO AGES lab. Twelve preliminary dates yield ages from 8.5 to 5.7Ma, consistent with prior results, supporting an eruptive episode concurrent with tectonic activity on the Malawi and Rukwa border faults (Ebinger et al., JGR 1989; 1993). Three additional samples yield ages from 18.51 to 17.6 Ma, consistent with the 18.6 ±1.0 Ma age obtained by Rasskazov et al. (Russ. Geology & Geophys. 2003). This eruptive episode is spatially limited to phonolite domes in the Usangu Basin and a mafic lava flow on the uplifted Mbeya Block. These eruptions predate the current tectonic extensional structure, suggesting magmatism predates extension, or that the two are not highly interdependent. No Rungwe samples dated yet can be the source of the of 26Ma carbonatitic tuffs in the nearby Songwe River Basin sequence (Roberts et al., Nature Geoscience 2012). Isochron ages from mica separates of two carbonatite complexes upstream in the drainage basin were dated and yield Jurassic ages of 165.7 ±1.3 Ma for Panda Hill and 154.2 ±0.9 Ma for Mbalizi, older than prior age estimates (Bowden, Nature 1962; Pentel’kov & Voronovskly, Doklady Akad Nauk 1977). These results leave the source of tuffs in the Songwe River Basin unresolved.",

            "abstract": "A foreland (Ganges) and a suture (Brahmaputra) river, which both drain the Himalaya, have coalesced to form Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD), the world’s largest. The GBD progrades along the continental margin, coupled with an advancing subduction to collision transition, deforming the delta as it grows. A better understanding of this time-transgressive system is urgent now that humans are increasing their forcing of the system and exposure to environmental hazards. Among these, earthquake risk is rapidly growing as people move from rural settings into expanding cities, creating unprecedented exposure. The megathrust 1950 M8.7 earthquake in Assam occurred during the monsoon and released 10x the annual sediment load, causing progradation at the coast and a pulse of river widening that propagated downstream. The 1762 M8.8(?) along the Arakan coast extended into the shelf of the delta where coastal tsunami deposits have been identified recently. These events bracket a segment with no credible historic megathrust earthquakes, but could affect far more people. Geodetic and geologic data along this 300 km boundary facing the GBD show oblique contraction. The subaerial accretionary prism (Burma Ranges) is up to 250 km wide with a blind thrust front that reaches ½ way across the delta. The GPS convergence rate of 14 mm/y is consistent with large displacements and long interseismic times, which can account for lack of historic ruptures, but also the potential for catastrophic events. Active folds and shallow thrust earthquakes point to an additional threat from upper-plate seismicity. Much of the current seismicity is in the lower-plate and reaches as far west as Dhaka; it may pose an immediate threat. The folds, and the uplift and subsidence patterns also influence the courses of the rivers. North of the delta, the Shillong plateau is a huge basement cored anticline bounded by the north-dipping Dauki thrust fault. 7 mm/y of N-S shortening and 5 km of structural relief here are consistent with a Pleistocene age for the structure. Subsidence of its foreland has created the seasonal inland sea in Sylhet and influences avulsions of the Brahmaputra. The 1897 M8.0 earthquake caused maximum intensities on the western part of the Shillong massif, suggesting a rupture of the western Dauki fault, leaving the eastern portion as a possible gap.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of global climate during the past 34 million years is characterized by a transition from warm conditions with unipolar continental glaciation, to the bipolar ice sheets of the present. Much of our knowledge about the chronology of cryosphere development is based upon deep-sea benthic foraminiferal δ18O compilations that integrate global ice volume and regional deep ocean temperature. To deconvolve these mixed signals, the reconstruction of global ice volume typically requires the application of temperature proxy methods and/or global climate/ice-sheet models. These approaches have proven powerful, yet contribute their own uncertainty, particularly when the ice-volume signal is small. In this study we consider a novel means to constrain Cenozoic glaciation history through an assessment of the stochastic component of climate, using a new composite benthic d18O record, noise parameter estimation, and quantitative sedimentation models. We demonstrate that the relatively long climate response time diagnostic of continental ice sheets is imparted on observed stochastic benthic foraminiferal d18O variability, and is quantifiable using “noise response time” (NRT). Evaluation of changes in NRT using the new d18O composite identifies the proposed Cenozoic glaciation (“Oi” and “Mi”) events - as well as some new events - and provides new evidence for their magnitudes. Overall, assessment of the d18O composite in the context of stochastic variability provides unique insights into climate system history, complementing the evaluation of astronomical forcing/pacing, and yielding new quantitative constraints on previously ambiguous aspects of cryosphere development during the Cenozoic.",

In all cases, coupling is accomplished via fundamental processes such as reconnection and plasma waves, and can be between regions, energy ranges, species, scales, and energy reservoirs. Three views of geospace are required to attack system level questions. First, we must observe the fundamental processes that accomplish the coupling. This “observatory view” requires in situ measurements by satellite-borne instruments or remote sensing from powerful well-instrumented ground-based observatories organized around, for example, Incoherent Scatter Radars. Second, we need to see how this coupling is controlled and what it accomplishes. This demands quantitative observations of the system elements that are being coupled. This “multi-scale view” is accomplished by networks of ground-based instruments, and by global imaging from space. Third, if we take geospace as a whole, the system is too complicated, so at the top level we need time series of simple quantities such as indices that capture important aspects of the system level dynamics. This requires a “key parameter view” that is typically provided through indices such as AE and DsT. With the launch of MMS, and ongoing missions such as THEMIS, Cluster, Swarm, RBSP, and ePOP, we are entering a-once-in-a-lifetime epoch with a remarkable fleet of satellites probing processes at key regions throughout geospace, so the observatory view is secure. With a few exceptions, our key parameter view provides what we need. The multi-scale view, however, is compromised by space/time scales that are important but under-sampled, combined extent of coverage and resolution that falls short of what we need, and inadequate conjugate observations. In this talk, I present an overview of what we need for taking system level research to its next level, and how high latitude ground based observations can address these challenges.",

            "abstract": "Surface temperature (ST) plays a critical role in land-atmosphere-ocean interactions, and is one of the fundamental variables for Earth system research. ST includes surface air temperature (SAT), surface skin temperature (Ts), and subsurface water or soil temperature at a given depth [T(z)]. In this presentation, we will review our recent work on land and ocean ST.\nOver land, we have developed the first global 0.5 deg hourly SAT datasets from 1948-2009 by merging in situ CRU data with reanalysis data. Using these datasets, over high latitudes in winter the monthly averaged diurnal temperature range is found to be much larger than the range of monthly averaged hourly temperature diurnal cycle. The former primarily reflects the movement of synoptic weather systems, while the latter is primarily affected by the diurnal radiative forcing. We have also compared Ts from satellite remote sensing (MODIS) and land modeling (CLM) with in situ measurements. For instance, we have identified five factors contributing to the Ts differences between the model and MODIS.\nOver ocean, we have developed a prognostic Ts parameterization for modeling and data analysis. For instance, the inclusion of the Ts diurnal cycle affects atmospheric processes at diurnal, intraseasonal, and longer time scales. Furthermore, our parameterization provides the relationship between water temperature T(z) at different depths and Ts, and hence helps to merge temperature data from satellite infrared and microwave sensors and in situ buoy and ship measurements.",

            "abstract": "With the launch of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suit (VIIRS) instrument onboard Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership(S-NPP) in late 2011, the aerosol products of VIIRS are receiving much attention.To date, mostevaluations of VIIRS aerosol productswere carried out about aerosol optical depth (AOD). To further assess the VIIRS AOD in China which is a heavy polluted region in the world,we made a comparison between VIIRS AOD and CE-318 radiometerobservation at the following three sites overNorth China Plain (NCP): metropolis-Beijing (AERONET), suburbs-XiangHe (AERONET) and regional background site- Xinglong (CARSNET).The results showed the VIIRS AOD at 550 nm has a positive mean bias error (MBE) of 0.14-0.15 and root mean square error (RMBE) 0.20. Among three sites, Beijing is mainly a source of bias with MBE 0.17-0.18 and RMBE 0.23-0.24, and this bias is larger than some recent global statics recently published in the literature. Further analysis shows that this large bias in VIIRS AOD overNCP may be partly caused by the aerosol model selection in VIIRS aerosol inversion. According to the retrieval of sky radiance from CE-318 at three sites, aerosols in NCP have high mean real part of refractive indices (1.52-1.53), large volume mean radius (0.17-0.18) and low concentration (0.04-0.09) of fine aerosol, and small mean radius (2.86-2.92) and high concentration (0.06-0.16) of coarse mode aerosol. These observation-based aerosol single scattering properties and size of fine and coarse aerosols differ fromthe aerosol properties used in VIIRSoperational algorithm.The dominant aerosol models used in VIIRS algorithm for these three sites are less polluted urban aerosol in Beijing and low-absorption smoke in other two sites, all of which don’t agree with the high imaginary part of refractive indices from CE-318 retrieval. Therefore, the aerosol models in VIIRS algorithm are likely to be refined in NCP region.",

            "abstract": "To assess time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard for Taiwan, we develop a new approach and implement the state-of-the-art parameters of seismogenic sources obtained by Taiwan Earthquake Model (TEM). Based on the information on tectonic setting, geology, geomorphology, and earthquake catalog, four categories of seismogenic source were identified. Those are: (a) regional source, (b) crustal fault source, (c) subduction interface source, and (d) subduction intraslab source. For the treatment of time-dependency, both long-term and short-term impacts are considered. In order to evaluate seismic probability evolution during a long-term period, several recurrence interval models for crustal fault sources were introduced. We examined their feasibility through comparison with observed return periods acquired from excavation data. By implementing occurrence time of last event obtained by instrumental and historical catalogs, long-term evolutions of the occurrence probabilities for crustal fault sources were obtained. The results show lower occurrence probabilities for the faults, which just ruptured at a recent time. For evaluation of short-term rate change, earthquake interaction between different sources in form of stress change was investigated. An increased stress state promoted occurrence of consequent events, while stress decrease inhibits future seismic activity. Through considering ground motion prediction equations for different types of sources and site conditions, time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard was assessed. Obtained high hazards can mainly be attributed to the crustal active faults with short recurrence intervals or/and long elapsed time of the last events. Thus, higher hazards were evaluated near the active faults in the Coastal Plain in western Taiwan and along the Longitudinal Valley to the East. In northern Taiwan, by contrast, a low hazard level is obtained. It corresponds to inactive tectonics and faults in this region as well as its vicinity. Generally, since there is no significant large events took place recently in Taiwan, the short-term impact in current version is trivial. The time-dependent hazard map can be updated when a significant event take place in the future.",

            "abstract": "The strongly time-averaged nature of molluscan and other biogenic carbonate skeletons in seabeds is an under-appreciated uncertainty in paleoenvironmental inference using geochemical proxies. An extensive shell-dating program on the southern California shelf using AMS-calibrated amino-acid racemization corroborates the strongly right-skewed “L-shape” of shell-age frequency distributions (AFDs) found elsewhere. In California, the median age of aragonitic bivalve shells (2-7 mm, no size effect detected) is generally <100 y (5 of 8 assemblages have medians <50 y), and maximum measured ages are ~2550 to ~11,900 y. Modeling reveals that shells undergo an initial high disintegration rate λ1 (~decadal half-lives) but shift abruptly, within the first ~500 y postmortem, to a 100-fold lower disintegration rate λ2 (~ millennial half-lives) at sequestration rate τ (burial and/or diagenetic stabilization). This drop permits accrual of a long tail of very old shells even when sequestration is very slow, allowing only a minority (<1%) of shells to survive the first phase (Tomasovych et al. 2014 Geology). We suspect that permanent diagenetic stabilization may be necessary to ensure that shells do not revert to λ1 after temporary sequestration in favorable pockets within the mixed layer. Preliminary SEM shows significant coarsening of inner shell-layer crystallites, consistent with Ostwald ripening. New cores from 50-m water depth document such L-shaped AFDs in each 2-cm increment within the upper ~25 cm of the seabed, the local penetration depth of callianassid shrimp, indicating both upward and downward advection of shells. AFDs from deeper core increments, cut off from the input of new shells, have flat (uniform) shapes with millennial-scale median ages; shells at these depths represent the 1% that survive λ1 and are then almost impervious to further destruction. The importance of sequestration (stabilization) to the prolonged persistence of shells and the likely remodeling of shell microstructure, all within the mixed layer, and the coarser temporal resolution of permanently buried shell assemblages, underscore the need to acquire a suite of replicate measurements per increment and to assume that some porewater equilibration of original shell has likely occurred.",

            "abstract": "One persistent mode of outgassing from Kīlauea’s summit lava lake, which has been active since 2008, is characterized by dome-shaped upwellings of incandescent lava several meters across on the lake surface. These phenomena usually occur a few times per minute during the lava lake’s typical north-to-south circulation regime, dampen and disappear within seconds, and produce few pyroclasts. Up until now, it has not been possible to determine if these upwellings were caused by the bursting of discrete bubbles or by rafts of smaller bubbles, though their slow speed and relative lack of pyroclasts suggested the latter.\nHowever, observations of these phenomena during 2013–14 using high-speed (200–500 Hz) cameras found a surprising result. Each dome-shaped upwelling was, instead, the aftermath of the bursting of a discrete bubble, which broke through the surface crust a few tenths of a second before the related upwelling and was roughly one-quarter to one-half its size. Thus, these upwellings appear to be the rebound of the lava lake surface into the void created by relatively minor, meter-scale bubble bursts. In some instances, the rebound even develops into a liquid jet.\nRebound of the lava lake surface following wall rock collapses has been shown to be important for triggering transient explosive activity at Kīlauea since 2008. The dome-shaped upwellings described here are another example of lake-rebound dynamics at Kīlauea, though on a smaller scale. In light of the prevalence of these phenomena at Kīlauea, rebound of the magma column following disturbances at the magma free-surface could play a role in other volcanic systems as well.",

Temperature data from 5 stations and precipitation data from 20 stations were used based on quality and long term availability of data. Twenty-seven core extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI) were calculated using computer software RClimDex. General increasing trend has been observed in the temperature extremes. Most stations show increase in percentage of warm days and nights whereas the cool nights and cool days are found to be decreasing. The trend is of relatively higher magnitude in mountainous region. Changes in indices of precipitation showed mixed pattern and do not show substantial, spatially coherent trends, unlike the situation for temperature means and extremes. The trends of very wet and extremely wet days have been found to be increasing in majority of stations with decreasing in rainy days. Results also show that, all the stations have positive trend of Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) and 60% of the stations show negative trend of Consecutive Wet Days (CWD). Since increase in extreme weather and climate events have greater negative impacts on human society and natural environments than changes in climate means, this study may be useful for policy makers for the development of climate resilient societies.",

            "abstract": "Glacier surface velocity is a combination of the internal deformation of ice and basal slip (including till deformation overlying bedrock) (Cuffey and Paterson, 2010). Short-term velocity changes can be attributed to basal slip associated with water pressure changes because of both the seasonal meltwater input and the evolution of the englacial and subglacial hydrological system. Thus, examining the velocity changes with high spatial and temporal resolution is helpful to understand how subglacial conditions evolve and control the surface velocities.\nWe examined spatial and temporal velocity changes at quiescent surge-type glaciers near the border of Alaska/Yukon by SAR offset tracking and found significant acceleration from fall to winter regardless of surge events. Moreover, whereas the upstream propagating summer speed-up was observed, the winter speed-up propagated from upstream to downstream. Lingle and Fatland (2003) proposed the englacial water storages as the fundamental driver of temperate-glacier surge. Although our observations were performed at the quiescent and rather poly-thermal than temperate surge-type glaciers, our observations also support the englacial water storage hypothesis. Namely, the englacial water storages that do not directly connect to the surface can promote basal sliding through increased water pressure as winter approaches.\nGlacier surge often initiates in winter (Raymond, 1987), which has been explained by creep closure of efficient drainage system in fall and subsequent higher water pressure in winter. Mini-surges are also known in this area, and have been interpreted in a similar mechanism. However, in order to maintain the higher water pressure for some time period in winter, there should be such sources that can keep supplying the water to the bed. It has been uncertain, however, if, how and where the water can be stored in winter. Also, we should keep in mind that many of the previously known mini-surges were actually occurring in spring and summer (Kamb and Engelhardt, 1987; Harrison and Post, 2003). There are, to our knowledge, few comprehensive velocity observations in terms of both spatial and temporal coverages.\nHere we review some previous observations, place our observations in context of the glacier surge dynamics, and propose the winter speed-up mechanism.",

            "abstract": "How the Tibetan Plateau is extended is one of the key problems to understand the earth crust evolution in the frame of plate tectonics. A newly uplifting area, the Dahe region, locating between the Yumu Shan Mountain and the Qilian Shan Mountain, in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, would supply us a fresh sight on the process that how the plateau is extended to a new region. The Dahe region was a relatively depressing or stable area before late Pleistocene, and received thick fluvial sediment derived from the Qilian Shan in the south. In late Pleistocene, the old depositing surface Sp (alluvial fan surface) was deeply cut by the Dahe River. Below the old depositing surface, four staircases of strath terraces (strath is the old fluvial deposition) are formed by the Dahe River, and each terrace surfaces are buried by aeolian loess. By the OSL dating on overlying loess on the terraces and correlating to climate records, we obtain formation ages (terrace surface abandoning time) of the four terraces (from high to low): 128.2 ±9.8 ka, 109.6±20.8 ka, 96.3 ±9.0 ka, and 15.9 ±2.5 ka. We obtain the extrapolated Sp age of 160 ±25 ka, which represents the time when the fan depositing was end and river cutting and eroding was started in the Dahe region. By the uplifted terrace staircases and warped long profiles of terraces, we can find that the region is not only experiencing regional uplifting but also folding deformation. Through analyzing the geometry of the deforming terrace surfaces, we propose that a new blind thrust fault was derived from the main decollement in the upper crust, and thus the growing fault deduced the uplift of the Dahe region and the folding near the fault tip. The growth of the Dahe region, which is sandwiched by the Yumu Shan and the Qilian Shan, both uplifted millions years ago, suggests that northeastern extending of the plateau is in the form of new fault-fold system growing in mountain front and back.",

            "abstract": "We apply a global three-dimensional Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to quantify the decadal trend and interannual variation of aerosol outflow from East Asia. Simulations of aerosols are performed for years 1986–2006, driven by the NASA/GEOS-4 assimilated meteorological fields. The impacts of variations in meteorological parameters and emissions are imposed separately and together by numerical experiments. With variations in both meteorological parameters and anthropogenic emissions, simulated annual outflow of PM2.5 (sum of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, and organic carbon) from East Asia increased by 6.0 Tg (or 53%) over years 1986–2006, in which the outflow fluxes of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium aerosols had the largest contributions with decadal trends of +1.2, +0.8, and +0.7 Tg decade−1, respectively. Simulated outflow fluxes of aerosols also exhibited large interannual variations; the absolute percent departure from the mean (APDM) values of the annual outflow fluxes of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic carbon, and PM2.5 were 5.9%, 7.9%, 5.4%, 5.8%, 4.2%, and 5.2%, respectively, as variations in both meteorological parameters and anthropogenic emissions were considered. Model sensitivity studies show that, for outflow fluxes of aerosols from East Asia, the decadal trends were driven by variations in anthropogenic emissions whereas the interannual variations were dominated by variations in meteorological parameters. The increases in anthropogenic emissions alone explained about 86% of the decadal trend in outflow of PM2.5. Although variations in meteorological parameters can influence the interannual variations in aerosol outflow by changing both aerosol concentrations over East Asia and zonal winds, the latter is identified to be the key factor because of the high positive correlation coefficient between the annual outflow flux of PM2.5 and zonal wind at 700 hPa (the altitude with the maximum outflow fluxes) for years 1986–2006.",

            "abstract": "Advances in sensor technology and wireless networking are making environmental data available at unprecedented sampling frequency and with unprecedented spatial coverage. These measurements are allowing us to observe phenomena and process interactions that were previously invisible. This talk will present examples of promising developments spurred by the sensor revolution in hydrological sciences.\nCaution is needed, however, in interpreting these high-frequency observations. Typical environmental time series have reddened spectra, implying that as measurements are made at finer temporal or spatial intervals, the measured values will be closer together as well. Above some sampling frequency, successive real-world values will differ by less than the measurement uncertainties themselves, with the result that the measured time series will be dominated by measurement noise rather than real-world dynamics.\nEnvironmental sensors, like all measurement devices, will be characterized by noise spectra, and environmental signals will only be observable in frequency ranges where they are much stronger than the measurement noise. Thus it is important to know the noise spectra of environmental sensors, through long-term time series measurements on standards and blanks. To date, however, measurement noise spectra have rarely been measured or reported.\nThe reddened spectra of environmental fluctuations imply that measurements at sufficiently high frequencies will mostly \"connect the dots\" between nearby data points. In other words, measurements at higher and higher sampling frequencies will be more and more strongly autocorrelated, with the result that the number of effective degrees of freedom in the time series will be far smaller than the number of measurements. Statistical analyses of such time series will greatly exaggerate significance levels, and greatly underestimate confidence bounds, unless this loss of degrees of freedom is taken into account. Illustrative examples of these pitfalls will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The various types of rainfall-dependent coupled socioecological systems that conspicuously characterize mountain-environments across Africa, such as the Chagga homegardens, an intensive agroforestry system, constitute a major economic backbone to the local inhabitants. Similarly, agropastoralism that characterizes the adjoining rangelands of such mountain-environments, such as that practiced by the Maasai people of Kenya, in the northern plains that adjoins Mount Kilimanjaro, is major contributor to local food security. Both Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism also contribute greatly to broader-scale economic sectors and respectively to sustainable utilization of rangeland and mountain-environment resources. Like similar coupled socioecological systems across Africa, the Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism are being, and will continue to be affected by the changing climate. This study uses an integrated approach to explore the sustainability of Chagga homegardens, an intensive agroforestry system, in the southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Concurrently, the sustainability of the Maasai agropastoralism (a livelihood-diversification type) in the northern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the adjoining plains in Kenya is explored. This explication is followed by conceptualization of the potential future of Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism systems under diverse scenarios of climate change—and alongside simultaneous effects of cross-scale social and biophysical factors, processes, and their interactions—in an integrated model. The premise of this study is that coupled socioecological systems, such as Chagga agroforestry and Maasai agropastoralism, linked to and/or dependent on mountain environments and microclimates, are natural-laboratories. Apropos this last point, the two systems offer timely insight into how similar systems in different geographical locations are likely to be influenced by the continuously changing climate amidst simultaneously heightened permeation of global socioeconomic and sociopolitical change. This insight become important as climate-influenced agriculture and pastoralism and their various derivatives continues to dominant livelihood systems across Africa.",

            "abstract": "Increasing the capacity of society to make informed climate decisions based on scientific evidence is imperative. While a wide range of education programs and communication efforts to improve understanding and facilitate responsible effective decision-making have been developed in recent years, these efforts have been largely disconnected. The interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary nature of the problems and potential responses to climate change requires a broad range of expertise and a strategy that overcomes the inherent limitations of isolated programs and efforts.\nTo extend the reach and impact of climate change education and engagement efforts, it is necessary to have a coordination that results in greater collective impact. The Collective Impact model, as described by Kania & Kramer (2011), requires five elements: 1) a common agenda; 2) shared measurement systems; 3) mutually reinforcing activities; 4) continuous communication; and 5) a well-funded backbone support organization.\nThe CLEAN Network has facilitated a series of discussions at six professional meetings from late 2012 through spring 2014 to begin to develop and define the elements of collective impact on climate change education and engagement. These discussions have focused on getting input from the community on a common agenda and what a backbone support organization could do to help extend their reach and impact and enable a longer-term sustainability. These discussions will continue at future meetings, with the focus shifting to developing a common agenda and shared metrics.\nIn this presentation we will summarize the outcomes of these discussions thus far, especially with respect to what activities a backbone support organization might provide to help increase the collective impact of climate change education effort and invite others to join the development of public-private partnership to improve the nations climate literacy.\nThe cumulative input into this evolving discussion on collective impact on climate literacy can be viewed at http://tinyurl.com/mgwndtr.",

            "abstract": "Long time-series computations of seasonal and flood event inundation volumes from archived forecast rainfall events for the Lower Zambezi basin (Mozambique), using a coupled hydrology-hydrodynamic model, are correlated and regressed with satellite soil moisture observations and NWP rainfall forecasts as predictors for inundation volumes. This dynamic library of volume predictions can then be re-projected onto the topography to generate the corresponding floodplain and wetland inundation dynamics, including periods of flood and low flows. Especially for data-poor regions, the application potential of such a library of data is invaluable as the modeling chain is greatly simplified and readily available. The library is flexible, portable and transitional. Furthermore, deriving environmental indicators from this dynamic look-up catalogue would be relatively straightforward. Application fields are various and here we present conceptually a few that we plan to research in more detail and on some of which we already collaborate with other scientists and international institutions, though at the moment largely on an unfunded basis. The primary application is to implement an early warning system for flood inundation relief operations and flood inundation mitigation and resilience. Having this flood inundation warning system set up adequately would also allow looking into long-term predictions of crop productivity and consequently food security. Another potentially high-impact application is to relate flood inundation dynamics to disease modeling for public health monitoring and prediction, in particular focusing on Malaria. Last but not least, the dynamic inundation library we are building can be validated and complemented with advanced airborne radar imagery of flooding and inundated wetlands to study changes in wetland ecology and biodiversity with unprecedented detail in data-poor regions, in this case in particular the important wetlands of the Zambezi Delta.",

            "abstract": "Walker Lake, Nevada, contains locally abundant Pleistocene and Holocene carbonate structures, including tufas, stromatolites, and lithified carbonate hardgrounds. Hardgrounds are classically interpreted as forming via geobiological processes in shallow sediments. To better understand the origins of ancient hardgrounds, we investigated modern firmgrounds which we hypothesized to be incipient hardgrounds. The studied firmgrounds were brown, 1-2 cm thick with a mm-scale white or brown crust, cohesive enough to retain sharp erosional features, and were located on the western shoreline where alluvial fans enter the lake. We analyzed the elemental composition of the lakewater and porewaters in order to model mineral saturation states under lake conditions. In addition, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene diversity of the firmgrounds, porewater of adjacent sediments, and lakewater to investigate potential biological involvement. This, combined with SEM imaging, XRD analyses, and EDS analyses indicate that the firmgrounds are likely dominated by clays and granitic minerals rather than carbonate like the ancient hardgrounds. We suggest that Walker Lake firmgrounds are formed by weathering of unstable granitic minerals with no clear biological influence, likely resulting from physio-chemical processes related to groundwater-lake water mixing. Such firmgrounds may undergo subsequent replacement by calcium carbonate to form hardgrounds, resulting in carbonates with δ13C and δ18O compositions that do not reflect the lake water in which they formed. Given the apparent influence of groundwater on their formation, our work suggests that caution should be used when interpreting lacustrine hardground isotopic records as indicators of lakewater chemistry and climate.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage into the shallow aquifer is one of the main concerns at a CO2 sequestration site. Various hydrogeochemical parameters have been suggested to determine the leakage (i.e., pH, EC, Alkalinity, Ca and δ13C). For the practical point of view, direct and continuous measurement of the dissolved CO2 concentration at the proper location can be the most useful strategy for the CO2 leakage detection in a shallow aquifer. In order to enhance possibility of identifying leaked CO2, monitoring location should be determined with regard to the shallow aquifer heterogeneity. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of heterogeneity on the dissolved CO2 concentrations. A 2-D sand tank of homogeneous medium sands including a single heterogeneity layer was designed. Two NDIR CO2 sensors, modified for continuous measuring in aquatic system, were installed above and below the single heterogeneous layer (clay, fine and medium sand lenses). Also, temperature and water contents were measured continuously at a same position. Bromocresol purple which is one of the acid-base indicator was used to visualize CO2 migration. During the gas phase CO2 injection at the bottom of the sand tank, dissolved CO2 in the water is continuously measured. In the results, significant differences of concentrations were observed due to the presence of heterogeneity layer, even the locations were close. These results suggested that monitoring location should be determined considering vertical heterogeneity of shallow aquifer at a CO2 leakage site.",

            "abstract": "A micromechanical model is developed to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process. The model comprises two key components. Firstly, the solid matrix, assumed as a rock mass with pre-fabricated cracks, is represented by an array of bonded particles simulated by the Discrete Element Model (DEM)[1]. The interaction is ruled by the spheropolyhedra method, which was introduced by the authors previously and has been shown to realistically represent many of the features found in fracturing and communition processes.\nThe second component is the fluid, which is modelled by the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). It was recently coupled with the spheropolyhedra by the authors and validated. An advantage of this coupled LBM-DEM model is the control of many of the parameters of the fracturing fluid, such as its viscosity and the injection rate. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first application of such a coupled scheme for studying hydraulic fracturing[2]. In this first implementation, results are presented for a two-dimensional situation. Fig. 1 shows one snapshot of the LBM-DEM coupled simulation for the hydraulic fracturing where the elements with broken bonds can be identified and the fracture geometry quantified.\nThe simulation involves a variation of the underground stress, particularly the difference between the two principal components of the stress tensor, to explore the effect on the fracture path. A second study focuses on the fluid viscosity to examine the effect of the time scales of different injection plans on the fracture geometry. The developed tool and the presented results have important implications for future studies of the hydraulic fracturing process and technology.\nreferences\n1.

            "abstract": "Magma-water interaction (MWI) influences both eruption style and resulting pyroclast grain size (and transport properties). We explore both the mechanisms and consequences of MWI by examining tephra deposits from the 2500BC Hverfjall Fires within the Krafla fissure system, northern Iceland. Here, contemporaneous fissure vents spanned sub-aerial to shallow lacustrine environments, causing both dry magmatic and variably wet phreatomagmatic activity. As all vents shared the same initial magma composition, the range of pyroclastic (ash fall, wet surge, dry surge and scoria) deposits provides an excellent sample suite to explore fragmentation mechanisms under different near-surface conditions. Sample analysis of the opening phreatomagmatic phase shows that ash components of individual size fractions exhibit a linear increase [from 8% (1φ) to 77% (>4φ)] in the proportion of dense blocky fragments with decreasing size (Figure). The proportion of vesicular particles decreases concurrently, but shards comprise an increasing proportion of the vesicular size fraction [from 6% (1φ) to 70% (>4φ)]. Free crystals, lithic and microcrystalline grains are ~10% of all size classes. We compare these morphological data to (1) bubble size distributions (BSDs) and (2) the spatial distribution of preserved volatiles in matrix glass, which record the degassing history and pressure/rate of quenching, respectively. Measured BSDs for quenched Pele’s tears within the opening phreatomagmatic ash deposit show a modal bubble diameter of 20–30 µm (by number) or 150–200 µm (by volume), comparable to those from Kilauea Iki fire fountains in Hawaii. Elevated dissolved sulphur concentrations (≤ 550 ppm) in phreatomagmatic ash compared to magmatic scoria (~180 ppm), however, suggests either faster quench rates and/or greater fragmentation depths. To discriminate between these alternatives, we analyse BSDs in ash from the magmatic phase, which requires determining the optimal particle size for BSD analysis: small particles do not preserve the volumetrically important large bubbles, while large particles experience post-fragmentation expansion. Finally, comparing BSDs to grain size distributions demonstrates the importance of bubbles in localizing thermal stresses during phreatomagmatic fragmentation.",

It is therefore a critical component for representing the energy-water nexus in earth system models. The stream temperature particularly in large river systems is very often regulated by human activities such as reservoir and power plant operations. This study is a first attempt to develop a physically based stream temperature model within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. The Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) has been developed to represent riverine water dynamics and incorporated into CESM by coupling with the Community Land Model (CLM). Here we build upon CLM-MOSART to represent the riverine transport of heat along with water flux and the energy exchanges between river water and the atmosphere. More importantly, the impacts of reservoir and power plant operations are also explicitly parameterized within this new stream temperature model. This new stream temperature model will first be driven by historical forcing and validated against the observed stream temperature at a number of USGS gauges across the US. Then, driven by dynamically downscaled climate change scenarios, the relative contributions of climate change and reservoir and power-plant operation on the projected spatiotemporal changes in stream temperature will be systematically analyzed. Lastly the current limitations and future directions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The 2.4–2.2 Ga collision-related magmatism had once been considered to be weak or lacking, and were interpreted to represent the stagnation and deceleration of plate subduction. However, large-scale intermediate to acid intrusions at 2.4–2.2 Ga are widely reported in the Trans-North China Orogen and Tarim Craton, NW China. Here we presented geochronological and geochemical and Nd-Hf isotopic studies of the Hudesheng and Delingha granitoids in the Quanji Massif, which could shed new light on the NW China and global tectonics in the Paleoproterozoic.\nThe two granitoids are exposed in the eastern and central parts of the Quanji Massif, showing similar rock types and including mainly the syenogranitic, monzogranitic and adamellitic gneisses, with ~2.41 Ga low P/T-type amphibolite enclaves. They were formed at 2.37–2.39 Ga and underwent medium P/T-type amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ~1.95–1.90 Ga. Both granitoids have relatively high Si, K contents and FeO*/Mg, 104Ga/Al ratios, and are characterized by a relative enrichment in LILEs and LREEs, but depletion in Ba, Sr, Eu and Nb. These signatures are similar to those of the high-K calc-alkaline I-type granites, and with some geochemical features of A-type granites as well, suggesting that their formation might be related to a post-collisional setting with transition from compression to extension regimes at ~2.4 Ga. The whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf isotopes suggest important crustal growth occurred at ~2.5–2.8 Ga, and the precursor magmas of both granitoids were derived from partial melting of the Neo-Archean juvenile and ancient crustal components.\nCollectively, the ~2.37–2.39 Ga magmatic activities in the Quanji Massif took place right after arc-related metamorphism and arc-continent collision, thus probably making up part of the arc-related ~2.4–2.2 Ga magmatic activities, including those in the Trans-North China Orogen and Tarim Craton, NW China. This implies that a prolonged strong subduction-accretion-collision process occurred in the North China, consistent with those magmatic events having been discovered recently worldwide.\nThis study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 40972042, 41172069 and 41372075)",

            "abstract": "Despite a plethora of field studies and modeling efforts, there remains substantial debate concerning the relative roles of Tibetan Plateau uplift and of global climate change in pacing the Cenozoic evolution of climate in Asia. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms requires knowledge of both moisture transport pathways and topography in Asia through time. Here, we reconstruct the long-term spatial distribution of oxygen isotopes in precipitation in Asia since the early Eocene to examine the relative influence of changing topography and of global climate. We use both new paleosol δ18O data from Mongolia and a compilation of δ18O data from 2,650 paleosol and lacustrine carbonate samples and compare these data with modern precipitation/river δ18O. Across Asia, the spatial distribution of paleo-precipitation δ18O remains remarkably similar through time, with low δ18O in the lee of the Himalaya in southern Tibet, intermediate values in central Tibet, and constant, high δ18O in Central Asia. The long-term consistency in the spatial distribution of δ18O strongly suggests that the same atmospheric processes that today govern Asian climate have been operating since the early Eocene; in contrast, uplift of the Plateau over the Cenozoic has had little impact on moisture delivery to Asia. It thus seems that only a high, southern topographic barrier is necessary to both block southerly moisture and drive monsoonal circulation, supporting recent, modern GCM studies. We combine these results with an isotope-enabled reactive transport model to show that the mid-latitude westerlies have maintained extensive recycling of the cross-Eurasian moisture flux through evapotranspiration, which has kept Central Asia arid to semi-arid for more than 50 Ma. Further, any topographic δ18O signal due to uplift of the northern Plateau has been overprinted by this westerly evapotranspirative recycling flux. We conclude that the climatic impact of the India-Asia collision was set by the early Eocene with subsequent Plateau uplift having little effect on monsoonal circulation or Central Asian aridity. Instead, it is the mid-latitude westerlies that have translated the effects of global climatic changes into Central Asia and driven the evolution of Central Asian aridity.",

The troctolites are divided into three groups based on textural diversity; “skeletal olivine-bearing”, “fine-grained” and “coarse-grained” troctolites.\nFor major- and trace-element compositions of olivine and plagioclase, the skeletal olivine-bearing and fine-grained troctolites are more evolved (olivine Fo and NiO contents, 83 to 86 and 0.08 to 0.2 wt.%, respectively, and plagioclase An content, 77 to 84) than coarse-grained ones (olivine Fo and NiO contents, 87to 89 and 0.2 to 0.3 wt.%, respectively, and plagioclase An content, 85 to 90). Clinopyroxenes show scattered chemical compositions in the skeletal olivine-bearing and fine-grained troctolites, down to the scale of a single thin section. Clinopyroxenes, some of which show no Eu anomaly, are clearly zoned in the coarse-grained troctolites: the rims are chemically more evolved than the cores.\nThe skeletal olivine-bearing and fine-grained troctolites record signs of melt invasion, which caused the chemical heterogeneity of the clinopyroxenes. In contrast, the coarse-grained troctolites show no such sign, and contain the zoned clinopyroxenes, which were co-precipitated with plagioclases. MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) melts experience multi-stage evolution, including fractional crystallization and melt/troctolite interaction during migration. Such various melt migration processes in the lower oceanic crust possibly cause regional diversity of MORB chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of overall melt content beneath mid-ocean ridges inferred from magnetotelluric tomography (MT) studies vary widely between 1 and 10 vol. %. Much of this variation may arise from a lack of understanding about how melt geometry influences the bulk electrical conductivity of partially molten mantle rock, especially at low melt fraction. We present results from experiments in which we numerically calculate the electrical conductivity and permeability using high-resolution, three-dimensional melt geometries of olivine-basalt systems obtained via synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXμT).\nStarting materials consist of San Carlos olivine and Fo90 basalt mixed in various proportions to achieve nominal melt fraction of 0.02 to 0.20 when melted. Samples were prepared by isostatically pressing samples at 1.5GPa and 1350°C for a minimum of 1 week (Zhu et al., 2011; Science) and then quenched, turning the melt to basaltic glass. Samples were imaged using SXμT at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Labs to obtain three-dimensional, 700 nm-per-pixel digital reconstructions. Grayscale data was segmented using Avizo® software (Miller et al., 2014; EPSL), and binary images were used as computational domains in numerical experiments to determine bulk electrical conductivity and permeability.\nNumerical experiments were carried out on several statistically representative subvolumes per sample using finite difference techniques. Olivine and melt are treated as conductive and insulative phases, respectively. To calculate conductivity, Laplace’s equation is solved for the electric potential, assuming zero electric flux across phase boundaries. Ohm’s Law yields the bulk conductivity of the sample. To calculate permeability, Stokes’ equations are solved using the artificial compressibility method on a staggered grid. Darcy’s law then gives the permeability of the subvolume.\nWe fit permeability and electrical conductivity values to power laws in order to establish empirical relationships with melt fraction. We compare with experimental studies. By linking permeability and electrical conductivity to melt content, we are able to better guide interpretations of geophysical data and constrain melt connectivity and transport at mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "Future freshwater availability is a pressing issue in Texas due to frequent drought events and fast population growth. Even though the science community has well investigated future temperature trends, it is still unclear whether precipitation will increase or decrease in this region. Furthermore, there is a lack of understanding on how the changing climate will affect water resources across different spatial-temporal scales. This study aims to quantify the impacts of climate change on surface hydrology at the basin scale under different future emission scenarios. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, forced by an ensemble of statistically downscaled climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, is employed to predict the future hydrology. The VIC model parameters are adopted from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) at a spatial resolution of 1/8°. The CMIP5 projections contain four different scenarios in terms of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) (i.e. 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 w/m2). The analysis is carried out in three steps. First, the observed streamflows are used to evaluate the performance of VIC simulations forced by CMIP5 models during historical period. Second, VIC outputs under multiple CMIP5 model scenarios from 1950 to 2099 are analyzed to identify how soil moisture, evapotranspiration, runoff, and routed streamflows change in time and space. Third, the spatial patterns of seasonal temperature, seasonal precipitation, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)—over four 20-year periods (1980-1999, 2010-2029, 2040-2059 and 2080-2099)—are used to pinpoint the regions that will be most affected by climate change (among the 13 Texan river basins). Furthermore, the role of groundwater in meeting the increasing needs for water supply is discussed. The results are expected to contribute to various future water resources management decisions in Texas.",

            "abstract": "This poster summarizes geochemical, biological, hydrological, and watershed data that characterize Manzanita Lake, a small sub-alpine catchment in Lassen Volcanic National Park, CA. The future objective is to use characteristics of this system to interpret variations in diatom and sediment composition dating back to the 1914 Mt. Lassen eruption from a recently recovered lake core. Manzanita Lake is a small (0.18 km2) lake with a ~30 km2 watershed area situated on the northwest flank of Mt. Lassen, one of the most active Cascade volcanoes, and is a valuable recreational spot for anglers and visitors. Hydraulic residence time is short; roughly 119 days, and is derived from lake volume (1.0 X 106m3) and estimates of stream inflow (~6 ft3/sec) and outflow (~3 ft3/sec) that were made from May 2014 sampling data. Limnological sampling in 2012-2014 suggests that Manzanita Lake exhibits stable thermal stratification in the summer months, which is unusual given the shallow depth (~10m), but possibly supported by the morphometry of the lake basin and inputs of cold snowmelt from the flank of Lassen Peak. The lake is a moderately conductive (100-114 μS), mesotrophic system with secchi depths ranging from 8m to the bottom (~10m). Total phosphorus (TP) ranges from 15-25 ppb and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from 2-15 ppb, with ammonium in the epilimnion being the largest contributor. A high concentration of silica (Si) in surface water inputs (34 mg/L) to Manzanita Lake likely reflects the rhyodacitic bedrock geology and large drainage ratio (164) of the watershed. Variations in Si concentration in the lake seem to be coupled with diatom production. During the sampling period Manzanita Lake is has been dominated by diatom blooms throughout the summer and fall months. There is a seasonal succession in the diatom species present, with abundant Asterionella formosa in the spring, transitioning to abundant Fragilaria crotonensis in the summer months, to a mixed dominance of Fragilaria crotonensis and Aulacoseira species in the fall. Persistence of diatom species with moderate to high Si requirements throughout the summer is atypical and may be related to high Si (11-29 mg/L in lake), TP, and DIN. These data provide a modern baseline with which to interpret down-core changes in diatom composition and diversity over the last century.",

The object of this study is to know the change of water environment and to do water resource management effectively by studying the interaction between groundwater and river water in Yangsu-ri of Korea. This paper used methods using temperature profiles, EC values, DO values and radon tracer.\n In this study, diurnal and seasonal variation of radon value was measured with other values. The result values proved that the more the region was influenced by river water, the closer to the values of river water the result values are. The radon value indicated a similar pattern with other values. The analysis also applied river water stage change by dam discharge. In addition, the mixing modeling of groundwater and river water was conducted to confirm the difference between the calculated value and the measured value. It turned out that radon tracer can be used as environmental tracer for analysis of the interaction between groundwater and river water.",

A paleoseismological study of faults and fault-related folds comprising the Mount Narryer fault zone (MNfz) in the southern WASZ reveals a late Quaternary history of repeated morphogenic earthquake occurrence that has profoundly influenced the planform and course of the Murchison, Roderick, and Sanford Rivers. Folding in the near surface sediments is the predominant style of surface expression of reactivated basement faults which is consistent with other neotectonic structures throughout the Western Australia shear zone. CRN and OSL estimates of exposure and burial ages of fault-related folds and fold derived colluvium provide constraint on Late Quaternary slip rates on the underlying faults of ~0.05 - 0.1 mm/a. In the case of the Roderick River fault scarp, 2-3m high tectonic risers separating inset terraces where the Murchison River crosses the scarp are consistent with multiple late Quaternary seismic events on the order of magnitude Mw 7.1-7.3.

            "abstract": "After the 2008 Ms8 Wenchuan Earthquake (WE) occurred on Longmenshan thrust fault in the western Sichuan region in China, a long-time debate has arisen on whether there are some correlations between this huge earthquake and a large water reservoir, the Zipingpu Reservoir (ZR), which locates only about 10 km away from this event. Many geophysicists have studied the ZR issue but got different conclusions. So it is worth our attention to make more thorough investigation to figure out the possible effect of ZR impoundment on 2008 WE.\nWe investigate this issue by applying Matched Filter Technique (MFT) in the region around ZR, to better understand the local seismicity in this area.\nMFT is originally used to detect duplicated events, thus is not able to find new events with different locations. So we make some improvement on this method. Firstly we adopt the idea proposed by David Shelly et al. (Nature, 2007) to conduct a strong detection and a weak detection simultaneously, which enables us to find more micro-events. Then, we relocate the detected events, which provides us with more accurate spatial distribution of new events as well as the geometry of related faults, comparing with traditional MFT. In the meeting, we will introduce the temporal variation of spatial distribution of earthquakes around ZR from the initial impoundment of the reservoir in August, 2004 to the WE in May, 2008, and tell how the ZR might be involved with the destructive event.",

            "abstract": "Most recent methods in ionospheric tomography are based on the inversion of the Total Electron Content (TEC) measured by ground-based GPS receivers. As a consequence of the high frequency of the GPS signal and the absence of horizontal ray paths, the electron density structure is mainly reconstructed in the F2 region (300 km), where the ionosphere reaches the maximum of ionization, and is not sensitive to the lower ionospheric structure. We propose here a new tomographic method of the lower ionosphere, based on the full inversion of over-the-horizon (OTH) radar data. Previous studies using OTH radar for ionospheric tomography inverted only the leading edge echo curve of backscatter ionograms. The major advantage of our methodology is taking into account, numerically and jointly, the effect that the electron density perturbations induce not only in the speed of electromagnetic waves, but also on the ray-path geometry. This last point is extremely critical for OTH radar inversions as the emitted signal propagates through the ionosphere between a fixed starting-point (the radar) and an unknown end-point on the Earth surface where the signal is backscattered. We detail our ionospheric tomography method with the aid of benchmark tests. Having proved the necessity to take into account both effects simultaneously, we apply our method to real data. This is the first time that the effect of the ray-path deflection has been quantified and that the ionospheric plasma density has been estimated over the entirety of Europe with an OTH radar.",

            "abstract": "The accelerated exploration for and development of unconventional gas plays around the world has raised public concern about potential risks to human health and the environment. In this study, a risk assessment framework specific to shale gas development is proposed. The framework aims to quantify and/or qualify both risk and resilience within a water-energy nexus context, using a comprehensive approach that considers environment, health and policy. The risk assessment framework is intended to be flexible so that it can be used in different regions, but will be tested in North East British Columbia, Canada where shale gas development is rapidly expanding. The main components of risk include hazards, susceptibility and potential consequences, which will be evaluated in space and time using ArcGIS software. The hazards are associated with all phases of shale gas development and include: water, air, and soil contamination; water use (surface and groundwater), and land use disturbance, and their assessment will take into account where they may occur, their frequency, duration and magnitude. Hazard-specific susceptibility maps will be generated based on the physical characteristics of the environment (e.g. soil, geology, hydrology, topography) as well as water source information (e.g. well locations), community footprints, etc. When combined with an evaluation of potential consequences, the resulting set of spatial risk maps can then be used for water resource management, land use planning, and industry permitting. Resilience, which buffers risk, here considers the existing regulatory framework and whether or not existing regulations can mitigate risk by reducing the hazard potential or consequences. The study considers how regulations may fully, partially, or inadequately mitigate the consequences of a given hazard. If development is to continue at its current pace in North East BC, it is imperative that decision-makers recognize the changing risk and resilience profiles and respond with appropriate policy. A critical component of the study comprises a gap analysis of current regulation and a possible path forward.",

            "abstract": "Oasification and desertification are the two main land surface processes contrarily correlated with each other in arid regions. It is useful for environmental indication research to clarify the relationship between plants and environment under the oasification and desertification processes in arid regions. In the Heihe River basin, the most representative areas of oasification and desertification in China, we carried out a study to test whether or not we can use plant and soil stable isotope signature as an indicator of changes in key land surface process. Stable carbon (δ13C) of plant leaves, hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes of plant stem water and potential water sources were analyzed to investigate the water use efficiency (WUE) and water sources of different plant species in three typical habitats (oasis, oasis-desert transitional zone, desert). The results suggest that plants in the desert habitat tended to use water from deeper soil layer (>160 cm). In the oasis-desert transitional zone, Artimisia arenaria and Calligonum mongolicum were likely used water mainly from the soil layer about 20-40 cm in depth, Haloxylon ammodendron utilized water primarily from 60-80 cm in depth, Hedysarum scoparium may use water from soil layer about 100 cm in depth and Tamarix ramosissima obtained its water from deeper soil layer(>120 cm). Plants in the oasis habitat used soil water mainly from 0 to 100 cm soil layers. Calamagrostis pseudophragmites used water about 20 cm in depth, Zea mays extracted soil water from the depth of 20-40 cm, and Tamarix ramosissima and Populus simonii obtained soil water about 60 cm in depth. The δ13C values of C3 plants in each habitat differed significantly. In the oasis zone, WUE of shrubs were more positive than this of grass, which were similar to the conclusions of the previous studies. Among the three habitats, plants in oasis-desert transitional zone had the most positive δ13C values whereas plants in oasis area had the most negative values. This pattern may have resulted from soil texture, soil water content and plant water sources differences among the habitats. Overall, the results of our study illustrated that plant and soil isotope composition are useful for the indication of the processes of oasification and desertification in arid regions.",

It is funded by the ministry of science and technology of the people’s republic of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. TanSat will monitor carbon dioxide in Sun-Synchronous orbit by a hyper resolution grating spectrometer – Carbon Dioxide Sensor. A wide field of view moderate resolution imaging spectrometer - Cloud and Aerosol Polarization Imager (CAPI) will measure the aerosol and cloud properties synchronously.\nTanSat project turned to Critical Design Phase after Preliminary Design Review on June 2013, and it plan to finish Critical Design Review on December 2014 and launch on July 2016.\nA multi-bands retrieval algorithm has been developed to approach XCO2 with applying O2A band observation to reduce aerosol and cirrus cloud influence. The state vector list has been modified from previous two-bands algorithm by adding aerosol model parameters, cirrus cloud model parameters and linear correction on O2A bands. Application of TanSat XCO2 retrieval Algorithm on GOSAT Observation (ATANGO) has been developed from multi-bands TanSat algorithm. GOSAT observation has been used in retrieval experiment of ATANGO. A preliminary inter comparison test has been carried out with the XCO2 product of University of Leicester (UoL) full physics algorithm. The bias of 1.2 hPa (~0.1%) and 2.4ppm (~0.6%) of surface pressure and XCO2 between ATANGO and UoL were indicated, and the standard deviation of 2.8hPa (~0.28%) and 1.23ppm (~0.3%) of surface pressure and XCO2 between ATANGO and UoL were found.\nThe Ground-based observation network of XCO2 in China was developed, which include three Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IFS-125) over Xinglong, Beijing, Shenzhen, and three Optical Spectrum Analyzers (OSA) over Shangdong, Hainan Island, and Dunhuang, with different latitude and background. The measurement spectrum has been investigated with a full physics optimal estimation algorithm and a DOAS like algorithm. The aerosol and cloud observation network measurement provided information on aerosol and cloud optical properties distribution in China, and it will be helpful to develop a more reliable priori data in future XCO2 algorithm study.",

            "abstract": "Organic aerosol contribute a significant mass fraction of ambient aerosol carbon and can continuously undergo oxidation by colliding with gas phase OH radicals. Although heterogeneous oxidation plays a significant role in the chemical transformation of organic aerosol, the effect of molecular structure on the reactivity and oxidation products remains unclear. We investigate the effect of branched methyl groups on the reactivity of two dimethylsuccinic acids (2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid (2,2-DMSA) and 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid (2,3-DMSA)) toward gas phase OH radicals in an atmospheric pressure aerosol flow tube reactor. The oxidation products formed upon oxidation is characterized in real time by the Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART), an ambient soft ionization source. The 2,2-DMSA and 2,3-DMSA are structural isomers with the same oxidation state (OSC = -0.33) and carbon number (NC = 6), but different branching characteristics (2,2-DMSA has one secondary carbon and 2,3-DMSA has two tertiary carbons). The difference in molecular distribution of oxidation products observed in these two structural isomers would allow one to assess the sensitivity of kinetics and chemistry to the position of branched methyl group in the DMSA upon oxidation.\nWe observe that the reactivity of 2,3-DMSA toward OH radicals is about 2 times faster than that of 2,2-DMSA. This difference in OH reactivity may attribute to the stability of the carbon-centered radical generated after hydrogen abstraction because an alkyl radical formed from the hydrogen abstraction on a tertiary carbon in 2,3-DMSA is more stable than on a secondary carbon in 2,2-DMSA. For both 2,2-DMSA and 2,3-DMSA, the molecular distribution and evolution of oxidation products is characterized by a predominance of functionalization products at the early oxidation stages. When the oxidation further proceeds, the fragmentation becomes more favorable and the oxidation mainly leads to the reduction of the carbon chain length through the carbon-carbon bond cleavage. We provide molecular information to access how the position of the branched methyl groups plays a role in determining the kinetic and chemistry and to support the recent hypothesis that the relationship between average aerosol elemental composition (e.g., OSC) and oxidation pathways is not always unique.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor compliance measures the elastic response of the ocean bottom to water pressure fluctuation, and is a function of the elasticity of the sediment/crust. We have measured seafloor compliance from OBS data at two sites on the Okinawa trough (OT), which results from continental rifting, and one site on the Ryukyu arc (RA), a crustal block separated by the OT from the Eurasian plate, in the vicinity of Taiwan. Because the water depth is known and the sediment thickness can be estimated from seismic studies, this study offers a comparison in crustal properties between rifting and non-rifting environment. We performed both grid search and minimum-structure inversion for Vs. The models that best explain the compliance data indicate that the shear velocity of the upper crust of the RA is higher than that in the OT. This implies that the extension of the OT may cause significant faulting/fracturing of the brittle part of the crust and lower its shear modulus. Between the 2 OT sites, the Vs is lower for the OBS more distant from Taiwan. This observation is consistent with the scenario in which the crust is faulted and weakened more as rifting process intensifies from the edge of the Okinawa trough.",

            "abstract": "Isoprene-derived SOA formation has been studied extensively in the laboratory. However, it is still unclear to what extent isoprene contributes to the overall SOA burden over the southeastern US, an area with both strong isoprene emissions as well as large discrepancies between modeled and observed aerosol optical depth. For the low-NO isoprene oxidation pathway, the key gas-phase intermediate is believed to be isoprene epoxide (IEPOX), which can be incorporated into the aerosol phase by either sulfate ester formation (IEPOX sulfate) or direct hydrolysis. As first suggested by Robinson et al, the SOA formed by this mechanism (IEPOX-SOA) has a characteristic fragmentation pattern when analyzed by an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) with enhanced relative abundances of the C5H6O+ ion (fC5H6O). Based on data from previous ground campaigns and chamber studies, we have developed a empirical method to quantify IEPOX-SOA and have applied it to the data from the DC3 and SEAC4RS aircraft campaigns that sampled the SE US during the Spring of 2012 and the Summer of 2013. We used Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to extract IEPOX-SOA factors that show good correlation with inside or downwind of high isoprene emitting areas and in general agree well with the IEPOX-SOA mass predicted by the empirical expression. According to this analysis, the empirical method performs well regardless of (at times very strong) BBOA or urban OA influences. On average 17% of SOA in the SE US boundary layer was IEPOX-SOA.\nOverall, the highest concentrations of IEPOX-SOA were typically found around 1-2 km AGL, several hours downwind of the isoprene source areas with high gas-phase IEPOX present. IEPOX-SOA was also detected up to altitudes of 6 km, with a clear trend towards more aged aerosol at altitude, likely a combination of chemical aging and physical airmass mixing. The unique instrument package aboard the NASA-DC8 allows us to examine the influence of multiple factors (aerosol acidity, aerosol water content, sulfate mass fraction, isoprene and terpene source strength) to the relative and absolute contribution of IEPOX-SOA to the total OA burden. In particular, the IEPOX-sulfate measurement from the PALMS instrument was used to estimate the relative contribution of the organosulfate channel to the IEPOX-SOA formation.",

Then we use part of this catalog to study the 22 October 1999 (Mw 5.6) earthquake sequence near the city of Chiayi, Taiwan, where a damaging earthquake occurred a century ago. We have derived the change in the duration of the apparent source time functions (ASTFs) using a new Empirical Green Function Deconvolution method to estimate the mainshock rupture propagation processes. Preliminary results show the mainshock ruptured on the NNE-SSW trending right-lateral strike-slip fault and propagated toward SSW direction. To further characterize the faulting, we are using a finite fault inversion code developed by Dreger and Kaverina (2000) to derive a slip distribution model of this mainshock.

            "abstract": "Steve Schneider was a strong proponent of considering the entire range of possible climate-change outcomes. He wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of low probability/high consequence outcomes as well as most likely outcomes. He worked tirelessly on communicating the risks from overlapping stressors. Technical and conceptual issues have made it difficult for Steve’s vision to reach maturity in mainstream climate-change research, but the picture is changing rapidly. The concept of climate-change risk, considering both probability and consequence, is central to the recently completed IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and the concept frames much of the discussion about future research agendas.\nFraming climate change as a challenge in managing risks is important for five core reasons. First, conceptualizing the issue as being about probabilities builds a bridge between current climate variability and future climate change. Second, a formulation based on risks highlights the fact that climate impacts occur primarily in extremes. For historical variability and future impacts, the real concern is the conditions under which things break and systems fail, namely, in the extremes. Third, framing the challenge as one of managing risks puts a strong emphasis on exploring the full range of possible outcomes, including low-probability, high/consequence outcomes. Fourth, explaining climate change as a problem in managing risks links climate change to a wide range of sophisticated risk management tools and strategies that underpin much of modern society. Fifth, the concept of climate change as a challenge in managing risks helps cement the understanding that climate change is a threat multiplier, adding new dimensions and complexity to existing and emerging problems.\nFraming climate change as a challenge in managing risks creates an important but difficult agenda for research. The emphasis needs to shift from most likely outcomes to most risky outcomes, considering the full range of interacting processes, both in the climate system and in human responses. But conceptualizing the challenge of climate change as a challenge in managing risks also opens a path to a wide range of options for solutions. Together, the agenda for research and the options for solutions build toward Steve’s vision.",

The mantle gravity anomalies used in inversion are calculated by removing the crustal effects from the observed gravity. With constraints of thermal density model from seismic tomography, the integrative density structure is estimated from gravity inversion. Consequently, we obtain the compositional density by subtracting the thermal density from the integrative structure. The result of inversion shows the anisotropic composition of subduction zones, Cratons and plates boundary in Southeast Asia. In the shallow depth, the compositional density anomalies of large scales present uniform features in oceanic and continental mantle. In depth of 75-175 km, there are differences between the thermal and the compositional variations. The density anomalies at these depths are both affected by temperature and composition of the upper mantle. Below 175-km depth, the density anomalies are dominated by the compositional variations. Furthermore, comparing with high seismicity occurred at moderate-depth (50-300 km), we found that the compositional density variations is one of the factor that inducing earthquakes. The constrained inversion of mantle gravity anomaly has possibility to reveal the subduction which is not clearly seen from low-resolution tomography data, and may reveal the relation of seismicity and composition in the upper mantle.

The stage M1 is presented by assemblage of plagioclase + quartz + hornblende + porphyroblastic garnet core + rutile. P-T conditions for this stage cannot be quantitatively estimated. The stage M2 is represented by the porphyroblastic garnet rim with the matrix quartz, plagioclase, pyroxene, amphibole, rutile and ilmenite. P–T conditions for this stage are estimated to be 1.0–1.2 GPa and 700–750 °C. The stage M3 is shown by symplectitic coronas of hornblende + plagioclase ± ilmenite around the embayed M2 porphyroblastic garnets and yields P–T conditions of 0.6–0.7 GPa and 600–650 °C. The stage M4 is represented by small garnet rings immediately growing on the embayed M2 garnet or around the M2 pyroxene and hornblende, or by assemblage of fine-grain garnet + hornblende + sodium plagioclase growing from the M3 intergrowth of hornblende + Calcium plagioclase. The stage M5 is represented by albite, chlorite, epidote and actinolite growing in greenschist-facies conditions reasonably of 400–500 °C at relatively lower pressures. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating on the metamorphic zircon indicates that the M2 garnet porphyroblast and related assemblage and the M3 coronas grew at ca. 1.95 Ga; the M4 garnet growth occurred at ca. 1.82 Ga with reference to regional geochronological data. Both M2 and M4 garnets and related assemblages are indicative of medium P/T-type metamorphism. Qualitative and quantitative P–T estimates for stages M1, M2 and M3 define a clockwise P–T path. The resulting data suggest two late Paleoproterozoic collisional metamorphic events with important implication for amalgamation of the Quanji Massif with unknown continental blocks in NW China and close links to the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent.",

            "abstract": "There are multiple indications that wind circulation characteristics may have been changing over the last decades. However, obtaining a globally consistent high-accuracy assessment of these changes from spaceborne remote sensing data has proved elusive in many cases, even though ocean vector wind data has been collected from space starting in the 1990’s.\nThe reason that a consistent assessment of these changes is still a work in progress is due to multiple factors. Firstly, many of the scatterometer instruments were designed to meet accuracies satisfactory for weather prediction, not for the smaller magnitude changes associated with climate change. Nevertheless, these instruments have proven at least self-consistent over long periods and suggest that climate signals may be retrievable from their data.\nSecondly, the instruments have used different microwave frequency bands, and uncertainties still remain regarding the consistency of the measurement physics across frequency bands. Thirdly, the data have been processed differently with different, and potentially inconsistent, model functions. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, all of these satellites have been in sun-synchronous orbits, with observations being made at different local times. These differences in observation time leads to aliasing of diurnal and semi-diurnal observations into the climate data record.\nIn the first part of this talk, I review our current state of knowledge of the intercalibration of the three major scatterometers of the past decades: NASA’s QuikSCAT, EUMETSAT’s ASCAT (A & B), and ISRO’s OSCAT. In the second part, I describe the design of the NASA ISS-RapidScat cross-calibration mission. This mission uses the non-sun-synchronous characteristics of the International Space Station (ISS) orbit to provide coincident data with scatterometers in the constellation every revolution. It is expected that it will be able to provide cross-calibration cross section and wind data for QuikSCAT, ASCAT, and the forthcoming ISRO ScatSat mission. RapidScat is expected to launch in September, 2014, and the final part of this talk will present the first results of the mission on orbit.",

            "abstract": "Understanding post-seismic sediment transport is important for assessing crustal mass redistribution by earthquakes and for managing seismically-induced geohazards, including channel aggradation and flooding. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9) triggered over 60,000 landslides in the Longmen Shan range of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Records from hydrometric gauging show enhanced regional suspended sediment fluxes following the earthquake, resulting from evacuation of the landslide sediment (Wang et al., in revision). In addition to the insights into suspended sediment dynamics from gauging stations, this large-magnitude seismic event provides an opportunity to study bedload sediment transport after a large earthquake. Here we present primary results from a comprehensive investigation of the Min Jiang river system following the Wenchuan earthquake. Using a landslide inventory map (Li et al., 2014) and a DEM-based river network, we mapped landslide-river network connectivity. With photo-sieving techniques, we estimated the grain size distribution of medium-grained (mm to cm scale) landslide deposits. These data provide constraints on sediment sources. The mass of sediment in transport has been estimated from river sediment quartz 10Be measurements (West et al., 2014), supplemented here by constraints from rates of sediment infill in a downstream reservoir, determined by bathymetric profiling and analysis of sediment cores. Together with hydrometric data, this dataset provides the basic parameters for modeling sediment transport in the Min Jiang river system after the Wenchuan earthquake and promises insight into the mechanisms controlling post-earthquake sediment transport.\n",

Shear wave splitting of SK(K)S phases is often used as a common tool to evaluate upper mantle anisotropy. However, splitting of these phases can also constrain anisotropy in the lowermost mantle. SK(K)S phases have paths through lowermost mantle that are more vertical (incidence angles of ~30°–55°), potentially providing different sampling of D″ anisotropy and a different pattern of the anisotropic geometry than only using S, ScS, or Sdiff phases. Here we report observations of SKS–SKKS splitting measurements observed at10 stations (GSN network)in South America that sample D″ beneath Southeastern Pacific Ocean. About 10% of these show significantly different splitting between the two phases, which likely reflects a contribution from lowermost mantle anisotropy. Phases that have sampled the boundary of the Pacific large low shear velocity province (LLSVP) exhibit quite different splitting . Our results can be explained by deformation concentrations discrepancies of D″ region just outside the LLSVP boundary and its interior.",

            "abstract": "Recent seismic tomography studies indicate that some of the subducting slabs stagnate at the mantle transition zone. Subducting slabs generally comprise lithological layers of sediments, mid-ocean ridge basalt and peridotite. Some amount of water is believed to exist as hydrous minerals in sediments. Therefore, it is essential to understand the effect of hydrous minerals in sediments on global circulation of hydrogen in deep earth. Many hydrous minerals are not stable under the pressure-temperature conditions of the lower mantle. However, recent studies show that δ-AlOOH, which exists in a sediment layer of subducting slabs below 600 km depth, is stable up to the base of the lowermost mantle. This phase is a possible carrier and reservoir of water in cold slabs subducting into the deep mantle. We have conducted high pressure acoustic wave velocity measurements of δ-AlOOH using Brillouin spectroscopy and also we explored the chemical bonding of δ-AlOOH by Raman spectroscopy at high pressure in a diamond anvil cell up to 134 GPa. The result shows that δ-AlOOH becomes harder at pressures above 6 GPa due to the hydrogen bonding symmetrization and has a higher VS compared to those of the major minerals in the transition zone, such as wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and majorite. Therefore, the existence of δ-AlOOH phase might account for the positive Vs anomaly at 600 km depth beneath northwest Pacific subduction zone. In some stagnated slabs, VS at 600 km depth is 2 % faster than that of PREM. If sediments stagnate in the transition zone, the positive Vs anomaly at 600 km depth would be accounted for by the stagnated sediments containing δ-AlOOH in the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Segregation of residual melt from partially crystallized magmas is a process of paramount importance for the chemical evolution of magmas and the construction of reservoirs of potentially eruptible magma. In this study we investigate the Takidani pluton, one of the youngest exposed plutons on Earth (∼1Ma). This chemically zoned magmatic body is located within the active Norikura Volcanic Chain in the Northern Japan Alps and associated with large dacitic to rhyolitic deposits (Nyukawa Pyroclastic Flow Deposit and Ebisutoge-Fukuda tephra). Our study focuses on the physical processes responsible for the extraction of residual melt from a crystallizing magma and the construction of the subvolcanic reservoirs that fed large silicic eruptions. Detailed structural mapping and sampling along four transects from the base to the top of the pluton were carried out along with a magnetic susceptibility survey. Our preliminary results indicate that the pluton was assembled by multiple intrusions. The pluton can be broadly separated into three distinct lithological units: 1) fine grained granite; 2) equigranular granodiorite that locally grades into either porphyritic granodiorite or granite towards the roof of the intrusion; and 3) mafic granodiorite. Units 1) and 2) form the core of the intrusion and together represent about 70% of the total volume of the pluton. Our results show that the equigranular granodiorite is internally inhomogeneous with felsic lenses of lower magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic susceptibility decreases gradually towards the roof of the pluton reaching its lowest value within leucrocratic porphyritic units. Higher magnetic susceptibility values at the contact with the roof correspond to a slightly more mafic porphyritic unit. Melt segregation and evolution of the Takidani Granodiorite are being further investigated using bulk rock and mineral chemistry (EMPA and LA-ICP-MS) together with anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility.",

            "abstract": "Carbon is a key element for life. One of the most interesting forms of carbon is methane, as it is both consumed and produced by microorganisms. Methane has also several possible ways of abiotic origin, some of which could provide understanding of the origin of life itself. The study of methane is thus important in order to understand deep subsurface ecosystems such as those found in the 2516 m deep Outokumpu Deep Drill Hole within the Precambrian Fennoscandian Shield in eastern Finland. There rock types differ from graphite-bearing mica schist and black schist to serpentinite and pegmatitic granodiorite and saline, gas-rich water, with up to 32 mmol l-1 of methane, and residence times of tens of millions of years occupies the fracture zones which host diverse microbial life, including methanogenic archaea. In order to understand methane systematics in crystalline bedrock, we analysed several forms of carbon, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane and ethane from the Outokumpu Deep Drill Hole for their isotopic composition. In addition, isotopic compositions of water and hydrogen were determined. The results show that hydrogen is in isotopic equilibrium in the system H2O-H2-CH4 at ambient temperatures, which could either indicate equilibration due to long residence time or relatively recent production of methane in situ. Therefore hydrogen is not a very useful indicator for the origin of methane in this case. Carbon isotope analysis shows that both methane and DIC becomes generally more enriched in 13C with depth, which could indicate higher amounts of microbial methane in the upper part of the bedrock. Based on carbon isotope composition, two types of ethane can be discerned. Taken all the evidence together, this leads us to suggest that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the methane production in Outokumpu: 1) Biotic which comprise most of methane and 2) abiotic which dominates in the deeper parts of the bedrock. The former type may include both thermogenic and microbial methane as evidenced by the presence of graphitic rocks and methanogens, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this PhD thesis is to assess the influence of inherited structures and heterogeneities on the architecture and tectonic evolution of hyper-extended rift systems, with special focus on the North Atlantic. We propose a new mapping approach using simple and robust observation-based criteria to identify key features of rift systems, namely: 1) structural elements of rift domains; 2) age of the major rift events; and 3) key structures and heterogeneities inherited from previous orogenic phases.\nWe distinguish between 3 major rift domains: 1) the not or barely thinned proximal domain; 2) the unequivocal oceanic domain characterized by steady-state seafloor spreading; and, between them 3) the hyper-extended domain concentrating most of the deformation using gravity, magnetic and reflection and refraction seismic data. Previous studies mapped these domains along the magma-poor Iberia-Newfoundland and Bay of Biscay. One objective of this PhD is to extend this mapping further to the North, along the Irish, Scottish and Norwegian margins, into domains with polyphase rifting and magmatic additions.\nIn addition, we assign an age to the two most important events in the development of rifted margins, namely the necking and the breakup. This approach requires us to determine how these two events are recorded in the stratigraphy and how they can be mapped in seismic sections.\nIn order to highlight potential links between both rift domain architecture and timing of rifting and orogenic inheritance we map the structures and heterogeneities inherited from previous collision events that may have influenced significantly subsequent rifting. We consider features that: 1) are important enough to have had a potential impact on subsequent deformation; 2) are preserved through time; and 3) bear the potential to be reactivated.\nBased on these data, we try to link the architecture and evolution of the North Atlantic rift system with the nature and in-depth location of weak features initially present within the lithosphere in the light of minimal numerical modelling experiments and use these results as a basis for designing more comprehensive numerical models for the North Atlantic rifting.",

However, subsequent models explore the possibility that dissipation due to elevated temperatures alone can explain the observed dissipation factor (Q) and tidal love numbers. We have explored the hypothesis that high titanium melt compositions associated with lunar mantle overturn may sink to the base of the mantle, locally or regionally. We have performed forward calculations varying composition and thickness of layers to evaluate if a partially molten layer at the base of the mantle is well constrained by the observational data. Self-consistent physical parameters are calculated for each compositional model that are then compared against the observed data to determine a subset of permissible models. The data constraints considered by this study include bulk density, moment of inertia, real and imaginary parts of the Love numbers, seismic travel times, and electrical conductivity. Dynamic calculations using ASPECT have also been considered to determine the implications of early lunar mantle convection for the survivability of the partially molten layer. Finally, and as a perspective for a future NASA New Frontiers Geophysical Network, we present 1D synthetic seismograms calculated for each proposed structure of the Moon to investigate the future seismological resolution of these deep lunar structure features.

            "abstract": "Deep mantle and tectonic processes coupled with surface processes are both held responsible for the formation of the Andes and its adjacent foreland basins. These megascale processes on the western margin of South America directly influenced climate, drainages patterns and biodiversity across the continent and reached into the Atlantic Ocean. Here we highlight the most recent models that explain the relation between mantle and lithospheric processes with the geological, paleontological, and biodiversity records both in continental Amazonia and its marine extent, the Amazon deep-sea fan. New evidence on the geochemical signature of Neogene deposits in Amazonia, underpins increased influence of the Andes on drainage patterns from the Middle Miocene onwards. Furthermore, new records from the Amazon deep-sea fan illustrate the transcontinental effect of mountain building and climate change on sedimentation patterns and marine environmental changes in the Atlantic Ocean from the Late Miocene onwards. The case of the Andes-Amazonian sedimentary and biological system serves as a good example for similar tectono-sedimentary systems around the world and can encourage scientists from both geological and biological communities towards integrated research.",

            "abstract": "The Philippine Sea (PHS) plate is subducting beneath Kyusyu and a clear volcanic front is formed through the middle of the arc. However, there is a volcanic gap in the central part of Kyushu, between Aso and Kirishima volcanoes. Many studies have discussed arc magmatism in Kyushu in terms of 3D seismic velocity structure, but little is known on seismic attenuation structure. Seismic attenuation structure provides additional insights into subduction-zone dynamics, because higher-temperature environments or the existence of fluids may have different effects on seismic attenuation from on seismic velocity. Therefore the estimate of seismic attenuation is very important to understand arc magmatism and mantle dynamics in subduction zone. This study estimates seismic attenuation structure beneath Kyushu using a large number of high-quality waveform data.\nWe applied the method of Nakajima et al. (2013, JGR) to waveform data derived from 3052 earthquakes that occurred from April 2003 to May 2014. We determined the corner frequency of earthquakes by the spectral ratio method of S-coda waves. Then, we determined a whole-path attenuation term (t*), site-amplification factors and spectrum level simultaneously by a joint inversion. Finally, the t* values (N= 62290) were inverted to obtain three-dimensional attenuation structure.\nThe obtained results show several interesting features. First, the subducting PHS slab is imaged as a low attenuation zone. Second, high-attenuation zone exists in the fore-arc mantle. This high-attenuation zone corresponds spatially to a high Poisson’s ratio area, suggesting that the mantle is serpentinized as a result of fluids released by dehydration in the subducting crust. Third, an inclined high-attenuation zone that is interpreted as a mantle upwelling flow is observed in the back-arc mantle. However, the inclined high-attenuation zone is less developed in the volcanic gap between Aso and Kirishima volcanoes. This observation suggests the important role of mantle-wedge processes in the genesis of arc magmas.",

Among the instruments deployed on the spacecraft a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer can be found. This instrument is part of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium and allows us to study the magnetic properties of the plasma interaction at the comet. This interaction will be weak in the first months after the arrival because the expected gas production rate is several magnitudes lower than active comets close to their perihelion. In this paper we will present some of the magnetic field measurements in this unique environment and compare them with the latest hybrid plasma simulations, which predict the presence of a Mach cone, a deflection of the solar wind depending on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field, and the presence of waves for the early escort phase of the mission.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial biomarkers such as n-alkanes and cholesterol were analyzed to infer the variations of paleoproductivity and the corresponding paleoclimatologic information from the sediment of the Korean Plateau, East Sea (Japan Sea) since the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (ca. 400 ka). Previous studies of SST variation have shown that glacial-interglacial scale changes were quite variable with the maximum range of 26oC in MIS 7, and the minimum range of 12oC during MIS 2 and 6. The distribution of terrestrial n-alkanes signatures is characterized by the occurrence of high odd number frequency with a minor contribution of specific compound (nC27 only). Average Chain Length (ACL) and Carbon Preferences Index (CPI), both of which are derived from n-alkane combination, show similar shifting between glacial and interglacial periods. This suggests that paleovegetation communities had been changed in responding to paleoclimatological variations, and the input amount of terrestrial compound was strongly linked with paleoclimatologic changes. In particular, depleted values of δ13Corg during MIS 2, 8 and 10 were coincident with lower nitrogen isotope values indicating local paleoceanographic effects such as paleoproductivity changes. Decoupling between δ13Corg and δ15Norg during MIS 1, 3, 5, 7 and coupling of the two during MIS 8 and 11 can be observed, which appear to be interpreted as local productivity changes. In particular, high abundance of cholesterol and C21 n-alkanes, which were derived from diatom, increased during interglacial periods. Therefore, alkenones, SST and n-alkanes signatures coincide with δ13Corg and δ15Norg variations during glacial-interglacial cycles and further strongly associated with cholesterol abundance suggesting that the paleoenvironmental conditions in East Sea during glacial-interglacial periods were sensitive not only to global climate changes but also to local paleceanographic variations. Surface water circulation around the Korea Plateau associated with eustatic sea-level changes may have been linked with paleoproductivity changes, at least on the Korea Plateau of the East Sea (Japan Sea) since the last MIS 11.",

These exohiss waves are discovered in the wide MLT distribution [9.1,13.4] and low magnetic latitude, with narrow-band structure and weak intensity compared with plasmaspheric hiss. Using the Continue Waveform Burst Mode data and MAG data on the EMFISIS, we analyze the normal angle, electromagnetic planarity and anti~/parallel-propagating Poynting flux of exohiss wave. The results show indicate that exohiss waves are the result of plasmaspheric hiss leakage into the trough region. The dependence of the proportion of anti~/parallel-propagating Poynting flux on MLT can be explained by Landau damping associated with suprathermal eletrons.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic tomography (HT) is a sequential cross-hole hydraulic test followed by inversion of the data to map the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic properties (Yeh and Liu, 2000). We provide a focused, qualitative discussion on the hydraulic tomography data reported in Berg and Illman (2011). At the North Campus Research Site (NCRS) of the University of Waterloo, 8 pumping tests are conducted sequentially at different locations of the well field while drawdown is monitored at 44 ports distributed at 8 other wells. Without conducting inverse modeling, we discuss the behavior of the drawdown curves and the temporal evolution head field in response to pumping location, heterogeneity in aquifer parameters (i.e. hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (Ss)), flow regimes, and boundary conditions.\nWe emphasize the importance and direct benefits for conducting hydraulic tomography surveys relies primarily on the collection of non-redundant data, not on the inverse models. This paper attempts to use an intuitive/logical approach to qualitative hydraulic tomography analysis. Our interpretation on the aquifer heterogeneity largely agrees with the intensive core sampling (i.e. local K measurements) and inverse modeling results. We conclude some of the inspection procedures can be beneficial before the inversion of data, while the quantitative and unifying estimation of hydraulic parameter fields can only be done using an inverse model.",

Recognising the importance of regional expertise, GEBCO is collaborating with regional groups to help to continually improve its global model.\nThanks to the European initiative EMODnet (www.emodnet-hydrography.eu), data providers from more than 30 organisations are working to build a regional DTM at 1/8th arc-minute (~ 250 meters resolution) for European waters; from the Norwegian and Icelandic Seas, through the Baltic, Celtic and North Seas to the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea.\nWith the aim of producing harmonised products and to prevent any duplication of effort, GEBCO and EMODnet are working together to build an authoritative DTM for European waters. This consists of the following steps:\nThe Emodnet group has generated a Digital terrain model (2013 version) for European waters, with gaps between data sources.\nThe EMODnet (2013) DTM has been used to update GEBCO’s global grid using the remove-restore procedure involving the generation of a difference grid between the EMODnet 2013 and the initial GEBCO grids, which is then added on top of the initial GEBCO grid.\n  When compiling a new 2014 version of the EMODnet DTM, data gaps are filled with the new GEBCO grid.\nAs a result of this collaboration and the process described above, the latest (2014) versions of both grids show a marked improvement in their precision and continuity.\nRepeating this procedure for the future releases of EMODnet and GEBCO bathymetric grids will help improve knowledge of the bathymetry of European waters while providing a fit-for-purpose and consistent grid to users.",

            "abstract": "Long-term trends in total oxidants (Ox, defined as NO2 + O3) and ozone (O3) were analyzed based on the annual averages calculated from 56 air-quality stations (AQS) across Taiwan from 1994 to 2012. A simple regression of the annual averages for the period from 1994-2012 revealed an increasing trend for O3 (+0.51 ppbv/yr) and relatively constant levels of Ox at approximately 46 ppbv. However, when divided into two time periods, the O3 trend leveled off and remained constant at approximately 29 ppbv from 2007 to 2012, whereas the Ox level drastically decreased (-0.66 ppbv/yr) during this same period. These recent changes in the O3 and Ox trends island-wide were consistent with the trends observed in the largest metropolis, Taipei, suggesting a ubiquitous phenomenon. The changes in the O3 and Ox trends around 2007 can be attributed to two causes from the observation point of view. As for the sink perspective, NOx levels have continued to decrease rapidly since 1994 (-0.82 ppbv/yr or -44% over 19 years), diminishing the NO-titration and, thus, increasing O3 levels, resulting in constant Ox levels for the period prior to 2007. From the source perspective, continuous decreases in the levels of reducing agents (Non-methane hydrocarbons, NMHC: -0.012 ppmC/yr or -53% over 19 years, CO: -0.022 ppm/yr or -49% over 19 years) have lowered the photochemical O3 levels in recent years, resulting in altered O3 and Ox levels after 2007. The oceanic baseline O3 averages revealed by AQS on the satellite islands around Taiwan also indicated consistent results in recent years, with O3 values notably lower (38-40 ppbv) than the peak values of 40-45 ppbv in the early 2000s.",

The mission’s science objectives focus on the acceleration mechanism and the origin of outflow ions and other related outstanding scientific questions. The mission plans a constellation composed of four satellites orbiting the earth at three different altitudes. The proposed payloads include particles detectors, field detectors, aurora and neutral imaging system. These payloads will measure the plasma compositions and the electromagnetic waves, therefore determine the key acceleration mechanisms for the oxygen ions. This mission is selected as a background model supported by the strategy pioneer program of Chinese Academy of Science. The proposed lunch date is between 2019 to 2020.",

            "abstract": "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is widely applied to qualitative and quantitative interpretation of near-surface targets. Surface deployments of GPR most widely characterise physical properties in terms of some measure of GPR wavelet velocity. Wavelet amplitude is less-often considered, potentially due to difficulties in measuring this quantity: amplitudes are distorted by the anisotropic radiation pattern of antennas, and the ringy GPR wavelet can make successive events difficult to isolate. However, amplitude loss attributes could provide a useful means of estimating the physical properties of a target.\nGPR energy loss is described by the bandwidth-limited quality factor Q* which, for low-loss media, is proportional to the ratio of dielectric permittivity, ε, and electrical conductivity, σ. Comparing the frequency content of two arrivals yields an estimate of interval Q*, but only if they are sufficiently distinct. There may be sufficient separation between a primary reflection and its long-path multiple (i.e. a ‘repeat path' of the primary reflection) therefore a dataset that is rich in multiples may be suitable for robust Q* analysis. The Q* between a primary and multiple arrival describes all frequency-dependent loss mechanisms in the interval between the free-surface and the multiple-generating horizon: assuming that all reflectivity is frequency-independent, Q* can be used to estimate ε and/or σ.\nWe measure Q* according to the spectral ratio method, for synthetic and real GPR datasets. Our simulations are performed using the finite-difference algorithm GprMax, and represent our example data of GPR acquisitions over peat bogs. These data are a series of 100 MHz GPR acquisitions over sites in the Brecon Beacons National Park of South Wales. The base of the bogs (the basal peat/mineral soil contact) is often a strong multiple-generating horizon. As an example, data from Waun Ddu bog show these events lagging by ~75 ns: GPR velocity is measured here at 0.034 m/ns (relative ε of 77.9) and spectral ratios suggest Q* of 19.9 [-6.6 +19.4]. This Q* implies that the bulk σ of the bog is 21.7 [-10.7 +10.8] mS/m. Our measurements require in situ verification (e.g. comparison with co-located electrical resistivity profiles) but our method provides a promising addition to the suite of GPR analysis tools.",

            "abstract": "The Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) provides consistent gridded anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, precursor gases and aerosols from 1970 to 2010. Since EDGAR’s first release in 1996 (EDGARv2), a continuous improvement and upgrade of the emission data resulted in a sequence of releases. Here we present EDGAR_v4.3 (2014), which features new information on emission factors and an extension to 2009-2010 data compared to EDGAR_v4.2. EDGAR_v4.2 was used in many inverse modeling studies in EU, US, Africa and Asia yielding regional refinement of emission factors and adjustments of technology penetration (e.g. coal mining, power plants) and proxy data for geospatial distribution (e.g. passenger car transport). We focus on SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC emissions for the most recent year (2010), and compare them to two global inventories used in global modeling, as well as the regional inventories included in them. HTAP_v2 is a harmonized, global, gridded, emission database for 2010, developed for global and regional model tasks within the Task Force Hemispheric Transport Air pollution. It uses officially reported, gridded national inventories, complemented with science based data, partly gap-filled with EDGAR. However, since HTAP_v2 is relying on (sub-)national statistics, it may not be as consistent across countries and regions, as a globally calculated inventory using international statistics and global geospatial distributions. Another available global inventory is MACCity, covering the years 1980-2010. We compare EDGAR_v4.3 with HTAP_v2 and MACCity in order to explain differences from national estimates and address emission inventory uncertainties, indicating weaknesses and strengths of these databases. We present the geospatial distribution of emissions at 0.1x0.1 degree resolution, comparing the contribution of developing and emerging countries with industrialized regions, both as absolute and per capita data.",

            "abstract": "T-waves are seismic energies that have at least partially propagated through a water body. Such waves can propagate long distances and are thus useful for studying small events. However, factors controlling the amplitude and duration of T-waves remain unclear. In this study, we obtained data by using a broadband ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) that recorded T-waves produced by 60 Mw>3.3 earthquakes that occurred in Taiwan. In addition, we used T-waves produced by 90% of these events recorded at an island station. For each earthquake, we forward-calculated the travel times of the P- and S-waves converted to T-wave, and correlated them with different paths from the earthquake. The duration of the observed T-wave fits with the paths from the available conversion points in the regional bathymetry. The waveform gaps were correlated with the gaps of the bathymetry contour lines. However, the arrival times of abyssal earthquakes show that parts of the T-waves converted directly from the deep seafloor near the sources. We calculated the synthetic ground motions at the conversion points along the 1000-m bathymetric contour lines. We then calculated the synthetic T-wave amplitude at those conversion points. Using these results, we calculated the T-wave amplitude envelopes and determined that they fit the observed OBS data. Furthermore, we used the ratio of ground motions to water pressure change to determine whether the T-wave arrives at the OBS as ground motions or as acoustic waves from the water column. This method can help determine the different paths and amplitudes of the T-waves recorded using OBSs.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis of the earthquake cycle is a key issue for the definition of the hazard in seismic areas. Advanced SAR Interferometry (A-InSAR) techniques have today a key role in Earth Sciences thanks to the capability to detect and measure slow surface movements along wide areas, and to follow the evolution of signal along a certain time periods. A-InSAR techniques have been applied to large datasets of SAR images spanning long time intervals and, together with in-situ surveys and ground measurements, can provide suitable information about the causes of post seismic (deformation rebound or residual strain release) and interseismic (seismic, creep) movements. In the framework of FP7 MARSITE (Marmara Supersite) project we have investigated the Western sector of North Anatolian Fault System (NAFS) from Istanbul toward Duzce area. From West toward the Marmara Sea region (Mudurnu/Akyaz) the NAFS begins to lose its single fault line character and splays into a complex fault system. The main Marmara Fault is argued to be a very young structure and exhibits typical characteristics of a major strike slip fault. In 1999 the August 17th Izmit earthquake was followed few months later by the Duzce mainshock. We compare the A-InSAR results to permanent GPS stations installed in the region after the Izmit/Duzce earthquakes. These observations allow studying the post-seismic deformation of the 1999 Izmit/Düzce earthquake. We investigate the response of the eastern Marmara Fault to the quasi-static loading caused by Izmit/Düzce earthquakes. Overlapped post-seismic processes of fault creep (or afterslip) and viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust and the upper mantle were investigated. We firstly estimated the viscoelastic relaxation effect using well covered long-term GPS data. This relaxation effect was subtracted from the InSAR data and the remaining InSAR data was inverted to identify localized slip variation along the MMF. Our inversion results imply that part of the MMF segment is subject to aseismic fault movement. The fault movement might be triggered by the 1999 Izmit/Düzce earthquakes, and has partially released the strain accumulated on this segment, challenging previous interpretations on a possible rupture of this segment of the fault.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly acknowledged that there is a source for pickup ions in the inner heliosphere. These so-called inner-source pickup ions are most probably created from solar wind ions interacting with interplanetary dust particles, but a production scenario consistent with all observations has not been found to date. As the composition of inner-source pickup ions should depend on their production, a precise knowledge of this could help identifying the production mechanism. For this purpose the raw pulse-height analysis data from the Charge-Time-Of-Flight (CTOF) sensor of the Charge, ELement, and Isotope Analysis System (CELIAS) on board the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was reanalyzed. An in-flight calibration of the sensor was performed to identify heavy pickup ions by their mass-per-charge. The composition of inner-source heavy pickup ions was derived by a sophisticated statistical assignment of the counts. Finally, this composition was compared to an estimated composition one would expect from a production scenario involving solar wind ions passing through nm-sized dust grains and a good agreement was found. Due to the large geometry factor of CTOF it was also possible to investigate the abundance ratio of the two most prominent inner-source heavy pickup ions, C+ and O+, at different solar wind speeds. A systematic increase of the O+/C+ abundance ratio with higher solar wind speeds was found. This is likely to be a further signature of the production mechanism of inner-source pickup ions.",

            "abstract": "In 1975, DSDP Leg 42B to the Black Sea, three sites were drilled with a total of 2318 m cored and a recovery of 55%. While to modern standards this may not be very impressive, these sites still represent the best record of sedimentation in the basinal part of the Black Sea. The main stratigraphic objectives of DSDP Leg 42B were to 1) obtain a complete Pleistocene litho- and biostratigraphic section and 2) study interactions between the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea, focusing on glacio-eustatic sea level change, periods of lacustrine sedimentation, periods of stagnation, and to establish a paleoclimatic record. Major problems establishing a timescale emerged after drilling due to a) the general shortage of definitive paleontological age markers and b) the general lack of agreement on correlation and time zonation of sedimentary units.\nMagnetostratigraphic dating could have solved these timescale problems but was hindered by the presence of the little understood authigenic iron sulphide mineral greigite (Fe3S4) as main magnetic carrier. In recent years, the understanding of greigite has significantly improved and is considered a reliable magnetic carrier. Especially in the circum-Black Sea region, many Miocene to recent, land-based sections are magnetostratigraphically dated with greigite as magnetic carrier. We therefore resample the cores of DSDP Leg 42B to see whether after 40 years of storage any of the original signal is preserved.\nOur results show these cores are surprisingly useful for magnetostratigraphic dating. We create an integrated bio-magnetostratigraphic framework for the sites of Leg 42B, focusing on the Latest Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene. Ar/Ar dating of an ash-layer at site 380A gives additional age constraints. Our age model gives important new insights into the response of the Black Sea to major paleoenvironmental and climatic changes like e.g. the Messinian salinity crisis, the mid-Pliocene warm period and Pleistocene glaciations on the Northern Hemisphere.\nA future IODP expedition to the Black Sea is long overdue and important for paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental processes in central and eastern Europe and also for an array of geochemical studies. Given the chronological constraints are no longer problematic, a repeat of the confusion after the 1970’s expedition seems unlikely.",

            "abstract": "Coastal adaptation to sea-level rise (SLR) in the deltaic region is a multidimensional and complex process requiring informed decisions based on predicted impact and vulnerability assessment of SLR. Elevation plays a key role in determining the impact and vulnerability of coastal land areas to inundation from SLR. Highly accurate mapping of the elevation of the landscape is essential to identify low-lying coastal deltaic regions with valuable ecosystem like mangroves and its dependent human communities that are potentially at risk of inundation. It is difficult for policy planners and decision makers to identify suitable adaptation strategies without having information on the predicted impact and degree of vulnerability of coastal systems to SLR. Importantly, modeling and mapping will provide valuable input to climate change adaptation planning (NOAA 2010). Unfortunately, the comprehensive range of information that is typically required is seldom available and rarely in the possession of decision makers responsible for management of the deltaic and coastal zone (O’Regan, 1996).\nThe present study seeks to provide insights on predicted impact of climate change induced SLR on mangrove ecosystem and its dependent human communities of Pichavaram mangroves, located at the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine region on the banks of Cauvery delta, Tamil Nadu, India. Based on real-time on-ground elevation measurement by DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) survey and by using GIS portals, the study has identified about 597 ha of mangroves (one third of total mangrove regions) and about 9 fishing hamlets with 12,000 and more of human population that directly depends on this mangrove ecosystem for their livelihood are under threat of inundation to the predicted impact of 0.5m SLR. The present study is intended to showcase a method by providing reliable scientific information on predicted impact of SLR on mangroves and its dependent human communities to policy planner for informed decision making. Very importantly, this study has made an attempt to develop a robust picture of ecosystem based and community centered anticipatory adaptation strategies to the risk of rising sea level that are grounded in pressing community priorities of coastal regions of Cauvery delta.",

            "abstract": "The use of RDBMS for the storage and management of geo and space science data and/or metadata is very common. Although the information stored in tables is based on a data model and therefore well organized and structured, a direct mashup with RDF based data stored in triple stores is not possible. One solution of the problem consists in the transformation of the whole content into RDF structures and storage in triple stores. Another interesting way is the use of a specific system/service, such as e.g. D2RQ, for the access to relational database content as virtual, read only RDF graphs. The Semantic Web based -proof of concept- GFZ ISDC uses the triple store Virtuoso for the storage of general context information/metadata to geo and space science satellite and ground station data. There is information about projects, platforms, instruments, persons, product types, etc. available but no detailed metadata about the data granuals itself. Such important information, as e.g. start or end time or the detailed spatial coverage of a single measurement is stored in RDBMS tables of the ISDC catalog system only. In order to provide a seamless access to all available information about the granuals/data products a mashup of the different data resources (triple store and RDBMS) is necessary. This paper describes the use of D2RQ for a Semantic Web/SPARQL based mashup of relational databases used for ISDC data server but also for the access to IUGONET and/or ESPAS and further geo and space science data resources.\nRDBMS Relational Database Management System\nRDF Resource Description Framework\nSPARQL SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language\nD2RQ Accessing Relational Databases as Virtual RDF Graphs\nGFZ ISDC German Research Centre for Geosciences Information System and Data Center\nIUGONET Inter-university Upper Atmosphere Global Observation Network (Japanese project)\nESPAS Near earth space data infrastructure for e-science (European Union funded project)",

            "abstract": "Around the Boso Peninsula, Japan, slow slip events (SSEs) accompanying earthquake swarms recur with repeating intervals between two to seven years, associated with the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate (PHS) from the Sagami trough beneath the Kanto metropolitan area. These SSEs share an almost identical source area for each episode, which is adjacent to the source area of the Kanto megathrust earthquakes. Because both of the SSEs and the earthquakes are slip events on the same PHS plate interface, understandings on factors that control the recurrence behavior of the SSEs provides important information not only for the nature of the SSEs itself, but also about the slip property on the plate interface.\nThe latest event occurred in January 2014, i.e., it is the shortest interval of 27 months after the previous event in October 2011 (Ozawa, 2014) while the average recurrence interval is 61 months for over 30 years since 1983 (Hirose et al., 2012). Although the recurrence intervals could be modulated by stress changes caused by nearby large earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and its afterslip (Hirose et al., 2012), there is no such large earthquake or other phenomenon that can hasten the latest SSE, and thus other factors are required for the shortening of the interval.\nIn order to clarify factors that control the recurrence intervals, we estimated the source slip processes for the recent SSEs whose crustal deformations have been observed with tiltmeters and GNSS. The 2007 and 2011 SSEs have similar size in seismic moment (Hirose et al., 2014), while the 2014 SSE has a smaller seismic moment than the two previous SSEs. The maximum stress drop for the 2014 SSE is estimated as about 1/2 of those for the 2007 and 2011 SSEs. Although we can not specify mechanisms that hastened the occurrence of the latest SSE, this might suggest that the strength of the source area might have reduced and the slip event occurred at a lower stress level.",

            "abstract": "The Red River shear zone (RRSZ) is the most significant geologic discontinuity in Southeast Asia. The Day Nui Con Voi (DNCV) massif at the southernmost part of the shear zone bears records of Cenozoic RRSZ activity. The DNCV in northwestern Vietnam predominantly consists of HP granulite facies metapelites, and lenticular enclaves of HP mafic granulites, calc-silicate granulites and UHT aluminum-rich rocks in the metapelites.\nHP granulites are characterized by the key associations of garnet-kyanite-ternary feldspar (in metapelites) and garnet-clinopyroxene-plagioclase-quartz (in mafic granulites). In the latter case, rocks are typically orthopyroxene-free. The peak assemblage of the HP metapelites includes garnet + kyanite + ternary feldspar + quartz + rutile. The peak assemblage of the HP mafic granulites is garnet + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + quartz. Meanwhile, the peak assemblage of the calc-silicate granulites is high-Ca garnet (Grs>50) + diopside + scapolite + quartz. On the other hand, characteristic UHT metamorphic assemblage occur as the coexistence of spinel and quartz which indicates the metamorphic temperature is higher than 900℃. The peak assemblage of the UHT rocks in DNCV is corundum + spinel + garnet + sillimanite + quartz.\nP-T conditions of peak metamorphism within HP granulite facies are: T = 750～850℃, P = 12.5～14kbar. The temperature of UHT metamorphism is higher than 900℃, the pressure is higher than 9～9.4 kbar.\nSHRIMP U-Pb dating of zircons from the HP mafic granulites and UHT rocks gave minimum ages of ca. 59 Ma and 40 Ma, respectively. HP metapelites gave ca. 60~50Ma and 30Ma. The above facts suggest the DNCV massif experienced HP granulite facies at its peak metamorphism at ∼59 Ma. Thermal disturbance on the local scale to UHT metamorphism occurred at ∼40 Ma. Then isothermal decompression to medium-pressure granulite facies occurred at ∼30Ma, which may reflect a rapid exhumation.\nThe HP rocks are interpreted to be resulted from crustal thickening due to far-field compression during Indian-Eurasian convergence. However the high heat flow for UHT metamorphism was possibly attributed to upwelling of asthenosphere triggered by delamination of the thickened crust. The delamination may also be responsible for subsequent generation of high potassic magmas along the RRSZ belt.",

            "abstract": "The convecting mantle represents Earth’s largest reservoir for volatile storage on geological timescales. Continuous outgassing in volcanic settings worldwide indicates that volatile recycling during subduction of oceanic crust is critical for the maintenance of mantle volatile contents. Subducting basaltic crust initially contains a cocktail of volatiles, but it loses effectively its entire water cargo as hydrous fluids between 70 and 300 km depending on slab temperature [1], which may leave a residual anhydrous carbonated MORB assemblage. The fate of this carbon during subduction to greater depths is important geologically due to its potential role in causing mantle melting and metasomatism. Large discrepancies exist among studies of carbonated eclogite, and results are scarce beyond 10 GPa. Here we present results of experiments on MORB containing 2.5 wt.% CO2between 3 and 21 GPa.\nWe observe a subsolidus phase assemblage dominated by garnet, clinopyroxene and SiO2 at all pressures. At pressures lower than 7 GPa CO2 is the stable carbon phase in all runs due to the reaction dol + 2coes = cpx + CO2 [2]. Solid dolomite, magnesite and/or Na2(Ca,Mg,Fe)4(CO3)5 are observed in subsolidus experiments at higher pressure. Near-solidus melts above 7 GPa are carbonatites, with Ca# > 0.5 and alkali contents that increase with pressure. The solidus temperature of 1200 °C at 3 GPa rises to 1375 °C at 13 GPa. At higher pressure the melting temperature drops sharply by > 200 °C to ~ 1150 °C. This creates a ledge in the solidus at 13 – 15 GPa, just above or within the uppermost transition zone, which coincides with the appearance of Na2(Ca,Mg,Fe)4(CO3)5. Temperature paths for the majority of worldwide slabs [3] intersect this ledge and produce carbonatite melt that will metasomatise the overlying mantle, potentially causing a region of increased diamond formation. Only material in the coldest slabs will pass beneath the ledge and carry carbon deeper into the Earth. Thus, this ledge may act as a carbon filter for downgoing slabs, and might be responsible for some low velocity anomalies seen above the 410 km seismic discontinuity.\n[1] Maruyama & Okamoto (2007) Gond Res 11, 148-165.

            "abstract": "Six years of high resolution pCO2, water quality, and meteorological data were used to calculate air-sea CO2 fluxes on yearly, seasonal and monthly timescales, and relate the temporal and spatial variation in CO2 fluxes to meteorological events and land derived inputs.\nThree MAPCO2 buoys are deployed in coastal waters of Oahu as part of the NOAA/PMEL Carbon Program, that autonomously collects CO2 and water quality data at 3-hour intervals. The buoys are located on a backreef in Kaneohe Bay and two fringing reef sites on Oahu's south shore, the latter two in open ocean like conditions but with one also influenced by fluvial inputs.\nData for this study were collected from June 2008 to July 2014. Mean pCO2 values at the Ala Wai, Kilo Nalu and CRIMP2 buoys were 396, 381 and 447µatm, respectively, with mean daily ranges of 51, 32 and 190 µatm, respectively. The daily range in pCO2 is largest at CRIMP2, reflecting a combination of higher primary production and respiration, vigorous calcification and longer water residence time within the barrier reef environment.\nNet annualized air-sea CO2 fluxes of the entire study period were 0.083, -0.014 and 1.167 mol C m-2 year-1 for Ala Wai, Kilo Nalu and CRIMP2, respectively. Positive values indicate a CO2 flux from the water to the atmosphere (source behavior), and negative values from the atmosphere to the water (sink behavior).\nThis presentation will also discuss the effects physical and biogeochemical processes on the magnitude and variability of air-sea CO2 fluxes. We observe a negative correlation between CO2 flux and rainfall over monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales. This correlation however, can partly be explained by temperature, because increased rainfall is more common during the colder winter months. Nevertheless, rainfall affects CO2 fluxes, both by rain-induced nutrient and organic matter runoff, as well as the physical effect of raindrops on air-sea gas exchange and the dilution of the air-sea boundary layer. We report that air-sea CO2 fluxes are highly variable on short time scales, and that Kilo Nalu and Ala Wai are weak sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, although after rainstorms and certain months in the winter season, the flux direction can reverse they become weak sinks for CO2.",

            "abstract": "Since the first cGPS have been installed in 1997 in the Guerrero-Oaxaca region of the Central American subduction zone in Mexico, several slow slip events (SSE) have been observed there. Further studies showed that the SSE characteristics are disparate in Guerrero and Oaxaca in terms of duration, amplitude and depth. In particular, recent investigations show that the slip during SSE intrudes the seismogenic zone in Guerrero, but barely in Oaxaca. The SSE lateral and depth extent has important implications on the seismic cycle. It affects the redistribution of stress (increasing or decreasing it) within the seismogenic zone, thus the timing and magnitude of future earthquakes.  It is thus important to constrain a degree of coupling on the subduction interface and how the coupling evolves in space and time. This can be achieved by refining coupling models based on the observations and exploring a sensitivity of the models to variations of their main parameters.\nTo better understand the effect of the SSE on the seismic cycle along the Mexican subduction zone, we analyze cGPS data and invert the time series, using a method based on a principal component analysis: PCAIM (Principal Component Analysis-based Inversion Method). For both Guerrero and Oaxaca areas, we first discuss the geometry of the plates’ interface. Then we investigate in particular the effect of possible lateral and down-dip variations of the subduction interface on coupling models. Subsequent modeling using the PCAIM of the sequential SSEs that occurred in the past decade permitted to compare our results with the inferences of previously published works. We present the first analysis of the latest large SSE that started in January 2014 in Guerrero. We show that the PCAIM allows to describe a complex slip history in space and time of different SSEs and to provide a comparative analysis of behavior of the individual SSEs. We then discuss the potential interplay between SSE in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and the link between them and seismicity. Finally, we interpret our coupling map in terms of slip budget and seismic hazard in Guerrero and Oaxaca areas.",

            "abstract": "Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios of volcanic materials on a planet reflect oxidation of the magma source region and the additional effects of magma interaction with the near surface environment. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) enables measurement of Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in situ at micro-scales on standard thin sections. Because melt composition and structure affect Fe3+/ΣFe, XAS measurements of unknowns require calibration standards with like compositions. To address this need, a suite of 33 synthetic glass standards covering a wide range of geologically-relevant compositions was generated under four varying fO2conditions.\nRuns were conducted in a 1-atm gas mixing furnace using the Pt (fO2 ≥ QFM) or Re (fO2 < QFM) wire-loop technique. Air, MH (CO2), QFM, and IW were used to equilibrate each composition, with fO2 values fixed by gas mixing or use of a solid buffer. Samples were then prepared for Mössbauer and XAS analyses, with Fe2+/Fe3+values from the former used to calibrate the latter using a multivariate model. XAS data were acquired both at NSLS beamline x26a and at the GSECARS beamline (13-ID) at APS.\nOver the compositional range from andesite (7.1-11.8 wt.% FeO and 53.6-55.9 wt. SiO2) to basaltic andesite (4.6-7.9 wt.% FeO and 58.8-62.4 wt. SiO2) to basalt (6.8-11.0 wt.% FeO and 47.9-50.7 wt. SiO2), Fe3+ contents of glasses equilibrated at each buffer are comparable, as expected. Those samples equilibrated in air are ~89±2% Fe3+, in CO2, ~77±3 Fe3+, and in QFM and IW, ~11±4% Fe3+. Predictive models (e.g., Kilinc et al., 1983) suggest that the increased SiO2 concentrations in dacites and rhyolites result in increased Fe3+ at higher fO2s (Figure 1). Our data support this prediction; e.g., dacites with 67.1-71.6 wt.% SiO2 at IW are 20±10%Fe3+. Once synthesized and characterized, these equilibrated glasses will form the basis for multivariate analysis of XAS spectra that will provide a broad calibration for measuring Fe3+ in silicate glasses at any synchrotron facility.",

In this work, effects of magnetic field configuration on the day-night asymmetry of chorus occurrence rate are investigated using a recently developed hybrid code DAWN. Previous observations demonstrate that dayside chorus occur in regions where background magnetic field is almost homogeneous, suggesting that the magnetic field configuration might play a significant role in the dayside chorus excitation. Using the DAWN code, we numerically study the threshold conditions of hot electron distributions to excite chorus waves with different magnetic field configurations. Our results demonstrate that in a magnetic field with smaller inhomogeneity, smaller temperature anisotropy and hot electron density are needed to excite chorus waves. This conclusion could help understand the higher occurrence rate of chorus waves on the dayside compared with that on the nightside especially during quiet times.",

A set of small, sharply defined magnetic anomalies extends southward from this line of bathymetric highs to the islands Kume-jima and Aguni-jima, suggesting the former existence of an ancient volcanic front. The ages of volcanic rocks from these islands indicate that magmatic activity along the ancient volcanic front continued until at least ~2.1 Ma.

            "abstract": "Increasing temperatures are projected to have a positive effect on the length of Alaska’s tourism season, but the natural attractions that tourism relies on, such as glaciers, wildlife, fish, or other natural resources, may change. In order to continue to derive benefits from these resources, nature-based tour operators may have to adapt to these changes, and communication is an essential, but poorly understood, component of the climate change adaptation process. The goal of this study was to determine how to provide useful climate change information to nature-based tour operators by answering the following questions: 1. What environmental changes do nature-based tour operators perceive? 2. How are nature-based tour operators responding to climate and environmental change? 3. What climate change information do nature-based tour operators need? To answer these questions, twenty-four nature-based tour operators representing 20 different small and medium sized businesses in Juneau, Alaska were interviewed. The results show that many of Juneau’s nature-based tour operators are observing, responding to, and in some cases, actively planning for further changes in the environment. The types of responses tended to vary depending on the participants’ certainty in climate change and the perceived risks to their organization. Using these two factors, this study proposes a framework to classify climate change responses for the purpose of generating meaningful information and communication processes that promote adaptation and build adaptive capacity. During the course of the study, several other valuable lessons were learned about communicating about adaptation. The results of this study demonstrate that science communication research has an important place in the practice of promoting and fostering climate change adaptation. While the focus of this study was tour operators, the lessons learned may be valuable to other organizations striving to engage unique groups in climate change adaptation planning efforts and to social scientists trying to understanding of the role of communication in climate change adaptation.",

            "abstract": "Gravity waves (GWs) and solar tides (STs) are major components of the mesosphere-lower-thermosphere (MLT) dynamics. GWs are short scale free waves while STs are global scale and thermally driven. Mostly exited in the lower atmosphere and propagating upward, GWs and STs form the main constituents of the dynamical coupling between troposphere and MLT.\nGWs and STs incorporate a huge range of scale, from small to global. But conventional GWs parameterizations used to describe this interaction neglect time-dependence and horizontal gradients of the background flow, with potentially fatal effects. We here consider a step-by-step approach to study the GWs and diurnal STs interaction.\nGWs propagate in a time-dependent background flow, modeled by a new WKB GW model (ray tracer scheme) where the crossing of rays (caustic problem) is prevented. Climatological mean (which include stationary planetary waves) and diurnal tidal fields extracted initially from a general circulation model (HAMMONIA) compose the background flow. The deposition of momentum and buoyancy from the GWs propagation is calculated. The evaluated Rayleigh-friction and temperature-relaxation coefficients impose in turn a GW forcing on the propagation of diurnal STs in a climatological mean background flow. The propagation of STs is described in a linear version of a general circulation model (KMCM), allowing for planetary waves in the background state. The extracted STs are then used for a new computation of the GW fluxes. This is iterated a few times to obtain a converged result on GW fluxes and STs.\nA simplified GWs ensemble is considered, homogenously launched in all directions, at a single launch level. STs are projected onto their migrating and non-migrating components DS0, DE[1,2,3] and DW[1,2,3]. The temporal dependence of the background flow leads to a modulation of the GWs momentum deposition. Due to constructive and destructive interferences, planeraty waves play an active role in the modulation of the GW fluxes but they also influence the DS0 and DW[1,2] amplitudes. Because transient critical layers disappear, the horizontal and temporal dependence of the background flow reduce the amplitude of GW momentum and entropy. In concequence, the amplitude of the STs is also reduced. The seasonal variability of the GWs-STs interaction is studied as well.",

Evidence suggests that much of this error is linked to Short Wave (SW) radiation, sensible and latent heat biases. Flaws in the representation of clouds and a deficit of supercooled liquid water in mixed-phase clouds are suspected as a likely source of the SW error.\nA physically based method that uses subgrid turbulence to control a new liquid production term has been developed. Comparisons between theory, based on a stochastic differential equation used to represent supersaturation fluctuations, and decametre resolution Large Eddy Simulations will be presented. An implementation of this approach in a GCM shows an increased prevalance of supercooled liquid water and a reduction in the magnitude of the Southern Ocean SW bias.\nTo conclude, we will summarize the complete package of changes that have been made to tackle the Southern Ocean SST bias in a physically meaningful way.",

            "abstract": "Multiphysics modelling has become an indispensable tool for geoscientists to simulate the complex behaviours observed in their various fields of study where multiple processes are involved, including thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical (THMC) laws. This modelling activity involves simulations that are computationally expensive and its soaring uptake is tightly linked to the increasing availability of supercomputing power and easy access to powerful nonlinear solvers such as PETSc (\nhttp://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/\n). The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is a finite-element, multiphysics framework (\nhttp://mooseframework.org\n) that can harness such computational power and allow scientists to develop easily some tightly-coupled fully implicit multiphysics simulations that run automatically in parallel on large clusters. This open-source framework provides a powerful tool to collaborate on numerical modelling activities and we are contributing to its development with REDBACK (\nhttps://github.com/pou036/redback\n), a module for Rock mEchanics with Dissipative feedBACKs.\nREDBACK builds on the tensor mechanics finite strain implementation available in MOOSE to provide a THMC simulator where the energetic formulation highlights the importance of all dissipative terms in the coupled system of equations. We show first applications of fully coupled dehydration reactions triggering episodic fluid transfer through shear zones (Alevizos et al, 2014). The dimensionless approach used allows focusing on the critical underlying variables which are driving the resulting behaviours observed and this tool is specifically designed to study material instabilities underpinning geological features like faulting, folding, boudinage, shearing, fracturing, etc. REDBACK provides a collaborative and educational tool which captures the physical and mathematical understanding of such material instabilities and provides an easy way to apply this knowledge to realistic scenarios, where the size and complexity of the geometries considered, along with the material parameters distributions, add as many sources of different instabilities.\n",

            "abstract": "The European Plate Observing System (EPOS) is an ambitious long term integration plan addressing the major solid-earth research infrastructures in Europe. For its large scale and extent it is a unique initiative which will foster new scientific discoveries and enable scientists to investigate the solid earth system in unprecedented ways. A key aspect of EPOS is to provide end-users with homogeneous access to services and multidisciplinary data collected by monitoring infrastructures and experimental facilities as well as access to processing and visualization tools. Such a complex system requires a solid, scalable and reliable architecture in order to accommodate innovative features and to meet the evolving expectations of the heterogeneous communities involved. Within the FP7 EU project EPOS PP\n1 (Preparatory Phase), which is approaching its completion in October 2014, the goal of the infrastructure and virtual community working group (WG7) was to design and test a preliminary architecture. The EPOS e-infrastructure architecture has been systematically developed based on collected primary (user) and secondary (interoperation with other systems) requirements and through three distinct design refinement phases (Strawman, Woodman and Ironman). The EPOS architecture is constituted of Integrated Core Services (ICS), which provide access to thematic (domain-specific) services (Thematic Core Services - TCS) integrating national research infrastructures. The key component of the architecture is the metadata catalogue, which utilizes the CERIF\n2(Common European Research Information Format) standard. The metadata catalogue is conceived to effectively capture all the information needed and to make large (re-)use of existing domain specific standards. In this contribution we will present the lessons learned and the technical achievements of the EPOS Preparatory Phase.\n1www.epos-eu.org\n2www.eurocris.org",

            "abstract": "The idea that hybridized mantle rocks can contribute to the oceanic crust composition has recently emerged thanks to studies on primitive (olivine-rich) troctolites [e.g. 1]. These rocks are considered to be formed by melt-rock interaction, but the exact reaction process by which they originate is still debated and their role on the bulk oceanic crust composition has been never defined. Olivine-rich troctolites have been mostly found at slow spreading ridges [2] or at their fossil analogues [3]. Similar rocks have been recently collected in the 25ºS area of the intermediate spreading Central Indian Ridge (CIR), and rarely characterize the crust mantle boundary at fast spreading ridges [4]. We show that textural and chemical inheritances of the pre-existing mantle are preserved in the CIR troctolites. In particular, the local occurrence of granular, mantle-derived orthopyroxenes and the composition of the associated clinopyroxene indicate that these crustal rocks formed through a direct (one-stage) conversion of a mantle peridotite. We use chemical evidence to infer the same origin of the olivine-rich troctolites worldwide, concluding that the reactive overprint of the oceanic mantle is a process diffused over the entire spreading rate spectrum. Bulk oceanic crust estimates of the Hess Deep (Pacific) and Atlantis Massif (Atlantic) crustal sections are used to quantify and compare the effect of these rocks on the bulk crust composition at fast and slow spreading ridges. Our inferences suggest that the significance of the bulk oceanic crust should be reassessed. When hybrid troctolites are included at crustal levels, the oceanic crust cannot be considered equal to the composition of the melt extracted from the mantle, but it results more primitive and importantly thicker.\n",

Shock--turbulence interaction is one of the most challenging problems in turbulence modeling. A strong variation of the mean density () leads to a strong density variance. The expressions for the turbulent correlations such as the Reynolds and turbulent Maxwell stresses, the turbulent electromotive force, etc. are examined in a compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. It is shown that in the presence of the density variance, a mean density gradient () oblique or perpendicular to the mean magnetic field gives rise to the turbulent electromotive force. Since the electric current density induced by this effect is in the direction of the reconnection electric current density, the turbulent energy near the slow shock in the fast magnetic reconnection is expected to be enhanced. The physical origin of this effect is discussed. A turbulence model incorporating this effect is proposed. This model is expected to reproduce the spatial distribution of the turbulent energy around the fast magnetic reconnection.",

            "abstract": "Despite the extreme complexity that characterizes earthquake generation process, simple phenomenology seems to apply in the collective properties of seismicity. The best known is the Gutenberg-Richter relation. Short and long-term clustering, power-law scaling and scale-invariance have been exhibited in the spatio-temporal evolution of seismicity providing evidence for earthquakes as a nonlinear dynamic process. Regarding the physics of “many” earthquakes and how this can be derived from first principles, one may wonder, how can the collective properties of a set formed by all earthquakes in a given region, be derived and how does the structure of seismicity depend on its elementary constituents – the earthquakes? What are these properties?\nThe physics of many earthquakes has to be studied with a different approach than the physics of one earthquake making the use of statistical physics necessary to understand the collective properties of earthquakes. Then a natural question arises. What type of statistical physics is appropriate to commonly describe effects from the microscale and crack opening level to the level of large earthquakes?\nAn answer to the previous question could be non-extensive statistical physics, introduced by Tsallis (1988), as the appropriate methodological tool to describe entities with (multi) fractal distributions of their elements and where long-range interactions or intermittency are important, as in fracturing phenomena and earthquakes. In the present work, we review some fundamental properties of earthquake physics and how these are derived by means of non-extensive statistical physics. The aim is to understand aspects of the underlying physics that lead to the evolution of the earthquake phenomenon introducing the new topic of non-extensive statistical seismology.\nThis research has been funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national resources under the framework of the “THALES Program: SEISMO FEAR HELLARC” project.",

            "abstract": "Lagrangian stochastic particle models provide a well-established theoretical framework for the description of pollutant dispersion in different atmospheric boundary layer scenarios. Such modeling depends on an adequate description of the turbulent processes. Usually turbulent structure in the surface layer is described in terms of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) using universal relationships between scaling parameters. These relationships have been shown to be valid in the case of horizontal homogeneity for stationary turbulence. The description of the turbulent processes above rough surfaces, such as over canopies, is a more complex case. For the urban canopy it was found that under developed stationary turbulence conditions MOST relations are approximately valid (in some cases, with extensions). An even more complex case is that of rough surfaces over topography, as no similarity theory has been established to properly describe the turbulence exchange over heterogeneous surfaces in complex terrain.\nThe Haifa 2009 urban tracer meteorological and dispersion campaign is discussed. We model near-neutral stratification using the full velocity fluctuation covariance matrix and the convective stratification using skewed velocity probability density function. Simulations show good agreement with direct tracer measurements. Turbulence parametrizations were adopted based on their accordance with our measurements and with other measurements and fits from the literature. The characteristics of turbulence in the urban area over topography are discussed. It is shown that in conditions of developed stationary turbulence, at most areas, there is in an agreement with MOST predictions. In contrast, in very low wind conditions the turbulent nocturnal boundary layer is not necessarily stationary and is spatially non-homogeneous, as manifested in the pollutant pattern.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate mineral inclusions are quite rare in diamonds from the upper mantle, but are evidence for a carbonate abundance in the mantle. It is believed that such carbonatitic inclusions originated from high-density fluids (HDFs) that were enclosed in diamond during its growth. Using TEM and EPMA, several kinds of carbonate inclusions have been identified in Yakutian diamonds : aragonite, dolomite, magnesite, Ba-, Sr-, and Fe-rich carbonates. Most of them are represented by multi-phase inclusions of various chemically distinct carbonates, rich in Ca, Mg, and K and associated with minor amounts of silicate, oxide, saline, and volatile phases. Volatiles, leaving some porosity, played a significant role in the diamond growth.\nA single crystal of aragonite (60μm) is herein reported for the first time. This inclusion is located in the center of a diamond from the Komsomolskaya pipe. Careful CL imaging reveals the total absence of cracks around the aragonite inclusion – i.e., closed system. This inclusion has been identified by X-ray diffraction and microprobe analysis.  At temperatures above 1000 0C, aragonite is only stable at high pressures of 5-6 GPa. Inside this aragonite, we observed nanocrystalline inclusions of titanite, Ni-rich sulfide, magnetite, water-bearing Mg-silicate, and fluid bubbles. Dolomite is common in carbonate multi-phase inclusions in diamonds from the Internatsionalnaya, Yubileinaya, and Udachnaya kimberlite pipes. Alluvial diamonds of the northeastern Siberian Platform are divided into two groups based on the composition of HDFs: 1) Mg-rich multi-phase inclusions (60% magnesite + dolomite + Fe-spinel + Ti-silicate + fluid bubbles); and 2) Ca-rich multi-phase inclusions (Ca,Ba-, Ca,Sr-, Ca,Fe-carbonates + Ti-silicate + Ba-apatite + fluid bubbles). High-density fluids also contain K. Volatiles in the fluid bubbles are represented by water, Cl, F, S, CO2, CH4, and heavy hydrocarbons. Origin of the second group of HDFs may be related to the non-silicate carbonatitic melt.\nWe consider the primary hydrous, Сa-rich and Mg-poor carbonate melts as having formed in subducted oceanic crust. Variations of carbonate-inclusion compositions among diamonds indicate the variability in the source media during the formation of diamond and may be the result of metasomatic interaction with host rocks.",

            "abstract": "The Mead Stream section (South Island, New Zealand) consists of a 650-m-thick series of continuous and well-exposed strata deposited on a South Pacific continental slope from the Late Cretaceous to the middle Eocene. We examined the uppermost Paleocene–middle Eocene part of the Mead Stream section, which consists of ~360 m of limestone and marl, for detailed magnetic polarity stratigraphy, calcareous nannofossil, and foraminifera biostratigraphy. Magneto-biostratigraphic data indicate that the section straddles magnetic polarity Chrons from C24r to C18n, calcareous nannofossil Zone from NP9a to NP17 (CNP11–CNE15 following a recently revised Paleogene zonation), and from the Waipawan to the Bortonian New Zealand stages (i.e., from the base of the Ypresian to the Bartonian international stages), encompassing 17 Myr (56–39 Ma) of Southwest Pacific Ocean history. The ages of calcareous nannofossil biohorizons are consistent with low to mid-latitude data from the literature, indicating that during the early–middle Eocene the low-mid latitude calcareous nannofossil domain extended at least to ~50–55°S in the South Pacific. Correlation of the magnetic polarity stratigraphy from the Mead Stream section with the geomagnetic polarity time scale allows us to derive the sediment accumulation rates (SAR), which range between 8 and 44 m/Myr. Comparing the SAR with paleotemperature proxy records, we found that two intervals of increased SAR occurred during the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO; 52–50 Ma) and during the transient climate warming culminating with the middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO; 40.5 Ma). This correlation indicates that the climate evolution of the early–middle Eocene is recorded in the sedimentation patterns whereby times of warmer climate promote continental weathering, transportation, and accumulation of terrigenous sediments.",

            "abstract": "Comet impacts are ubiquitous phenomena in the Solar system and the frequency was extremely high in the early history. Comets contain abundant organic materials, including bio-essential amino acids. Thus, it is proposed that comets have delivered organic molecules, which are important for the origins of life, to the outer solar bodies as well as the Earth.\nIn the study, we conducted shock experiments on icy mixtures of amino acids (glycine and alanine), water ice, and forsterite at cryogenic condition (77 K), simulating comet impacts. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of impact shock on amino acids in comets. We also focused on the oligomerization of amino acids to produce peptides. Peptides are important molecules for the origins of life, because they are building block of proteins and also act as catalysts to form other biomolecules. In the experiments, the starting mixture was kept frozen in a reaction capsule placed in liquid nitrogen (77K) and was impacted by a vertical propellant gun. The shock pressure range achieved in the experiments was 4.8-26.3 GPa.\nThe results showed that amino acids were oligomerized into peptides up to tripeptides by impact shock at cryogenic condition. In addition, the yields of linear dipeptides were higher than those of cyclic diketopiperazines. These results are in contrast to the results of shock experiments to amino acid solutions at room temperature, which resulted in the synthesis of comparable amount of diketopiperazines to that of linear peptides (Blank et al., 2001). Thus, the cryogenic condition at impact shock would be a key to facilitate the formation of linear peptides. If we apply our results to the event of icy satellite formation, comet impacts should play an important role to supply linear peptides to the satellites. The shock-synthesized peptides would have been spread over the subsurface seas of the icy satellites (e.g. Enceladus) and might have been an important source for chemical evolution on the satellites.",

            "abstract": "Migmatites are fantastic targets to study melt compositions, because they represent levels in the crust where melting has occurred. However, migmatites commonly are products not only of (i) melt producing reactions, but also of (ii) melt loss and (iii) retrograde reactions. Evidence of such events is preserved in the minerals and microstructures of rocks that outcrop in deeply exhumed orogens. The apparent complexity of migmatites is due to their chemical and textural heterogeneity visible in different domains with various mineral assemblages. Partial melting of pelites involves reactions, which are predictable using thermodynamic models. However, a forward modeling approach based on rock-specific equilibrium phase diagrams requires the knowledge of local bulk compositions of each equilibrium assemblage. In this contribution we show how suitable local effective bulk (LEB) compositions can be derived by means of standardized microprobe X-ray images, using the program XMapTools. For chemically heterogeneous samples, such as migmatites, these LEB allow to model the stable mineral assemblages for each domain and to obtain reliable P-T estimates.\nA metapelite studied in detail is embedded within a metasedimentary xenolith in the Marcabeli pluton, El Oro Complex, Ecuador. This sample shows complex mineral patterns due to local melt redistribution (at mm to cm-scale), involving major changes that affect the local chemical composition observed today. Four domains are identified: A residuum domain made of cordierite + biotite + plagioclase + spinel, which is predicted to be stable at P-Tmax conditions of 750 ± 50°C and 2 ± 1 kbar. In the leucosome (plagioclase + Kspar + quartz + biotite + orthopyroxene) three sub-domains show different mineral assemblages. Domain-specific equilibrium assemblages in the P-T diagrams demonstrate that these three assemblages reflect three interconnected melt-rich domains, each with different melt fractions (from 23 to 90%), yet all coexisted at equilibrium near P-Tmax conditions.",

            "abstract": "The thinning of the crust and the exhumation of subcontinental mantle is accompanied by a series of extensional detachment faults. Exhumation of mantle and crustal rocks is intimately related to percolation of fluids along detachment faults leading to changes in mineralogy and chemistry of the mantle, crustal and sedimentary rocks.\nField observation, analytical methods, refraction/reflection and well-core data, allowed us to investigate the role of fluids in the Iberian margin and former Alpine Tethys distal margins and the Pyrenees rifted system. In the continental crust, fluid-rock interaction leads to saussuritization that produces Si and Ca enriched fluids found in forms of veins along the fault zone. In the zone of exhumed mantle, large amounts of water are absorbed in the first 5-6 km of serpentinized mantle, which has the counter-effect of depleting the mantle of elements (e.g., Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Ni and Cr) forming mantle-related fluids.\nUsing Cr-Ni-V and Fe-Mn as tracers, we show that in the distal margin, mantle-related fluids used detachment faults as pathways and interacted with the overlying crust, the sedimentary basin and the seawater, while further inward parts of the margin, continental crust-related fluids enriched in Si and Ca impregnated the fault zone and may have affected the sedimentary basin. The overall observations and results enable us to show when, where and how these interactions occurred during the formation of the rifted margin. In a first stage, continental crust-related fluids dominated the rifted systems. During the second stage, mantle-related fluids affected the overlying syn-tectonic sediments through direct migration along detachment faults at the future distal margin. In a third stage, these fluids reached the seafloor, “polluted” the seawater and were absorbed by post-tectonic sediments.\nWe conclude that a significant amount of serpentinization occurred underneath the thinned continental crust, that the mantle-related fluids might have modified the chemical composition of the sediments and seawater. We propose that the chemical signature of serpentinization that occurs during the mantle exhumation is recorded in the sediments and may serve as a proxy to date serpentinization and mantle exhumation in present day magma-poor rifted margins.",

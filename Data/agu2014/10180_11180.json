            "abstract": "Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) have shown the effects of surface wind waves in enhancing ocean boundary layer mixing, yet this Langmuir mixing process is missing in almost all the state-of-the-art climate models and may contribute to the shallow biases of mixed layer depth in the Southern Ocean and the Northern Atlantic in most climate models.\nIn this study a third generation wave model, WAVEWATCH III, has been incorporated as a component of the Community Earth System Model, version 1.2 (CESM1.2). In particular, the wave model is now coupled with the ocean model through a modified version of the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) including the influence of Langmuir mixing. The misalignment of wind and waves and the effects of Stokes depth are considered in our implementation of Langmuir mixing in KPP.\nWave-ocean only tests show substantial improvements in the upper ocean simulation, including reductions in both the shallow biases of mixed layer depth and the low biases of pCFC-11 in the Southern Ocean. Ocean-Ice-Wave and Atmosphere-Ocean-Ice-Wave coupled tests confirm these improvements when other climate feedbacks are included. Progress toward a more computationally efficient data wave model will be summarized.",

            "abstract": "To better constrain the rheology of the mantle, experimental studies on olivine grain growth have been conducted (Faul and Scott, 2006; Karato, 1989; Nichols and Mackwell, 1991) since the grain size is an important parameter under dynamic regimes (e.g. diffusion creep and grain boundary sliding). In order to better define the melt effect on the rheological response of a partially molten olivine aggregate, we have experimentally investigated the effect of melt on olivine grain growth and the connectivity of this melt phase. Experiments were performed in 3/4” piston cylinders at 500 MPa confining pressure, different temperatures (i.e. 1100°C, 1250°C and 1400°C) and four durations (1h, 12h, 72h and 15 days). Starting material was composed of natural San Carlos olivine (5 μm<grain size<15 μm) containing different amounts (0 wt%, 0.2 wt%, 1 wt% and 10 wt%) of volatile-free basalt (Sifré et al., 2014). San Carlos olivines were previously handpicked and annealed under controlled oxygen fugacity conditions close to the FMQ buffer. After the experiments, the melt connectivity was assessed through scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in backscattered electron mode. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps of each sample were also collected in order to determine the olivine grain sizes as a function of time and melt content.",

            "abstract": "SUMO is an innovative proof-of-concept nanosatellite aiming to measure on the same platform the different components of the Earth radiation budget (ERB), the solar energy input and the energy reemitted at the top of the Earth atmosphere, with a particular focus on the far UV (FUV) part of the spectrum and on the ozone layer. The FUV is the only wavelength band with energy absorbed in the high atmosphere (stratosphere), in the ozone (Herzberg continuum, 200–220 nm) and oxygen bands, and its high variability is most probably at the origin of a climate influence (UV affects stratospheric dynamics and temperatures, altering interplanetary waves and weather patterns both poleward and downward to the lower stratosphere and tropopause). A simultaneous observation of incoming FUV and ozone production would bring an invaluable information on this process of solar-climate forcing. Space instruments have already measured the different components of the ERB but this is the first time that all instruments will operate on the same platform. This characteristic by itself guarantees original scientific results. SUMO is a 3.6 kg, 3W, 10x10x30 cm3 nanosatellite (\"3U\"), with a \"1U\" payload of <1 kg and 1 W. 5 instruments: an ozone meter, a FUV measure at 215 nm, 2 radiometers (0.2 – 3 & 0.2 – 40 µm) and a bolometer. Orbit is polar, Sun-synchronous, ~600 km, since a further challenge are relations between solar UV variability and stratospheric ozone on Arctic and Antarctic regions. Mission is expected to last 1 to 2 years. SUMO definition has been completed (platform and payload AIT are possible in 24 months). SUMO is proposed for the nanosatellite program of Polytechnic School and CNES (following QB50) for a flight in 2018. Follow-up is 2 fold: on one part more complete measurements using SUMO miniaturized instruments on a larger satellite; on the other part, increase of the coverage in local time and latitude using a constellation of SUMO nanosatellites around the Earth to further geolocalize the Sun influence on our planet. Nanosatellites, with cost and risk limited, are also excellent platforms to evaluate technologies for future missions, e.g. nanotechnology ZnO protection barriers to limit contamination from solar panels in the UV and reduce reflection losses in the visible, or MgZnO solar blind detectors (R&D initiatives proposed to CNES).",

            "abstract": "In a simple linear alluvial reach, upstream perturbations of grain size, sediment concentration and water discharge control river aggradation/degradation through their effect on river slope. At the downstream end of the system, base level also controls aggradation/degradation of the riverbed, but without change of river slope. We show that this dichotomy is important as it implies different timescale of adjustment to perturbations. Minimum aggradation time can be computed as a function of slope change or base level rise and sediment supply. Degradation time is more delicate to estimating as it depends partly on poorly constrained parameters such as the erodibility of the substratum. We use an analytical solution of alluvial slope to explore the aggradation problem: how likely is aggradation to record upstream versus downstream signals? For the degradation problem, we use a numerical model of water flow with erosion and deposition. We investigate a range of natural variations in grain size, sediment concentration and water discharge for rivers with similarity with known large fluvial systems such as the Brahmaputra and Mississippi. First results show that aggradation due to base level rise is in most cases faster than aggradation due to grain size increase or water discharge decrease, thus suggesting that such upstream perturbations will likely be overshadowed by base level changes in an icehouse climate, except in the upstream segments of a fluvial system. Perturbations of sediment concentration however are usually transmitted faster, and may thus propagate fully during periods of base level rise. This work emphasizes the competing effects of source area signals versus basin signals in determining aggradation-degradation of fluvial systems and sediment delivery to the basin margin. It confirms in particular the important disconnection between the marine and the fluvial environments during low sea level and decreased rainfall, with implications for sediment delivery to the basin margin and sequence stratigraphy.",

            "abstract": "Detection of low magnitude event is critical and challenging in seismology. Traditional methods of event detection, which rely on phase identification, are usually hindered by low signal to noise ratio (SNR) in small event recordings. We develop a new method, named the match and locate (ML) method, for small event detection. The ML method employs some template events and detects small events through stacking cross-correlograms between waveforms of the template events and potential small event signals in the continuous waveforms over multiple stations and components. Unlike the traditional match filter method which assumes that the template event and slave event are co-located, the ML method scans over potential small event locations around the template, by making relative travel time corrections based on the relative locations of the template event and the potential small event before stacking. It makes event detection more efficient and at the same time relocates the detected event in high-precision. As an example of application and comparison with the matched filter method, we apply the ML and matched filter methods to detect the foreshocks before the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. The ML method detects four times more events than the templates and 10% more than the matched filter under the same detection threshold. Up to 42% of the events detected by the ML method are not co-located at the template locations with the largest event separation of 9.4 km. As another example of application, we apply the ML method to search for potential nuclear tests conducted by North Korea in the continuous seismic data recorded in Northeast China, using North Korea’s 2009 and 2013 tests as templates. We report detection of a low-yield nuclear test conducted by North Korea in 2010.",

            "abstract": "The western rift of Corinth (Greece) is one of the most active tectonic structures of the euro-mediterranean area. Its NS opening rate is 1.5 cm/yr ( strain rate of 10-6/yr) results into a high microseismicity level and a few destructive, M>6 earthquakes per century, activating a system of mostly north dipping normal faults. Since 2001, monitoring arrays of the European Corinth Rift Laboratory (CRL, www.crlab.eu) allowed to better track the mechanical processes at work, with short period and broad band seismometers, cGPS, borehole strainmeters, EM stations, …). The recent (300 kyr) tectonic history has been revealed by onland (uplifted fan deltas and terraces) and offshore geological studies (mapping, shallow seismic, coring), showing a fast evolution of the normal fault system. The microseismicity, dominated by swarms lasting from days to months, mostly clusters in a layer 1 to 3 km thick, between 6 and 9 km in depth, dipping towards north, on which most faults are rooting. The diffusion of the microseismicity suggests its triggering by pore pressure transients, with no or barely detected strain. Despite a large proportion of multiplets, true repeaters seem seldom, suggesting a minor contribution of creep in their triggering, although transient or steady creep is clearly detected on the shallow part of some majors faults. The microseismic layer may thus be an immature, downward growing detachment, and the dominant rifting mechanism might be a mode I, anelastic strain beneath the rift axis , for which a mechanical model is under development. Paleoseismological (trenching, paleoshorelines, turbidites), archeological and historical studies completed the catalogues of instrumental seismicity, motivating attempts of time dependent hazard assessment. The Near Fault Observatory of CRL is thus a multidisciplinary research infrastructure aiming at a better understanding and modeling of multiscale, coupled seismic/aseismic processes on fault systems.",

            "abstract": "I use a simple box model to explore possible differences in the liquid composition of Titan’s seas. Major variations in the abundance of involatile ethane, somewhat analogous to salinity in terrestrial waters, arise from the hydrological cycle, which introduces more “fresh” methane rainfall at the highest latitudes in summer and keeps the system 'off balance'. Comparing the precipitation and evaporation fluxes with likely tidal mixing fluxes, I find the composition of Ligeia Mare to be substantially flushed by methane rainfall which causes it to export its solutes to Kraken via a narrow labyrinth of channels. Ligeia therefore may have a methane-rich (~80%) composition, well out of thermodynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere, whereas the basins of Kraken are relatively well-mixed and will be ethane-dominated (~60%). These composition variations, analogous to Earth’s salinity gradient between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean (or the Baltic and the North Sea) may be detectable with Cassini measurements and are important for future exploration.\nComparing the depth of Ligeia measured at 160m with the annual rainfall predicted by Global Circulation Models of about 10m at the highest latitudes, and assuming a modest catchment area, suggests that Ligeia Mare should undergo only modest seasonal changes in composition, assuming surface 'waters' are mixed into the depths.

            "abstract": "To make a significant impact on anthropogenic CO2 emissions, geologic carbon sequestration would require thousands of CO2 repositories around the world. Unconventional reservoirs, such as igneous rocks and fractured formations, may add substantial storage capacity and diversify CO2 storage options. In particular, basaltic rocks represent a promising target due to their widespread occurrence, potentially suitable reservoir structure and high reactivity with CO2, but a comprehensive evaluation of worldwide CO2 sequestration capacity in unconventional reservoirs is lacking. In this presentation we summarize available data on storage potential of basaltic rocks and fractured formations illustrated by field examples from the Columbia River Basalt, the Newark Rift Basin and IODP Site 1256, and discuss potential limiting factors, such as effective porosity and the risk of inducing earthquakes by CO2 injections.\nLarge Igneous Provinces (LIPs), low-volume flows and intrusions, and ocean floor basalt represent three general classes of basaltic reservoirs, each characterized by different structure and storage capacity. Oceanic plateaus and LIPs are projected to have the highest CO2 storage capacity, on the order of thousands gigatons (Gt) per site, followed by continental LIPs and ocean floor basalts (hundreds to thousands Gt per site). Isolated basalt flows and intrusions are likely to offer only low- to moderate-capacity options. An important limiting factor on CO2 injection volumes and rates is the risk of inducing earthquakes by increasing pore pressure in the subsurface. On continents, available in situ stress analysis suggests that local stress perturbations at depth may create relaxed stress conditions, allowing for pore pressure increase without reactivating fractures and faults. Remote storage sites on oceanic plateaus and below the seafloor are advantageous due to low impact of potential seismic and/or leakage events. Other effects, such as thermal stresses created by temperature difference between injected fluid and the host formation, may be particularly important for reservoir stability in high-temperature offshore locations. Overall, unconventional reservoirs in offshore locations offer the potential benefits of vast and safe storage for captured CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "The relation between ground deformation and caldera development can be studied at the Askja caldera complex at the divergent plate boundary in Iceland. The Lake Öskjuvatn caldera, 4-5 km wide and about 250 m deep, began forming shortly prior to a major explosive eruption in 1875 and continued to grow rapidly for over 2 decades. The boundaries of the caldera collapse remain unstable. A large rockslide on 21 July 2014 of the order of 30-100 million cubicmeters generated a lake tsunami with run up heights of over 30 m. Geodetic measurements at the volcano since 1983 suggest that instability of the basal plane of failure of the rockslide may have steadily increased as the volcano deflated throughout this period. Deformation (subsidence and horizontal contraction) has been mapped by levelling, distance measurements, GPS and satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) using the ERS, Envisat, Radarsat, TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites. An intermediate digital elevation model has been delivered by the TanDEM-X mission. Initial subsidence rate was up to 7 cm/yr, decaying to 2-3 cm in recent years. A large part of the signal can be reproduced by a model with pressure decrease in a spherical source at 3 km depth, interpreted as a pressure drop in a magma chamber, or subsidence may occur over a structurally weak region in relation to plate spreading. The 2014 rockslide has a basal plane of failure passing through intact rock. A section of the basal plane is exhumed by the slide, revealing impressive striations and slip marks. A simple model, assuming uniform elastic halfspace with a rectangular failure plane extending to the surface, indicates that Coulomb stress on the failure plane or a deeper weakness zone under the rockslide, increased by over 2 MPa since 1983 due to the deflation, exceeding the change often associated with stress triggering of earthquakes. Furthermore, the slide occurred in an area of persistent geothermal and seismic activity. Although gravity, geothermal alteration, topography and climate factors are likely to dictate mostly the 21 July 2014 rockslide, our observations and modelling indicate the rockslide is an integral event in the development of the Öskjuvatn caldera, with deflation of the volcano in recent decades contributing to instability of the caldera boundary and failure on the basal plane of the rockslide.",

            "abstract": "Ganymede is the only satellite which has its own magnetosphere, which is embedded in the Jovian magnetosphere (Kivelson et al. 1996). This peculiar interaction has been investigated by means of a 3D parallel multi-species hybrid model based on a CAM-CL algorithm (Mathews et al. 1994). In this formalism, ions have a kinetic description whereas electrons are considered as an inertialess fluid which ensures the neutrality of the plasma and contributes to the total current and electronic pressure. Maxwell’s equations are solved to compute the temporal evolution of electromagnetic field. Hybrid simulations are performed on a uniform cartesian grid with a spatial resolution of about 240 km. Our results are globally consistent with other models and Galileo measurements. Nevertheless, our description of the magnetopause and the ionosphere is not satisfying enough due to the low spatial resolution. Indeed, we want to describe scale heights of 125 km in the ionosphere whereas the best spatial resolution that we are allowed to use is about 240 km. Therefore, in order to obtain more efficient and relevant results, it is necessary to improve the size of the grid. In this optic, we are introducing a multi-grids approach in order to refine the spatial resolution by a factor 2 (~120km) near Ganymede. The creation of a finer mesh in the simulation grid leads to make some peculiar computations at the interfaces between the two different grids, whether for the calculation of moments, such as charge density or current, or the computation of electromagnetic fields. Moreover, the parallelization of the code, based on domain decomposition methods, imposes us to take care of boundary conditions. In the hybrid model, macroparticules, which represent a kind of cloud of physical particles, have a volume equal to that of a grid cell. Then, the macroparticules entering into the higher spatial resolution region are splited into smaller macroparticules whose the volume corresponds to the volume of a cell of the finer mesh. The improvement of the spatial resolution in the hybrid model will also allow us to relevantly couple the results of this model with those of our 3D multi-species exospheric model (Turc et al. 2014), into a test-particle model that describes the ionosphere of Ganymede. Basic tests and validation results of the multi-grids approach are presented.",

            "abstract": "Temporary rivers, those rivers that periodically cease to flow, constitute over half of the total discharge of the global river network and are expected to increase in extent as a consequence of climatic shifts and water resource development. Despite their ubiquity, projected increased frequency, and ecological significance, the spatial and temporal controls on flow permanence remain poorly understood. Hydrogeomorphic research to date on temporary rivers has primarily focused on network expansion and contraction patterns with comparatively little consideration of mechanistic controls on temporary streamflow dynamics. The present work integrates hydrologic, geomorphic, and land cover processes across spatiotemporal scales that control streamflow dynamics in temporary rivers that are meaningful to ecological research in these systems. We first present a conceptual diagram that describes spatiotemporal expansion and contraction cycles of temporary rivers. Spatiotemporal dynamics of network expansion and contraction are complex; however, commonalities in wetting and drying patterns and degrees of connectivity exist at network (>103m), reach (101-3m), and local (<101m) spatial scales. Next, we propose a spatiotemporal framework to evaluate hydrologic, geomorphic, and land cover controls on temporary streamflow based on a synthesis of the current state of knowledge. For example, we identify specific precipitation patterns and watershed characteristics that influence flow permanence across spatial and temporal scales that range from the watershed to sub-meter and millennial to hours. Finally, we discuss research priorities for temporary rivers that can elucidate confounding interactions and directionality of hydrology, geomorphology, and land cover on flow permanence. Two methods priorities for future field research are: use of tracers and isotopes for identifying age, sources, and pathways of water within a riverscape and monitoring networks for assessing spatiotemporal patterns of surface and subsurface flow within temporary river networks. Currently, we are forced to infer from studies of perennial rivers and a few well studied temporary rivers. Further temporary river specific research is required to test and validate our assertions.",

            "abstract": "Soil-atmosphere exchange is an important transport process influencing environmental fate and transport of many persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This study focuses on modelling the gaseous exchange of a semi-volatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (phenanthrene) between soil and the atmosphere using the multicomponent reactive transport code MIN3P. MIN3P is typically applied to simulate aqueous and vapor phase subsurface transport and reaction processes. We extended the code to also include an atmospheric boundary layer where eddy diffusion and photodegradation take place. The relevant processes and parameters affecting soil-atmosphere exchange were investigated in several scenarios and at various time scales. We found that phenanthrene is well-mixed in the atmospheric boundary layer under neutral or stable atmospheric conditions due to fast eddy diffusion. Uptake of airborne phenanthrene to soils is limited by the soil properties and initially depends on diffusion in soil gas and sorption to the solids. On the long term seepage water dominates transport into deeper soil layers; biodegradation finally leads to steady-state concentration profiles in the subsurface typically achieved after a few centuries. If concentrations in the atmosphere decrease, e.g. due to environmental legislation, then soils become sources for the POPs for the first two months and function as sinks again for the POPs until new steady state concentrations are reached (after decades to centuries). MIN3P was also used to simulate diurnal soil-atmosphere exchanges of airborne pollutants due to temperature changes and photodegradation, both which cause fluctuations in atmospheric concentrations and therefore affect mass transfer between soil and the atmosphere. The model can further be applied to estimate the environmental fate of other POPs between soil and the atmosphere under different environmental pollution and climate change scenarios.",

FADN is an instrument for evaluating the income of agricultural holdings and the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy.\nCrops were selected based on incidence of cultivated area on the total arable land of FADN farms net. Among others, the database contains data on irrigation management (irrigated surface, length of irrigation season, volumes of water, etc.), and crop production. Meteorological data series were obtained by a combination of local weather stations and ECAD E-obs spatialized database.\nCrop water footprints were evaluated against water availability and risk of desertification maps of Italy. Further, we compared the crop water footprints obtained with our methodology with already existing data from similar studies in order to highlight the effects of spatial scale and level of detail of available data.",

            "abstract": "Global wetland methane (CH4) emissions and its spatiotemporal patterns were evaluated using a new process-based model called TRIPLEX-GHG. The model was developed based on the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), coupled with a new CH4 biogeochemistry module and a water table module to simulate CH4 emission processes in natural wetlands. The model has been validated using a number of field observations successfully. This study reported the initial results of global scale application, including total CH4 emissions, spatiotemporal patterns, and contributions to the atmospheric CH4 fluctuations. Global annual wetland CH4 emission ranged from 150 TgC yr-1 to 174 TgC yr-1 between 1901 and 2012 with the peak occurring in 1991 and 2012. Between 1990 and 2010, global CH4 emission decreased with a rate of approximately 0.38 TgC yr-1. It was largely due to the decrease of CH4 emissions from topical wetlands, which had a decreasing trend with a rate of 0.33 TgC yr-1 since the 1970s. CH4 emissions from tropical, temperate, and high latitude wetlands comprised 63%, 22% and 15% of global CH4 emission, respectively. Tropical wetlands are the primary contributor of the inter-annual variability of global wetland CH4 emissions as well as atmospheric CH4. The stable-to-decreasing wetland CH4 emissions owing to the balance of emissions between tropical and extratropical wetlands was a contributing factor to the slow-down atmospheric CH4 growth rate during 1990s. The rapid drop in tropical wetland CH4 emissions from 2000 onwards is supposed to offset the increases of the anthropogenic CH4 emissions, hence leading to a relatively stable level of atmospheric CH4 during 2000-2006. Increases of wetland CH4 emissions particularly after 2010 can be considered as an important contributor to the resumed growth of atmospheric CH4 since 2007 and for further increasing in the near future.",

            "abstract": "The association between cold-water coral mounds and contourite drift deposits has been demonstrated in the Belgica mound province, off Ireland. On that location, IODP expedition 307 was able to drill through the base of a mound, dating mound initiation at 2.65 Ma. However, the Belgica mounds are just one of the many expressions of mound growth. More enigmatic is the buried Magellan mound province, located in the northern part of the Porcupine Basin, featuring over 1000 relatively closely spaced buried mounds, which are all rooted on a common reflector. This indicates a common start-up event, but the true driving forces behind their initial settling, growth and demise are still unknown. The influence of bottom currents cannot be ruled out, since clear obstacle marks are present surrounding the mounds. In 2013, some 3000 km south of the Magellan mounds, a new province of buried mounds was discovered along the Moroccan Atlantic Margin, which may shed new light on the “life” cycle of mounds. Here, we report the preliminary results and propose a first view on the controls, interactions and connectivity between these 2 provinces, assisted by a series of studies of contourite drifts along the Eastern Atlantic Margin.\nThe newly discovered buried mounds can be associated to a vast province of several clusters of seabed mounds. They occur in water depths between 500 and 1000 m, buried under up to 50 m of sediment. With respect to the Magellan mounds, they are smaller, but more importantly, they do not root on one single stratigraphic level. At least 4 different initiation levels were identified. The off-mound reflectors indicate a slight influence of bottom currents, since the mounds are located in a large sediment drift. Moreover, the link between the two buried mound provinces may be found in connecting the evolution of the associated contourite drift systems, respectively in Porcupine Seabight and the Gulf of Cádiz. Intermediate sites on Goban Spur and near Le Danois Bank have enabled to correlate stratigraphic events over such large distances, mainly driven by changes in the Mediterranean Outflow Water. However, the influence of the Antarctic Intermediate Water on the Moroccan Margin may not be underestimated, suggesting a linkage between the dynamics of both water masses in the southern Gulf of Cádiz.",

We suggest some strategies and options to both increase the use of green chemistry principles and to also increase stakeholders’ understanding of the importance and utility of green chemistry in their daily lives.

            "abstract": "The Re-Os isotope system has become increasingly used as a tracer of lithological heterogeneity in the convecting mantle, with radiogenic 187Os/188Os in high-Os oceanic basalts and picrites widely interpreted as evidence of a melt contribution from ancient recycled oceanic crust. When combined with 206Pb/204Pb and O isotopes, 187Os/188Os ratios have been used to identify distinct lithological units (i.e. sediments, gabbros and basalts). We report new 187Os/188Os for basalts with high Os (>40 ppt) and MgO from Galápagos, which range from near primitive mantle values (0.130) to highly radiogenic (0.155). While co-variations in 187Os/188Os and 206Pb/204Pb for some Galápagos basalts (Floreana-type) are HIMU like, and consistent with melting of ancient recycled oceanic crust, others have variable 187Os/188Os ratios and primitive to depleted mantle like 206Pb/204Pb. Similar variations in Os and Pb isotopic space have been interpreted in other OIB suites as melts from recycled ancient oceanic gabbros, entrained by upwelling mantle plumes. Nevertheless, a marked east-west spatial variation in 187Os/188Os of Galápagos basalts does not correlate with postulated lithological variations in the Galápagos plume (Vidito et al., 2013). We show that basalts in eastern Galápagos with elevated 187Os/188Os and positive Sr anomalies occur in the vicinity of over-thickened 10 Ma gabbroic crust, that formed when the Galápagos plume was on-axis. We propose the elevated 187Os/188Os of Galápagos basalts are due to in-situ assimilation of young gabbroic lower crust, with high Re/Os, rather than melting of ancient recycled material in the Galápagos plume. In western Galápagos recent plume accreted crust is thick but more mafic, the melt flux higher and assimilation more sporadic.\nThe contamination thresholds of Os and MgO in Galápagos basalts occur at higher contents than for many global OIBs (Azores, Iceland, Hawaii) and may reflect both a relatively low melt flux into the crust from the weak Galápagos plume (Tp=1400 oC) and excess thickness of ridge-formed gabbro in the east of the archipelago. Similar in-situ assimilation of lower oceanic crust by high-Os and MgO-rich OIBs suites may have been overlooked in the quest for establishing melting of ancient recycled oceanic gabbro in hotspots and heterogeneity in the convecting mantle.",

            "abstract": "The complex three-dimensional (3D) structure of tropical forests generates a diversity of light environments for canopy and understory trees. Light availability in tropical forests is dynamic on diurnal and seasonal timescales based on variability in solar illumination and the fraction of diffuse radiation. The distribution of light availability ultimately controls light utilization—the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) available for photosynthesis. Understanding the dynamics of light utilization is critical for interpreting measurements of net ecosystem exchange and improving ecosystem models. Here, we used the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to simulate 3D light profiles for a range of Amazon forest scenes. DART was initialized using small footprint airborne lidar data, and characteristics of each 3D simulation were constrained using local measurements of leaf properties, incident PAR, and atmospheric conditions. For each simulation, we separated the fraction of absorbed PAR (FAPAR) into light interactions with leaves, branches, and the ground surface. Leaf-absorbed PAR in each 1 m3 voxel was further constrained to account for light saturation effects. Under midday illumination conditions, most canopy leaves were saturated, leading to a reduction in light utilization (0.65 - 0.7) even as leaf-absorbed PAR remained nearly constant (0.82-0.84). Light utilization also varied seasonally, with lowest fractional utilization in the dry season. Clear sky conditions and low solar zenith angles accentuated shadowing and saturation effects during dry season months, decreasing light utilization by 20-25% compared to total leaf-absorbed PAR. These findings suggest that a potential response of Amazon forests to increasing PAR in the dry season, as measured at the top of canopy, is moderated by seasonal variability in light utilization from changes in shadowing and saturation effects at the leaf level. Our results point to the need for additional spatial information on forest structure to improve the representation of light availability in models of tropical forest productivity.",

            "abstract": "The 2011-2012 activity at Cordon Caulle has provided an unprecedented opportunity to observe a sustained explosive rhyolitic eruption. An initial 27 hour Plinian phase commenced on 4 June 2011, followed by ten months of hybrid explosive-effusive activity, which generated disruptive ≤6 km ash plumes. In January 2012 our close observations of the active vent[1] revealed how episodic release of gas and ash from several sub-vents on an incipient lava dome (Fig. 1b) merged to form a sustained ash plume. Sub-vents ranged from metric point sources to arcuate fractures (>10 m) in the dome carapace.\nWe visited the vent in January 2014, and found two ~50 m-wide, rubble-strewn vent areas adjacent to pancake-like obsidian domes, all within a breached, ~100 m-high tuff cone. Vent areas consist of fractured obsidian lava strewn by loose, rotated lava blocks ≤5 m across. Prominent red fracture surfaces (Fig. 1 d,e) occur in both the in-situ lava and the blocky veneer; these closely correspond to the type of sub-vents observed in 2012[1]. They range from smooth, curviplanar surfaces extending over several m to complex smaller-scale surfaces that follow pre-existing cooling joints in the lava carapace. In-situ fracture surfaces display prominent, predominantly vertical grooves and impact marks, but negligible displacement.\nSurfaces are coated by µm-mm thick veneers of fine-grained ash, to which larger ash-coated clasts have adhered. Veneer thickness and sintering degree strongly decrease towards the upper carapace of the lava. SEM analysis of ash veneers reveals 1) a high proportion of sub-micron clasts, 2) strong clast sintering, 3) abundant ash aggregation textures spanning submicron-mm scales, and 4) local surface scouring and corrosion of glass and phenocrysts.\nDuring ash venting the smallest particles are preferentially trapped on fracture surfaces and rapidly sintered, encouraging sub-vent blockage. Extensive ash aggregation may have been electrostatically aided, with strong charging induced by high venting velocities through narrow fracture networks. Fluctuating gas/ash ratios and velocities, as observed[1], led to periods of both deposition and erosion. Rafting of earlier ash nozzles down the advancing obsidian flow has created a record of evolving vent dynamics.\n1. Schipper C.I. et al., 2013, JVGR 262, 25–37.",

The gneissic sequence is composed of mylonitic gneisses at the bottom and porphyroblastic gneisses on top. Mylonitic gneisses are strongly deformed rocks with abundant garnet and rare biotite. Except for the presence of melt inclusions, microstructures indicating the former presence of melt are rare or absent. Upwards in the sequence garnet decreases whereas biotite increases in proportion. Melt inclusions are present from cores to rims of garnets throughout the entire sequence. Most of the former melt inclusions are now totally crystallized and correspond to nanogranites, whereas some of them are partially made of glass or, more rarely, are totally glassy. They show negative crystal shapes and range in size from ≈5 to 200 micrometers, with a mean size of ≈30-40 micrometers. Daughter phases in nanogranites and partially crystallized melt inclusions include quartz, feldspars, biotite and muscovite; accidental minerals include kyanite, graphite, zircon, monazite, rutile and ilmenite; glass has a granitic composition. Melt inclusions are mostly similar throughout all the gneissic sequence. Some fluid inclusions, of possible primary origin, are spatially associated with melt inclusions, indicating that at some point during the suprasolidus history of these rocks granitic melt and fluid coexisted. Thermodynamic modeling and conventional thermobarometry of mylonitic gneisses provide peak conditions of ≈850 ºC and 12-14 kbar, corresponding to cores of large garnets with inclusions of kyanite and rutile. Post-peak conditions of ≈800-850 ºC and 5-6 kbar are represented by rim regions of large garnets with inclusions of sillimanite and ilmenite, cordierite-quartz-biotite coronas replacing garnet rims, and the matrix with oriented sillimanite. Previous conventional petrologic studies on these strongly deformed rocks have proposed that anatexis started during decompression from peak to post-peak conditions and in the field of sillimanite. The study of melt inclusions shows, however, that melt was already present in the system at peak conditions, and that most garnet grew in the presence of melt.",

            "abstract": "The past 100 years of research on fluvial dunes and their deposits has produced bedform scaling laws based on flow depth, grain size and flow velocity. Such flow-form-deposit scaling is used ubiquitously for a wide range of paleo-environmental interpretations and in predictions of river bed roughness in floods. Recent research from marine environments, density currents, and fluvial flows with strong secondary circulation shows that these laws are often extrapolated beyond the limits of the original research. In submarine density currents, for example, paleo-hydraulic reconstructions commonly predict dune forming flow conditions, but preserved dune cross strata are rarely found. One particular difference between these geophysical flows is the velocity profile shape and bed shear stress that results.\nIn a series of novel laboratory experiments the shape of the mean downstream velocity profile was systematically altered so the velocity maximum was lowered toward the bed through the addition of roughness elements at the water surface; whilst maintaining flow depth and depth-averaged velocities. This produced velocity profile shapes closer to those in density currents, and open-channel flows with strong secondary circulation. The initial lowering of the velocity maximum position increased dune height and length by 250%. The lowest velocity maximum position produced a stable upper-stage plane bed, whilst predictions based on flow depth and mean velocity remained within the dune regime phase-space. The results therefore demonstrate that the vertical position of the downstream velocity maximum can be a better predictor of equilibrium bedform geometries than flow depth or depth averaged velocity and also highlight that paleo-hydraulic reconstructions need to account for the possible variation in profile shape between geophysical flows.\nThis research improves fundamental understanding of fluvial bedform stability and flow-form-deposit scaling laws for extrapolation into in a broader variety of depositional environments beyond open-channel flows.",

            "abstract": "Highly fertile lherzolite and spinel websterite in the Ronda peridotite massif are enriched in Pt and Pd compared to Os, Ir, Ru and Re. The fractionation of the highly siderophile elements (HSE) in these rocks was produced by reaction of melt with their peridotite and pyroxenite precursors. Modelling indicates that upon reaction primary HSE hosts were dissolved and magmatic sulphides precipitated, largely erasing the original HSE signature of reacting protoliths. The budget of HSE in the melt was controlled by sulphide-silicate partitioning or entrainment of molten sulphide in silicate melt. Rhenium was likely removed from precursor peridotite and pyroxenite by previous melt extraction. Refertilization of peridotite by melts increased Al2O3, CaO, Pt, Pd contents and 187Os/188Os beyond typical values for mantle peridotite and the primitive upper mantle. The interaction of melts with residual peridotite and pyroxenite, as illustrated in the Ronda massif, can generate radiogenic-Os-enriched domains in the mantle with high melt productivity, higher Pt/Os and Pt/Re than common peridotite, and lower Re/Os than typical pyroxenite. As also previously proposed for pyroxenites, these “hybrid” domains can account for the difference in Os isotope compositions between many basalts (e.g., MORB and OIB) and common depleted mantle peridotites.

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions from salt marshes, especially of nitrous oxide (N2O), are a central interest because anthropogenic nutrient loads may substantially alter net climatic forcing of these globally significant ecosystems. In a series of lab and field experiments, a new cavity ring down spectrometer (CRDS, Picarro G2508) that uses mid-infrared (mid-IR) frequencies to measure N2O was compared to a near-IR gas analyzer (LGR N2O/CO analyzer). The Picarro G2508 reports N2O as well as CO2 and CH4 concentrations roughly every second at the parts per billion level. Responses of N2O fluxes to experimental ammonium nitrate additions in marsh mesocosms and marsh plots in situ were compared among these analyzers, along with minimum detectable N2O fluxes. At fluxes above 150 µmol N2O m-2 d-1, the Picarro G2508 and LGR analyzers performed similarly in both mesocosm and field plots that had been enriched with ammonium nitrate, however there were significantly lower minimum detectable N2O fluxes (about 1 order of magnitude) for the LGR than for the Picarro. A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC 2014) was also used to test calibration of the G2508. These experiments suggest that mid-IR CRDS technology offers a new tool for simultaneous analyses of N2O along with CO2 and CH4, which fills an important need for quantifying the net climatic forcing of ecosystems. However based on relatively high minimum N2O detection levels of the CRDS, it may work best in highly eutrophic environments.",

            "abstract": "Scientists use myriad tools to reconstruct past surface ocean conditions to develop a comprehensive image of our Earth. Corals are often utilized to create high-resolution records of sea surface temperature, local salinity or precipitation, and overall reef health via geochemical analyses. Paleoceanography is often a completely foreign topic for younger students or is taught in an abstract way unaccompanied by lab experiences for older students. Additionally, it is quite rare for students to be regularly interacting with marine organisms and coastal processes, weakening their connection to the ocean. In order to strengthen this bond and help students to understand the global impacts of a distant ocean it is sometimes necessary to bring the coral reef to the classroom. Using modeling clay and large straws students can take their own coral cores and examine the alternating clay layers to create their own chronology. Different clay colors represent a spectrum of environmental conditions. Students can reconstruct the oceanic conditions according to their coral core and begin to appreciate the wealth of information stored in these reef structures. The goals of this activity are to introduce students to paleoceanography and teach just one of many ways that scientists can learn about the past. Ideally students will begin to cultivate an appreciation for the ocean and its role in the climate system.",

It is also intended for teachers and interpreters who interact with members of this population and professionals working with Earth science education programs during field trips, internships etc.\nThe signed SESD terms have been incorporated into a Mobile Communication App (MCA). This App for Androids is intended to facilitate communication between English speakers and persons who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL) or Signed English. It can translate words, phrases, or whole sentences from written or spoken English to animated signing. It can also fingerspell proper names and other words for which there are no signs.\nFor our presentation, we will demonstrate the interactive features of the SigningAvatar® accessibility software that support the three principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and have been incorporated into the SESD and MCA.

            "abstract": "Rapid and drastic environmental change has occurred frequently on Earth, posing a critical challenge to life. However, directional selection has overcome those challenges and driven life on our planet to ever increasing diversity and complexity. Based on our knowledge of the natural history of Earth, the effect of drastic environmental changes on a planet’s biosphere can be attributed to three main factors: (1) the nature and time scale of change, (2) the composition of the biosphere prior to change, and (3) the nature of the environment following the change. Mars has undergone even larger environmental changes than Earth, from habitable conditions under which the origin of life (or transfer of life from Earth) seem plausible, to a dry and cold planet punctuated by wetter conditions. Given its planetary history, life on Mars could have retreated to a psychrophilic lifestyle in the deep subsurface or to environmental near-surface niches, such as hydrothermal regions and caves. Further, strong directional selection could have pushed putative martian life to evolve alternating cycles between active and dormant forms, as well as the innovation of new traits adapted to challenging near-surface conditions (e.g., use of H2O2 or perchlorates as antifreeze compounds).",

            "abstract": "Accurate characterization of uncertainties in precipitation estimates derived from space-borne measurements is critical for many applications including water budget studies or prediction of natural hazards caused by extreme rainfall events. GPM precipitation level II estimates are compared to the NEXRAD-based precipitation estimates derived from NOAA/NSSL’s Multi-Radar, Multisensor (MRMS) platform. The NEXRAD network has undergone an upgrade in technology with dual-polarization capabilities. These new polarimetric variables are being incorporated in MRMS to improve quality control of reflectivity data and to correct for partial beam blockages. The MRMS products, after having been adjusted by rain gauges and passing several quality controls and filtering procedures, are 1) accurate with known uncertainty bounds and 2) measured at a resolution below the pixel sizes of the GPM radar and radiometer observations. They are used by a number of NASA investigators to evaluate level II and level III satellite rainfall algorithms. The at-launch GPM Radiometer algorithm uses matches of coincident overpasses of various radiometers with surface rainfall from the MRMS database developed for the GPM project. Statistics from TRMM level II products serve as a benchmark to evaluate GPM precipitation estimates. Comparisons have been carried out at fine scale (e.g. instantaneous and 5 km for DPR) within a comparison framework developed to examine the consistency of the ground and space-based sensors in term of precipitation detection, characterization (e.g. convective, stratiform) and quantification. Specific error factors for passive (e.g. surface conditions for GMI) and active (e.g. attenuation of the radar signal, non uniform beam filling for DPR) sensors are investigated. Systematic biases and random errors quantified at the satellite estimation scale are useful for satellite-based Level III precipitation products. An online validation tool was designed to provide, for the first time, statistical evaluations and graphical representations of the uncertainties with GPM precipitation estimates over the CONUS. This cross-platform error characterization ultimately acts as a bridge to intercalibrate active and passive microwave measurements from the GPM core satellite to the constellation satellites.",

These new technologies are anticipated to improve measurement accuracies such that: dynamic relative gravimeters would be accurate to < 1 milliGal; static relative gravimeters would be accurate to < 1 microGal; and static absolute gravimeters would be accurate to < 10 nanoGal. With instruments that are sensitive to signals several magnitudes smaller than currently possible, the question arises about which dynamic effects of the natural and manmade environments will affect these more sensitive instruments.\nThis talk will attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge on forces that produce dynamic gravity effects and dynamic forces that could affect the ability to make gravity measurements with new instrumentation at nanoGal levels. Some examples of processes that produce dynamic gravity signals include: earth and ocean tides, fluid withdrawal in the subsurface, atmospheric density changes, earthquakes, and glacial isostatic adjustment. A separate set of dynamic environmental factors affect the ability to make accurate gravity measurements, including: movement of humans or other mass near sensitive instruments, vibrations, vehicle motion for kinematic measurements, environmental forcing on field absolute gravimeters, etc. These effects will be considered for not only their magnitudes, but also their spatial scales (from continental to within the immediate vicinity of the gravity instrument) and their uncertainties. The goal of this work is to provide guidance on which dynamic gravity effects are well known and which are not, as well as what corrections may needed for future gravity measurements.",

            "abstract": "The seismic volcanostratigraphic distribution of breakup magmatic complexes and sub-basalt imaging around ODP Hole 642E provide new constrains on initial breakup processes and the subsequent Vøring Margin evolution. The recovered samples at Hole 642E where interpreted as two distinct volcanic series. The Upper Series, represents a seaward dipping reflector wedge (SDR), of transitional tholeiitic lava flows and thin volcaniclastic sediments. In contrast, the Lower Series is built of evolved dacitic/andicetic flows, some highly depleted sills and thicker interbedded sediments. Downhole geochemical variations based on recent analyses define a decreasing continental crustal influence from continental crustal anatectic melts in the Lower Series to purely MORB-like rocks in the Upper Series.\nThe deep imaging of the Lower Series on reprocessed seismic data allows the definition of a new seismic facies unit characterized by wavy to continuous subparallel reflections with an internal disrupted and hummocky shape. Some borehole samples from this seismic facies unit show hydrothermal alteration and devitrification. This unit is interpreted as subaqueous flows and sills intruded and extruded in wet sediment. The top boundary is defined as a negative polarity reflection interpreted as the K reflector and representing a transition between upper tholeiitic and lower dacitic/andesitic lavas. The base of the facies unit corresponds to the base of the breakup extrusive complexes with a thickness of up to 2 km toward the continent ocean boundary.\nA revised model is suggested, including (1) the pre-breakup Lower Series crustal anatectic melt volcanism, (2) widespread explosive, subaerial volcanism and pyroclastic rock deposits defining the K reflection, (3) the main volcanic breakup stage with intense MORB-like volcanism and large subsidence leading to the built of the SDR wedge, and (4) late breakup volcanism accompanied by jumping of the volcanic activity, the accretion of newly formed oceanic crust with decreasing subsidence. The thicker basaltic rocks correspond to the SDR with local depocenters of more than 6 km documenting spatial variations of melt accommodation. We suggest that the inherited rift geometry controls not only the accommodation space but also the growth of the SDR wedge.",

            "abstract": "The Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other water management agencies have an interest in developing reliable, science-based methods for incorporating climate change information into longer-term water resources planning. Such assessments must quantify projections of future climate and hydrology, typically relying on some form of spatial downscaling and bias correction to produce watershed-scale weather information that subsequently drives hydrology and other water resource management analyses (e.g., water demands, water quality, and environmental habitat). Water agencies continue to face challenging method decisions in these endeavors: (1) which downscaling method should be applied and at what resolution; (2) what observational dataset should be used to drive downscaling and hydrologic analysis; (3) what hydrologic model(s) should be used and how should these models be configured and calibrated? There is a critical need to understand the ramification of these method decisions, as they affect the signal and uncertainties produced by climate change assessments and, thus, adaptation planning.\nThis presentation summarizes results from a three-year effort to identify strengths and weaknesses of widely applied methods for downscaling climate projections and assessing hydrologic conditions. Methods were evaluated from two perspectives: historical fidelity, and tendency to modulate a global climate model’s climate change signal. On downscaling, four methods were applied at multiple resolutions: statistically using Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation, Bias Correction Constructed Analogs, and Asynchronous Regression; dynamically using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Downscaling results were then used to drive hydrologic analyses over the contiguous U.S. using multiple models (VIC, CLM, PRMS), with added focus placed on case study basins within the Colorado Headwaters. The presentation will identify which types of climate changes are expressed robustly across methods versus those that are sensitive to method choice; which method choices seem relatively more important; and where strategic investments in research and development can substantially improve guidance on climate change provided to water managers.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial terraces are utilized in geomorphic studies as recorders of land-use, climate, and tectonic history. Advances in digital topographic data, such as high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from airborne lidar surveys, has promoted the development of several methods used to extract terraces from DEMs based on their characteristic morphology. The post-glacial landscape of the Sheepscot River watershed, Maine, where strath and fill terraces are present and record Pleistocene deglaciation, Holocene eustatic forcing, and Anthropocene land-use change, was selected to implement a comparison between terrace mapping methodologies. At four study sites within the watershed, terraces were manually mapped to facilitate the comparison between fully and semi-automated DEM-based mapping procedures, including: (1) edge detection functions in Matlab, (2) feature classification algorithms developed by Wood (1996), (3) spatial relationships between interpreted terraces and surrounding topography (Walter et al., 2007), and (4) the TerEx terrace mapping toolbox developed by Stout and Belmont (2014). Each method was evaluated based on its accuracy and ease of implementation. The four study sites have varying longitudinal slope (0.1% – 5%), channel width (<5 m – 30 m), relief in surrounding landscape (15 m – 75 m), type and density of surrounding land use, and mapped surficial geologic units. In general, all methods overestimate terrace areas (average predicted area 136% of the manually defined area). Surrounding topographic relief appears to exert the greatest control on mapping accuracy, with the most accurate results (92% of terrace area mapped by Walter et al., 2007 method) achieved where the river valley was most confined by adjacent hillslopes. Accuracy decreased for study sites surrounded by a low-relief landscape, with the most accurate results achieved by the TerEx toolbox (Stout and Belmont, 2014; predicted areas were 45% and 89% of manual delineations). Our work informs future studies by highlighting the strengths and drawbacks of each method tested and by making recommendations for the types of geomorphic settings where each is most appropriate. The tested algorithms represent powerful new ways to analyze landscape history over large regions using high-resolution, lidar DEMs.",

            "abstract": "The Atacama Fault System (AFS) is an active trench-parallel fault, located above the down-dip end of coupling of the north Chilean subduction zone. About 3 M=7 Earthquakes in the past 10 ky have been documented in the paleoseismological record, demonstrating the potential of large events in the future. To investigate the current surface creep rate and to deduce the mode of strain accumulation, we deployed an array of 11 creepmeters along four branches of the AFS. This array monitors the interaction of earthquake activity on the subduction zone and a trench-parallel fault in the overriding forearc. The displacement across the fault is continuously monitored with 2 samples/min with a resolution of 1μm. Collocated seismometers record the seismicity at two of the creepmeters, whereas control of the regional seismicity is provided by the IPOC Seismological Networks.\nContinuous time series of the creepmeter stations since 2009 show that the shallow segments of the fault do not creep permanently. Instead the accumulation of permanent deformation occurs by triggered slip recorded as well-defined steps caused by local or remote earthquakes. The 2014 Mw=8.2 Pisagua Earthquake, located close to the creepmeter array, triggered large displacement events on all stations. Another event recorded on all stations was the 2010 Mw=8.8 Maule earthquake located 1500km south of the array. All of the stations showed a triggered displacement event 6-8 min after origin time of the main shock, at the same time as the arrival of the surface waves recorded at nearby IPOC stations. This points to a dynamic triggering process caused by transient stresses during passage of the surface wave. Investigation of seismic events with Magnitudes <6 show displacement events triggered during P and S wave passage, pointing to static as well as dynamic stress changes for proximal events.\nAnalyzing the causative earthquakes we find that the most effective way to trigger displacement events on the AFS are deep (>100km) earthquakes on the subduction zone interface up to 300 km east of the array. Earthquakes located to the west of the AFS on the locked part of the subduction zone interface rarely trigger displacement events on the AFS. Only if such events are as large as the Pisagua Earthquake or its Mw= 7,6 aftershock, they trigger large displacement events.",

For example, they transfer energy from the solar wind or ring current into the Earth's ionosphere via Joule heating. In this study, we use NASA Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite data to investigate the spatial, frequency, and geomagnetic activity dependence of the ULF wave Poynting vector (electromagnetic energy flux) mapped to the ionosphere. We use these measurements to estimate Joule heating rates. We compare these rates to empirical models of Joule heating associated with large scale, static (on ULF wave timescales) current systems, finding that ULF waves usually contribute little to the global, integrated Joule heating rate. However, there are extreme cases when ULF waves make significant contributions to global Joule heating. Finally, we find ULF waves routinely make significant contributions to local Joule heating rates near the noon and midnight local time sectors, where static current systems nominally contribute less to Joule heating; the most important contributions come from lower frequency (<7 mHz) waves.",

            "abstract": "The onset of the Amazon rainy season shows a large temporal and spatial variability, delays on the date of the onset will have strong impacts on local agriculture, hydroelectric power generation as well as on the hydrology of large rivers. Two “once-in-a-century” droughts occurred in 2005 and 2010, and it was shown that in those events the rainy season started later than normal, and also that on the last 10 years the dry season has increased in length by about one month. These events highlight the urgency for improving our understanding and capability to model onset of the rainy season and drought variability, for the present and future. Most studies have attributed the variability of the rainy season onset over Amazonia to the variability of the tropical oceans whether other factors, such as climate change, land use and aerosols also contribute to the variability are not clear..\nGlobal climate models run on seasonal climate forecast mode still show large uncertainties on the prediction of onset of seasonal rains. As for climate change, the CMIP3 and CMIP5 appear to underestimate the past variability, and also project virtually no future change of the onset of rainy season over the Amazon even when they are forced by strong greenhouse forcing under the RCP8.5 emission scenario. Why these models underestimate the variability of the rainy season onset, and whether this bias implies an underestimate of sensitivity of their dry season length to anthropogenic radiative forcing remain unclear.\nThis FAPESP DOE grant 2013/50538 aims to explore use of the measurements provided by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facilities (AMF)-GoAmazon and the Cloud processes of the main precipitation systems in Brazil (CHUVA) Field Experiments, along with global and regional model experiments, to explore the sources of the above described uncertainty. The project will address several issues, i.e. the inadequate representation of the types of convection (i.e., maritime versus continental) and their relationships to aerosols, land surface and atmospheric circulation as represented in climate models We will present our initial results addressing the factors that control the variability of the wet season onset over Amazonia, the influence of convective types on atmospheric diabatic heating based on GoAmazon and CHUVA.",

            "abstract": "The displacement of a fluid by another in porous media is affected by the wetting properties of the medium. While the wettability can vary significantly, its impact is poorly understood. Here, we study the effect of wettability on the invasion patterns via a pore-scale model. We simulate the invasion of an inviscid fluid into a medium saturated with a viscous fluid, for various contact angles and injection rates. We show that increasing the contact angle (making the invading fluid more wetting) stabilizes the invasion front. In particular, at low injection rates, the invasion pattern becomes compact despite of the large, unfavorable viscosity ratio. These results compare favorably with experiments, in which air is injected in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with chemically-treated glass beads and saturated with water/glycerol. Our simulations suggest that the stabilization of the invasion front is due to the increasing dominance of cooperative, non-local invasion mechanisms. For nonwetting invasion (small contact angles, or drainage), the dominant mechanism is Haines jumps, which are controlled by the local pressure drop across individual menisci, whereas for wetting invasion (large contact angles, or imbibition) the stability of individual menisci depends on adjacent parts of the interface.",

This 8-week long program is designed for mid-career graduate students in related fields to come to LANL, receive lectures on space physics and space environment topics, and carry out a research project under the mentorship of LANL staff members. On average we have accepted ~10 students per year to the program, with a strong applicant pool to choose from. This type of summer school program is relatively unique in the space physics community—there are several other summer schools but they are of shorter duration and do not include the mentor-research project aspect which builds a strong one-on-one connection between the summer student and his/her LANL mentor(s). From the LANL perspective, this program was intended to have several benefits including building collaborations between LANL staff and universities and recruitment of potential postdocs. From the student perspective, this program is not only an educational opportunity but a strong networking opportunity and a chance to enhance their professional skills and publication record. Students are permitted to work on projects directly related to their thesis or on projects in areas that are completely new to them. At the end of the summer school, the students also develop their presentation skills by preparing and giving 20 min presentations on their research projects to the research group. Over the past four years the summer school has increased in popularity, and the feedback from the student participants has been very positive. Alumni of the program have continued collaborations with their mentors, resulting in publications and conference presentations, and one postdoc hire to date.",

            "abstract": "We evaluate proxy reconstructions of Holocene records precipitation in the North American Monsoon region (SW US and northern Mexico) and regions to the south (southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean). Seventy-seven precipitation records are tabulated at 2-3 kyr increments for the past 12 kyr, with results displayed mainly on maps. Sites currently dominated by summer precipitation, coupled with proxy records that distinguish summer vs. winter vegetation are used to estimate summer precipitation. Resulting patterns of precipitation variability are evaluated against SST reconstructions from surrounding tropical seas -eastern tropical Pacific, Gulf of California (GoC), Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which are source areas for summer precipitation.\nDuring the Younger Dryas, ca. 12 ka, widespread drying in southern regions contrasted with evidence for wetter conditions in multiple records from the SW US. By 9 ka wetter conditions had spread to the southern regions, likely reflecting an increased Caribbean low-level jet associated with an enhanced Bermuda High. Pacific westerlies contributed significant winter precipitation to the southwestern US and northernmost Mexico at 9 ka. The modern geographical pattern of summer precipitation was established by 6 ka, as the Bermuda High moved northward following the demise of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. SSTs in the GoC and GoM increased, and the NAM strengthened. Increased regional precipitation differences are apparent by 4 ka, likely reflecting enhanced ENSO variability. Most of the southern region experienced increased precipitation during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), whereas winter drought dominated in the north. In contrast, much of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was characterized by generally drier conditions in Central America and Mexico, with wetter conditions in the SW US. Results are broadly supportive of enhanced La Niña-like conditions during the MCA vs. increased ENSO variability during the LIA.",

Coral reefs, for instance, have been impacted by sedimentation, increased eutrophication, and coastal water contamination. Here we present an overview of a new NASA project to study human impacts in two priority watersheds (Manatí and Guánica). The project uses an interdisciplinary approach that includes historic and recent remote sensing analysis and hydrological, ecological and socio-economic modeling to provide a multi-decadal assessment of change in coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and sandy beaches. The project’s main goal is to evaluate the impacts of land use/land cover changes on the quality and extent of CMEs in priority watersheds in the north and south coasts of Puerto Rico. Methods include assessments of coral reefs benthic communities cover, monitoring of short- and long-term beach geomorphological changes associated with riverine and sediment input, calculation of the economical value of selected CMEs, establish permanent monitoring transects in never before studied coral reef areas, provide recommendations to enhance current coastal policy management practices, and disseminate the results to local stakeholders. This project will include imagery from the Operational Land Imager of Landsat 8 to assess coastal ecosystems extent. Habitat and species distribution maps will be created by incorporating field and remotely-sensed data into an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The social component will allow us to study the valuation of specific CMEs attributes from the stakeholder’s point of view. Our results and the generality of the methodology will provide for its application to other similar tropical locations.",

            "abstract": "Geologic carbon storage in deep saline reservoirs is a promising technology for reducing anthropogenic emissions into the atmosphere. Dissolution of injected CO2 into resident brines is one of the primary trapping mechanisms generally considered necessary to provide long-term storage security. Given that diffusion of CO2 in brine is woefully slow, convective dissolution, driven by a small increase in brine density with CO2 saturation, is considered to be the primary mechanism of dissolution trapping. Previous studies of convective dissolution have typically only considered the convective process in the single phase region below the gas-water contact (GWC) and have ignored the over-lying two-phase region where dissolution actually takes place. Our objective is to improve estimates of the long-term dissolution rate of CO2 into brine by including the two-phase region above the gas-water contact in model simulations. In the two-phase model, there is a capillary transition zone above the GWC over which the brine saturation decreases with increasing elevation. Our simulations show that when the capillary fringe height is small, which corresponds to very low entry pressure, assuming CO2-saturated brine in the two-phase region is well-motivated, as has been assumed in analyses of dissolution without the capillary transition. For typical finite entry pressures, the fringe thickness is finite and upwelling convection currents of fresh, un-carbonated brine must extend above the GWC to saturate the brine with CO2. Our results show the long-term dissolution rate can be enhanced by greater than 3 times the dissolution rates derived from ignoring the capillary transition zone. The single-phase, closed-top dissolution rate is recovered in the limit of vanishing entry pressure.\nThis material is based upon work supported as part of the Center for Frontiers of Subsurface Energy Security, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001114.

            "abstract": "The number of hydraulically active fractures serving as advective contaminant migration pathways facilitating plume migration in fractured rock aquifers cannot be determined with confidence from indirect means such as visual inspection of core, borehole geophysics, and is only inferred from hydraulic tests. However, the position of depth-discrete hydraulic activity may be determined using contaminants or heat as tracers yet spatially detailed profile measurement techniques are required without imparting measurement bias of an open borehole. Contaminant concentration profiles from numerous samples along continuous core from a site contaminated since the early 1980’s and heat injection in the sealed boreholes with high resolution profile monitoring are used to characterize the fracture network .\nHeat pulse tests using active distributed temperature sensing (DTS) were conducted in coreholes sealed with an impermeable flexible liner manufactured by FLUTe (Santa Fe, NM) to detect hydraulically active fracture zones. Using a Silixa ULTIMA-HSTM DTS, temperature data was acquired every 12.6 cm along an optic fiber cable with a spatial resolution of 29 cm. Temperature precision is on the order of 0.02°C for averaged measurements collected over 5 minute intervals. The test consisted of heating the measurement cable for 4 hours and monitoring the cooling process for over 8 hours. The resulting dataset consists of high-resolution temperature profiles at five-minute time steps during the test period. Dolostone rock composes most of the lithology units of the corehole, therefore it is unlikely that there are significant variations in rock thermal diffusivity.\nMultiple, successive temperature profiles were used to identify depth-discrete, hydraulically active flow zones with varying transmissivity based on different rates of heat dissipation. These variations were then compared with independent datasets including detected concentrations of contaminants in numerous rock core samples with depth, visual indication of staining on fracture surfaces in rock core logs, fracture size and intensity identified in the ATV log, and variability in borehole high hydraulic conductivity by continuous packer testing and T-profiling methods.",

            "abstract": "Cosmogenic nuclides in stream sediment have been used to measure catchment-averaged erosion rates for nearly two decades. This has revolutionized understanding of mountain landscape evolution. To accurately reflect average erosion, sampled sediment must be representative of the entire landscape. However, mounting evidence suggests that the different grain sizes common in mountain streams often harbor different cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. This raises a fundamental challenge: what should we sample? A common practice is to sample sand, but this can lead to bias in inferred erosion rates. Overcoming the challenge of representative sampling requires understanding the source of the grain size bias. We demonstrate that variations in sediment sizes across slopes can produce large differences in nuclide concentrations in stream sediment. This emerges from both empirical observations from the Sierra Nevada and from a forward model of landscape erosion. We used the model to explore the kinds of catchments in which bias is likely to arise if we measured nuclides in sand alone. We found that in small or low-relief catchments, modeled nuclides in sand accurately reflect imposed erosion rates. Higher relief may produce a larger bias. For example, by sampling only sand in a catchment where both erosion rates and median grain size increase over 3 km of relief, we could underestimate average erosion rates by a factor of 4. Quantifying a signal of grain size bias in the real world is likely complicated by non-steady erosion processes (e.g. landslides) and other factors. Nevertheless, spatial variations in sediment size across slopes may partly explain observed differences in nuclide concentrations in streams. Using sediment tracing tools in conjunction with cosmogenic nuclides may improve sampling methods in landscapes susceptible to grain size bias. Our approach provides a way to quantify how grain size varies across landscapes and thus improve understanding of weathering and erosion in mountain settings.",

            "abstract": "Strong correlations between atmospheric CO2, Antarctic temperatures, and marine proxy records have hinted that ventilation of the deep Southern Ocean may have played a central role in the variations of CO2 over glacial-interglacial cycles. One proposition is that, in general, the Southern Ocean ventilates the deep more strongly under higher CO2, due to a change in winds and/or the dominance of thermal stratification in a warm ocean, which weakens ocean biological carbon storage. Here, we explore this idea with a suite of multi-millennial simulations using the GFDL CM2Mc global coupled model. The results are, indeed, consistent with increasing ventilation of the Southern Ocean as pCO2 increases above modern. However, they reveal a surprising twist under low pCO2: increased salinity of the Southern Ocean, due in part to weakening atmospheric moisture transport, actually increases ventilation rate of the deep ocean under low pCO2 as well. This implies that a nadir of Southern Ocean ventilation occurs at intermediate pCO2, which the model estimates as being close to that of the present-day. This is at odds with the interpretation that weak ventilation of the deep Southern Ocean was the unifying coupled mechanism for the glacial pCO2 cycles. Rather, it suggests that factors other than the ventilation rate of the deep Southern Ocean, such as iron fertilization, ecosystem changes, water mass distributions, and sea ice cover, were key players in the glacial-interglacial CO2 changes.",

It was a normal fault event with the slip on a fault that trend NNW and a focus approximately 117 km below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico costal plane. The earthquake was widely felt through centro and southern Mexico. In Oaxaca City 133 km to the south a person die of a hearth attack.

One belt runs off the coast following nearly its contour. Here the earthquakes are shallow depth and mostly show a reverse fault mechanism. This belt of seismicity begins at the Los Tuxtlas volcanic field. Another seismic belt is located inland 70 km to the west. Here most earthquakes are of intermediate-depth (108-154 km) focus and normal faulting mechanism.

Recent studies argue that aqueous chemistry in clouds could be responsible for a significant production of SOA (Ervens et al., 2011; Carlton and Turpin, 2013) through oxidative and non-oxidative processes. Aqueous phase reactivity of organic compounds needs to be thoroughly described in models to identify organic molecules available to contribute to SOA mass.\nRecently, new empirical methods have been developed to allow the estimate of HO·reaction rates in the aqueous phase (Doussin and Monod, 2013, Minakata et al., 2009). These methods provide global rate constants together with branching ratios for HO·abstraction and addition on organic compounds of atmospheric interests. Current cloud chemistry mechanisms do not take the different possible pathways into account. Based on these structure-activity relationships, a new detailed aqueous phase mechanism describing the oxidation of hydrosoluble organic compounds resulting from isoprene oxidation is proposed.\nThis new aqueous phase mechanism is coupled with the detailed gas phase mechanism MCM v3.2 (Jenkin et al., 1997; Saunders et al., 2003) through a kinetic of mass transfer parameterization for the exchange between gas phase and aqueous phase. The GROMHE SAR (Raventos-Duran et al., 2010) allows the evaluation of Henry's law constants for organic compounds. Variable photolysis in both phases using the TUV 4.5 radiative transfer model (Madronich and Flocke, 1997) is also calculated.\nThe resulting multiphase mechanism has been implemented in a cloud chemistry model. Focusing on oxygenated compounds produced from the isoprene oxidation, sensitivity tests and comparisons with multiphase experiments performed in the framework of the CUMULUS project in the CESAM atmospheric simulation chamber (Wang et al., 2011) will be presented.\nVolkamer et al., GRL, 33, L17811, 2006.\nCarlton and Turpin, ACP, 13, 10203–10214, 2013.\nErvens et al., ACP, 11069-11102, 2011.\nDoussin and Monod, ACP, 13, 11625-11641, 2013.\nMinakata et al., EST, 45, 3479-3486, 2009.\nJenkin et al., AE, 31, 81, 1997.\nSaunders et al., ACP, 3, 161, 2003.\nRaventos-Duran et al., ACP, 10, 7643-7654, 2010.\nMadronich and Flocke, 1997.\nWang et al., AMT, 4, 2465-2494,2011.",

            "abstract": "The mountainous Southern Andes and Antarctic Peninsula (SAAP) region is one of the most intense sources of Gravity Waves (GWs) on Earth. In austral winter, momentum deposition from orographic GWs into the lower stratosphere from this region can exert a strong drag effect on winds in the polar stratospheric jet. The exact nature of this drag effect is difficult to parameterise operationally in GCMs, and as a result such wave parameterisations are generally poorly constrained by observations.\nUsing COSMIC GPS-RO, we observe high Gravity Wave Potential Energy (GWPE) both directly over the SAAP region and downwind in a long leeward wake stretching more than half way around the globe, and comment on possible relationships between the two features. We also observe a vertical column of GWPE directly over the Southern Andes in both zonal and meridional cross-sections, the latter of which suggests a strong southward advection of orographic GWs into the polar stratospheric jet.\nWe investigate the observed difference in monthly GW climatologies when an approach using only COSMIC profiles in which GW signals have been clearly identified is applied in preference to the traditional all-measurement time-averaged approach, and use this to obtain an estimate of GW intermittency in the SAAP region.\nFinally, we take advantage of the deployment phase of the COSMIC constellation to obtain an estimate of momentum flux in the SAAP region, using the phase difference between pairs of closely spaced profiles to estimate the horizontal wavelengths of resolved GWs. We demonstrate that during the deployment phase, momentum flux estimates derived from COSMIC GPS-RO are comparable to those derived from HIRDLS.",

            "abstract": "Investigation of marine sediment records can help elucidate recent changes in the Arctic Ocean circulation and sea ice conditions. We examine sediment cores from the western Arctic Ocean, representing Late to Early Quaternary age (potentially up to 1 Ma). Previous studies of Arctic sediment cores indicate that interglacial/interstadial periods with relatively high sea levels and reduced ice cover are characterized by vigorous bioturbation, while glacial intervals have little to no bioturbation. Traditional methods for studying bioturbation require physical dissection of the cores, effectively destroying them. To treat this limitation, we evaluate archival sections of the cores using an X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) scanner, which noninvasively images the sediment cores in three dimensions. The scanner produces density sensitive images suitable for quantitative analysis and for identification of bioturbation based on size, shape, and orientation. We use image processing software to isolate burrows from surrounding sediment, reconstruct them three-dimensionally, and then calculate their surface areas, volumes, and densities. Preliminary analysis of a core extending to the early Quaternary shows that bioturbation ranges from 0 to approximately 20% of the core’s volume. In future research, we will quantitatively define the relationship between bioturbation activity and glacial regimes. XCT examination of bioturbation and other sedimentary features has the potential to shed light on paleoceanographic conditions such as sedimentation patterns and food flux. XCT is an alternative, underexplored investigation method that bears implications not only for illustrating paleoclimate variations but also for preserving cores for future, more advanced technologies.",

            "abstract": "The TIE-GCM was recently augmented to include helium and argon, two approximately inert species that can be used as tracers of dynamics in the thermosphere. The former species is treated as a major species due to its large abundance near the upper boundary. The effects of exospheric transport are also included in order to simulate realistic seasonal and latitudinal helium distributions. The latter species is treated as a classical minor species, imparting absolutely no forces on the background atmosphere. In this study, we examine the interplay of the various dynamical terms – i.e. background circulation, molecular and Eddy diffusion – as they drive departures from the distributions that would be expected under the assumption of diffusive equilibrium. As this has implications on the formulation of all empirical thermospheric models, we use this understanding to address the following questions: (1) how do errors caused by the assumption of diffusive equilibrium manifest within empirical models of the thermosphere? and (2) where and when does an empirical model’s output disagree with its underlying datasets due to the inherent limitations of said model’s formulation?",

            "abstract": "We are mapping the topography of upper mantle seismic discontinuities beneath the North Atlantic and surrounding regions by using precursor arrivals to PP and SS seismic waves that reflect off the seismic discontinuities. Numerous source-receiver combinations have been used in order to collect a large dataset of reflection points beneath our investigation area. We analysed over 1700 seismograms from MW>5.8 events using array seismic methods to enhance the signal to noise ratio. The measured time lag between PP (SS) arrivals and their corresponding precursors on robust stacks are used to measure the depth of the transition zone boundaries. The reflectors’ depths show a correlation between the location of known hotspots and a significantly depressed 410 km discontinuity indicating a temperature increase of 50-300 K compared to the surrounding mantle. For the 660 km discontinuity three distinct behaviours are visible: i) normal depths beneath Greenland and at a distance of a few hundred kilometres away from known hotspots, ii) shallower 660 km discontinuity compared with the global average value near hotspots closer to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and iii) very few observations of a 660 km discontinuity at the hotspot locations. We interpret our observations as a large upwelling beneath the southern parts of our study region, possibly due to the South Atlantic convection cell. The thermal anomaly may be blocked by endothermic phase transformation and likely does not extend through the top of the transition zone except for those branches which appear as the Azores, Canaries and Cape Verde hotspots at the surface.",

It is a valuable diagnostic tool for model understanding and for model improvement, it enhances calibration efficiency, and it supports uncertainty and scenario analysis. It is of particular interest for environmental models because they are often complex, non-linear, non-monotonic and exhibit strong interactions between their parameters.\nHowever, sensitivity analysis has to be carefully implemented to produce reliable results at moderate computational cost. For example, sample size can have a strong impact on the results and has to be carefully chosen. Yet, there is little guidance available for this step in environmental modelling. The objective of the present study is to provide guidelines for a robust sensitivity analysis, in order to support modellers in making appropriate choices for its implementation and in interpreting its outcome.\nWe considered hydrological models with increasing level of complexity. We tested four sensitivity analysis methods, Regional Sensitivity Analysis, Method of Morris, a density-based (PAWN) and a variance-based (Sobol) method. The convergence and variability of sensitivity indices were investigated. We used bootstrapping to assess and improve the robustness of sensitivity indices even for limited sample sizes.

            "abstract": "Floodplain storage of organic carbon is an important aspect of the global carbon cycle that is not well understood or quantified. Although it is understood that rivers transport organic carbon to the ocean, little is known about the quantity of stored carbon in boreal floodplains and the influence of fluvial processes on this storage. We present results on total organic carbon (TOC) content within the floodplains of two rivers, the Dall River and Preacher Creek, in the central Yukon River Basin in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska. The results indicate that organic carbon storage is influenced by fluvial disturbance and grain size. The Dall River, which contains a large amount of floodplain carbon, is meandering and incised, with well-developed floodplain soils, a greater percentage of relatively old floodplain surfaces and a slower floodplain turnover time, and finer grain sizes. Preacher Creek stores less TOC, transports coarser grain sizes, and has higher rates of avulsion and floodplain turnover time. Within the floodplain of a particular river, large spatial heterogeneity in TOC content also exists as a function of depositional environment and age and vegetation community of the site. In addition, saturated regions of the floodplains, such as abandoned channels and oxbow lakes, contain more TOC compared to drier floodplain environments. Frozen alluvial soils likely contain carbon that could be released into the environment with melting permafrost, and thus quantifying the organic carbon content in the active layer of floodplain soils could provide insight into the characteristics of the permafrost beneath. The hydrology in these regions is changing due to permafrost melt, and floodplain areas usually saturated could be dried out, causing breakdown and outgassing of carbon stored in previously saturated soils. Ongoing work will result in a first-order estimate of active-layer floodplain carbon storage for the central Yukon River Basin.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that salt application to roads and parking lots in winter is driving a rise in chloride concentrations in streams in the northeastern United States. Our research focuses specifically on salt dynamics in stormwater detention basins, which receive runoff directly from parking lots and detain it before it reaches the stream. The four study basins are located on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca, NY USA. Between summer 2012 and 2014, soil electrical conductivity was continuously monitored inside and outside the basins using Decagon 5TE sensors and dataloggers. In two basins which drain stormwater quickly, conductivity levels changed minimally over the year. However, in the other two basins which drain much slower and often are saturated, conductivity increased through the winter, peaking at 8-10 mS/cm, and then took several months to decrease to baseline levels; thus the basins served as a source of salt to outflowing water even into the summer. This annual variation in soil salinity has implications for plant and microbial communities living in these basins. Research by colleagues has indicated that changing salinity can alter microbial communities and impact biogeochemical processes that play a role in water quality remediation. Thus we are also investigating the impact of salinity on denitrification rates in these basins. All of this information will help us understand what role stormwater detention basins are playing in controlling fluxes of road salt in watersheds, as well as how changing salinity influences the ecosystem services provided by these basins.",

            "abstract": "We present a database of all 10-Be ages dating Greenland ice-sheet (GIS) retreat, enabling (1) better understanding of late deglacial through mid-Holocene behavior of the GIS and (2) independent verification of a prominent ice-sheet model. Several regions in southern and southeastern Greenland show instantaneous deglaciation within uncertainty, suggesting retreat from the coast to the present ice margin occurred over several centuries or less. Regions in western Greenland indicate slower deglaciation, with retreat taking up to several millennia. In three locations (Scoresby Sund, Johannes Jensen Land, and Kangerlussuaq), early deglaciation to the coast (by 15 ka) is observed. This variability may result from regional variation in climate or bedrock topography, leading to different rates of ice retreat. A comparison of the overall distribution of 10-Be ages with temperature records from ice cores and the ocean reveals deglaciation in Greenland is particularly sensitive to ocean warming from 15-8 ka, although atmospheric warming at the time also contributed to ice retreat. Peak deglaciation occurred at 12-11 ka during peak ocean warmth, with a secondary peak at 8-7 ka. The Huy2 ice-sheet model of the last deglaciation of the GIS shows deglacial peaks at similar times (10.5 ka and 7.5 ka) as the 10-Be ages. However, the earlier deglaciation in 10-Be ages is not reflected in the model, and nearly all 10-Be ages are older than their respective ice-sheet model ages. This may be due to systematic inheritance within 10-Be samples, but tight clustering of 10-Be ages suggests these represent actual deglaciation ages instead of random inheritance. Alternately, the model may under-predict deglaciation age due to its relatively coarse resolution, preventing it from including finer-scale topography which may significantly influence ice sheet behavior. The model also does not include ocean temperature forcing, which may have been an important forcing in driving GIS retreat when the ice margins were marine terminating. Future ice-sheet modeling should include oceanic effects to test this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes occurring in oblique tectonic settings often partition between several faults that accommodate different components of the total motion. The 2002 Mw 7.9 Denali strike-slip earthquake, which azimuth varies by more than 50° over the 341 km total rupture length, offers a unique opportunity to look at partitioning in details, thanks to a large seismological dataset. Using a kinematic model that incorporates the obliquity of the plate-motion direction relative to the local fault azimuth, we show that the co-seismic deformation is consistent with the general northwestward displacement of the Wrangell block relative to stable North America. Hence we quantify the efficiency of the Denali fault to accommodate such oblique far field tectonic conditions by defining a coefficient of accommodation Ca, and we evaluate how much remains to be accommodated by distributed deformation off the strike-slip fault. We represent the distributed deformation using strain rosette for a catalog of 735 focal mechanisms between 1987 and 2011. We show that in oblique settings, such as in the Denali case, the aftershocks and the background seismicity are organized to accommodate the deformation that is not localized on the Denali strike-slip fault during the main earthquakes. Actually the westward increase of the obliquity increases the amount of such deformation accommodated through distributed thrust faults, leading to the westward widening of the Alaska Range.\nIn addition we use a simple 2D boundary element elastic model to investigate the difference between geodetic data, showing a rotation of the block south of the fault, and our oblique boundary conditions. We show that it is possible to reproduce the rotation of such block while it is subjected to a northwestward oblique displacement applied on the curved Denali fault system.",

Visuals from \"Star Wars\" to, unfortunately, the recent \"Cosmos\" TV series have firmly established this astronomical misconception. However, even scientifically correct graphics, such as the Minor Planet Center's plot of the inner solar system, reinforces that view. Each pixel in the image is more than a million kilometers in width, making an accurate representation of the object density impossible.\nTo address this widespread misconception, we are investigating an educational exercise built around a computer interactive that we call \"Reverse Asteroids\". In the arcade classic video game, the asteroids came to the player's spaceship. For our reverse implementation, we consider an inquiry-based activity in which the spaceship must go hunting for the asteroids, using a database of real objects in our solar system. Both 3D data visualization and basic statistical analysis play crucial roles in bringing out the true space density within the asteroid belt, and perhaps a reconciliation between imagination and reality. We also emphasize that a partnership of scientists and educators is fundamental to the success of such projects.",

            "abstract": "The data that the MESSENGER probe collected while in cruise phase from Earth to Mercury provide a unique opportunity to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind structures between ~0.3 and 1 AU. While no solar wind plasma data were available from the spacecraft, the heliospheric magnetic field measurements were taken during the cruise phase. We have collected MESSENGER and OMNI data from a number of Carrington rotations between 2008 and 2010 when the probe was in radial conjunction with Earth to minimize the aging of the structure between the observation times at MESSENGER and L1. During these rotations MESSENGER was between ~0.3 and 0.5 AU from Sun. In this presentation we use the high-resolution heliospheric version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model (LFM-helio) driven by the latest generation of Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) coronal solutions. We investigate the radial development of a number of major structures in observations and in our model. We compare the strength of magnetic field compressions as a function of the coronal boundary variables (solar wind speed, density and temperature) and study the complexity of sector boundary crossings at different heliospheric distances. In many cases the crossings become more complex (multiple crossings within a few hours to days) between MESSENGER and L1; in other cases, the crossings are already complex at MESSENGER. In addition, in some cases short periods (a few hours to a day) of predominantly radial field magnetic field are observed. In many of these cases there is a question as to whether the observed structures exist in the corona (and if so whether they are reproduced by WSA) or are produced as the solar wind progresses toward Earth. We attempt to investigate these issues by imposing additional perturbations on top of the WSA coronal solutions, track their evolution and consider whether the observations can be reproduced.",

            "abstract": "Climate and hydrology models are regularly applied to assess potential changes in water resources and to inform adaptation decisions. An increasingly common question is, “What if we are wrong?” While climate models show substantial agreement on metrics such as pressure, temperature, and wind, they are notoriously uncertain in projecting precipitation change. The response to that uncertainty varies depending on the water management context and the nature of the uncertainty. In the southwestern U.S., large storage reservoirs (relative to annual supply) and general expectations of decreasing precipitation have guided extensive discussion on water management towards uncertainties in annual-scale water balances, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. In contrast, smaller reservoirs and little expectation for change in annual precipitation have focused discussions of Pacific Northwest water management toward shifts in runoff seasonality. The relative certainty of temperature impacts on snowpacks compared to the substantial uncertainty in precipitation has yielded a consistent narrative on earlier snowmelt. This narrative has been reinforced by a perception of essentially the same behavior in the historical record. This perception has led to calls in the political arena for more reservoir storage to replace snowpack storage for water supplies. Recent findings on differences in trends in precipitation at high versus low elevations, however, has recalled the uncertainty in precipitation futures and generated questions about alternative water management strategies. An important question with respect to snowpacks is whether the precipitation changes matter in the context of such substantial projections for temperature change. Here we apply an empirical snowpack model to analyze spatial differences in the uncertainty of snowpack responses to temperature and precipitation forcing across the Pacific Northwest U.S. The analysis reveals a strong geographic gradient in uncertainty of snowpack response to future climate, from the coastal regions, where precipitation uncertainty is relatively inconsequential for snowpack changes, to interior mountains where minor uncertainties in precipitation are on par with expected changes relative to temperature.",

            "abstract": "The National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS) was established by the USGS in 2004 in an effort to rescue marine seismic reflection profile data acquired largely by the oil exploration industry throughout the US outer continental shelf (OCS). It features a Web interface for easy on-line geographic search and download. The commercial value of these data had decreased significantly because of drilling moratoria and newer acquisition technology, and large quantities were at risk of disposal. But, the data still had tremendous value for scientific research and education purposes, and an effort was undertaken to ensure that the data were preserved and publicly available.\nMore recently, the USGS and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) have developed a partnership to make similarly available a much larger quantity of 2D and 3D seismic data acquired by the U.S. government for assessment of resources in the OCS. Under Federal regulation, BOEM is required to publicly release all processed geophysical data, including seismic profiles, acquired under an exploration permit, purchased and retained by BOEM, no sooner than 25 years after issuance of the permit. Data acquired prior to 1989 are now eligible for release. Currently these data are distributed on CD or DVD, but data discovery can be tedious. Inclusion of these data within NAMSS vastly increases the amount of seismic data available for research purposes.\nA new NAMSS geographical interface provides easy and intuitive access to the data library. The interface utilizes OpenLayers, Mapnik, and the Django web framework. In addition, metadata capabilities have been greatly increased using a PostgresSQL/PostGIS database incorporating a community-developed ISO-compliant XML template. The NAMSS database currently contains 452 2D seismic surveys comprising 1,645,956 line km and nine 3D seismic surveys covering 9,385 square km. The 2D data holdings consist of stack, migrated and depth sections, most in SEG-Y format.",

            "abstract": "Channel morphology and irregularities in stream boundaries can create zones of flow separation, where lower velocities trap fine sediment and organic matter and increase opportunities for nutrient processing and biological uptake. This effect is most pronounced with channel-spanning structures such as logjams. Humans have changed the spatial and temporal characteristics of wood distribution in streams, with lasting effects on instream wood recruitment, wood loads, logjam distribution, and hydraulic roughness.\nPrevious studies in the Colorado Front Range show that contemporary headwater streams flowing through old-growth, unmanaged forests have more wood than streams flowing through younger-growth, managed forests, but do not evaluate the effects of wood on channel complexity. ‘Managed’ versus ‘unmanaged’ refers to whether forests were or are currently exposed to human alteration. Although some alteration has long since ceased, reduced wood loads in managed streams persist.\nOur primary objective was to quantify differences in logjams, wood volumes, stream complexity, and organic carbon storage on streams with different management and disturbance histories in order to examine legacy effects across a gradient of stream management. Data were collected during the summers of 2013 and 2014 in the Southern Rocky Mountains. The 25 stream reaches studied are 2nd to 3rd order, subalpine streams that are categorized into: old-growth unmanaged forests; younger, naturally disturbed unmanaged forests; and younger managed forests.\nWe assessed instream and floodplain wood loads and logjams and evaluated the role that large wood plays in local channel complexity, pool volume, and storage of organic carbon. Preliminary results show that greatest wood and carbon storage in sediments, as well as channel complexity, occurs in streams in old-growth, unmanaged forests and the least wood and carbon storage and channel complexity occurs in younger-growth, managed forests.",

            "abstract": "In regulated rivers such as the Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) in California, environmental policy requires releasing adequate flows to maintain habitat quality for flora and fauna. The prescribed reservoir releases on the LSJR are tied to water year classifications in order to help satisfy competing water demands in dry years. The question remains as to whether relatively low releases will be adequate to maintain habitat quality for key aquatic species under current and projected climate conditions. This work examines one critical determinant of anadromous fish habitat suitability, water temperature, as a function of reservoir release conditions. More specifically, we study idealized pools subject to the conditions of the LSJR using an established 2D (longitudinal and vertical) flow and heat transport model (CE-QUAL-W2). We assessed the releases in the context of the spring run Chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha) life cycle (the key species in an ongoing restoration effort), focusing on summer holding conditions. Our objective was to determine the conditions under which pools provide sufficiently cool havens for the holding salmon under current and projected climate conditions. Using river bathymetry from measured cross-sections and a high-resolution DEM lidar product, we created a range of ideal pool size representative of LSJR conditions. After calibrating hydraulic and heat transfer parameters using available temperature profiles, we simulated temperature profiles in the pools for scheduled flow releases, at different downstream locations from the reservoir. Results include modeled temperature profiles in holding pools, and derived estimates of suitable holding capacity under a range of pool, releases and climate conditions. Potential engineering modifications are explored as potential mitigation strategies, such as modified flow schedules, riparian shading, pool sizes and pool relocations.",

At least 80 monogenetic volcanic centers compose the BVF, each of which erupted small volumes of magma ranging from basalt to mafic andesite over short intervals of time. More than 140 40Ar/39Ar determinations for lava flows and intrusions in the BVF range in age from ~3100 ka to ~60 ka. Oriented samples for paleomagnetic analysis were collected at an equivalent number of localities (>160) coincident with, or within the same unit proximal to, the geochronologic sampling sites. Based on the frequency distribution of ages, the most significant episodes of Boring volcanism occurred between 2700 and 2200 ka, 1700 and 500 ka, and 350 and 60 ka. A systematic determination of the BVF’s eruptive history was undertaken mainly to assess its anomalous neotectonic setting west of the Cascade arc axis, as well as the magnitude of its concomitant volcanic hazards within the greater Portland and Vancouver metropolitan areas. Our paleomagnetic and geochronologic data, however, also have significant implications for the timing of geomagnetic field reversals and excursions during the Late Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. The BVF data are more numerous higher in the section, and they capture transitional fields at two polarity boundaries allowing precise age determinations to be made for these reversals: the Brunhes-Matuyama transition is thus dated at 773±5 ka, and the upper Jaramillo-Matuyama transition at 973±6 ka. The lower Jaramillo-Matuyama transition occurred prior to 1068±8 ka, and the normal Cobb subchron must have occurred between reversed-polarity Matuyama flows dated at 1159±14 ka and 1207±6 ka. The lower Olduvai-Matuyama transition occurred prior to 1927±4 ka, and the Matuyama-Gauss transition prior to 2616±18 ka. In addition, our data indicate that boundaries of the reversed Kaena subchron occurred between 3105±41 ka and 3088±9 ka (lower) and after 3055±29 ka (upper).",

            "abstract": "Beginning shortly after the launch of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in late 1997, an increased emphasis was placed upon the development and evaluation of multi-satellite or “blended” techniques, that attempted to marry the best features of the precipitation estimates from the multiple, intermittently spaced passive (or active) microwave sensors, with the fine spatial and temporal sampling provided by the global operational geostationary imagers. These collective efforts have largely converged to the “motion-based” methodologies inherent in the designs of the current Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) merged product (IMERG) and the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) produced by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA. At their core, the performance of the multi-satellite techniques hinges upon the quality of the input precipitation data that is inherited from the various passive microwave (PMW) radiometers, such as the TRMM Microwave Imager, and the most recent GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). Typically, the radiometrically warm land surface background and its highly variable surface characteristics have limited the use of these sensors to the higher-frequency channels, which perform poorly for lighter rainfall and over complex, cold surfaces. This has limited the use of these data for hydrological modeling in watersheds where much of the streamflow originates from runoff of cold-season precipitation and snow. In this presentation, we will discuss some of the more recent changes to satellite-based precipitation techniques to account for land surface properties, including techniques that have been (or are under consideration for) the GPM over-land precipitation products.",

            "abstract": "The co-occurrence of brittle and ductile deformation underlies many large-scale tectonic processes, geodetically and seismologically monitored strain transients, and even several applied geoscience problems in hydrocarbon production and CO2 sequestration. Evidence for such mixed-deformation is preserved in the rock record, such as in mid-crustal shear zones where, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions, some mineral phases undergo brittle and others ductile deformation during the same overall bulk deformation.\nHere we combine physical experiments with an analytical approach to investigate the impact of the semi-brittle material on the deformation localization and on stick-slip and creep events. Two sets of experiments are performed: 1) shear of a mixture of elastic-frictional grains within a viscously deforming media, and 2) propagation of wetted fractures in a visco-elasto-plastic interlinked polymer gel during shear. We measure the force and displacement while imaging the shear cell. In both cases the rock analogues show a semi-brittle behavior where the deformation localization is enhanced and slip events get damped leading to creep. Several parameters were then extracted from the experiments and directly used as input parameters in an analytical solution for semi-brittle flow. In the analytical model localization and slip is modeled as a damped oscillator mimicking the behavior of discrete fractures originating in a strong material that get viscously damped in a surrounding continuous weaker material. That the measured and calculated decay times of slip events lead to comparable results is supportive of the models physical premise. This study suggest that in a mixed brittle-ductile system, localization can be efficient, frictional responses can be dampened but still present, and basic rheological descriptions may apply, all of which has implications for understanding strain transients and coseismic release.",

This includes a land surface model fully coupled to a river routing model and generic water management model applicable globally at 1/2o resolution and regionally at 1/8o resolution. A global integrated assessment model and its regionalized version for the U.S. are used to simulate water demand consistent with the energy technology and socio-economics scenarios. Human influence on the hydrologic cycle includes regulation and storage, consumptive use and overall redistribution of water resources in space and time. As groundwater provides an important source of water supply for irrigation and other uses worldwide, the integrated modeling framework has been extended to represent groundwater as an additional supply source, and to account for the return flow generated from the groundwater and surface water withdrawals.\nIn this presentation, we evaluate the groundwater supply and return flow modules by analyzing the simulated regulated flow, reservoir storage and supply deficit for irrigation and non irrigation sectors over major hydrologic regions of the conterminous U.S. The modeling framework is then used to provide insights on the resilience of future water resources in the U.S. ensured specifically by the return flow and groundwater dependence.",

            "abstract": "In the giant impact hypothesis, the Moon accretes from a disk around the proto-Earth. In the canonical model, the impact also sets the present-day angular momentum (AM). Alternatively, the Moon may form via a high AM giant impact and the present-day AM was established by a lunar orbital resonance.\nHere we examine the dynamics of disks formed by high AM impacts. Initially, the Earth’s extended atmosphere and the inner region of the rotationally-supported disk do not intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary and form a continuous vapor. The atmosphere has a higher angular velocity than the partially pressure-supported disk; as a result, shear instabilities lead to mixing between the atmosphere and disk and net transfer of AM from the planet to the disk. The pressure-supported atmosphere’s continuity with the inner disk limits the accretion rate onto the planet, even when the planet’s rotation rate is below the spin stability limit.\nWhile the inner disk remains vapor, the disk’s surface cools radiatively. In the outer disk, droplets settle to the midplane and form moonlets via gravitational instabilities. We find that the potential energy reduction of the system by lunar accretion is primarily converted to heating the inner disk and atmosphere. Moonlets in the outer disk are not heated sufficiently to vaporize. Because net accretion onto the planet is limited, droplet formation in the outer disk is resupplied by pressure gradients between the inner and outer disk.\nIn the canonical case, the atmosphere and disk intersect the liquid-vapor boundary and do not form a continuous fluid. Also, the planet has a lower angular velocity than the disk. Then, condensates from the disk may fall freely to Earth. Thus, compared to the canonical model, high AM disks have enhanced lunar accretion efficiency. Furthermore, if mixing between the atmosphere and inner disk is efficient, then a wide range of high AM giant impacts may produce the isotopic similarity between the Earth and Moon.",

            "abstract": "In November 2013, a series of earthquakes began along a mapped ancient fault system near Azle, Texas. The Azle events are the third felt earthquake sequence in the Fort Worth (Barnett Shale) Basin since 2008, and several production and injection wells in the area are drilled to depths near the recent seismic activity. Understanding if and/or how injection and removal of fluids in the crystalline crust reactivates faults have important implications for seismology, the energy industry, and society. We assessed whether the Azle earthquakes were induced using a joint analysis of the earthquake data, subsurface geology and fault structure, and 3D pore pressure modeling. Using a 12-station temporary seismic deployment, we have recorded and located >300 events large enough to be recorded on multiple stations and 1000s of events during periods of swarm activity. High-resolution locations and focal mechanisms indicate that events occurred on NE-SW trending, steeply dipping normal faults associated with the southern end of the Newark East Fault Zone with hypocenters between 2-8 km depth. We considered multiple causes that might have changed stress along this system. Earthquakes resulting from natural processes, though perhaps unlikely in this historically inactive region, can be neither ruled out nor confirmed due to lack of information on the natural stress state of these faults. Analysis of lake and groundwater variations near Azle showed that no significant stress changes occurred prior to or during the earthquake sequence. In contrast, analysis of pore-pressure models shows that the combination of formation water production and wastewater injection near the fault could have caused pressure increases that induced earthquakes on near-critically stressed faults.",

            "abstract": "Eastern North America is an excellent region to test hypotheses about the evolution through time of tectonic processes, the growth of continental crust and the assembly of continents. Over a spatial scale of just a few hundred kilometres, the surface geology records almost 3 billion years of Earth history, with a transition from the Archean Superior craton through the Proterozoic Grenville orogenic belt to the Phanerozoic Appalachian terranes and the edge of the North American continent.\nThe boundaries between these major tectonic provinces have been mapped at the surface, and crustal-scale geophysical studies (e.g. LITHOPROBE) have been able to trace their complex signatures to the Moho and below in some parts of eastern Canada. Nevertheless, the nature of the boundaries across the region, and their continuation into the lithospheric mantle, remains enigmatic. The high wavespeed lithospheric keel of the Canadian Shield extends beneath the Proterozoic terranes; however it is still unclear whether this material represents a continuation of Archean lithosphere over which the Grenville terranes have been thrust, or whether the Grenville can be associated with its own thick keel. The transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic lithosphere beneath the Appalachian Front is likewise ambiguous.\nTo shed new light on the tectonic evolution of the region, and the nature of the major tectonic boundaries, a broadband seismograph network was installed in eastern Canada in 2012-2013 through the QM-III (Quebec-Maine Across Three Sutures) experiment; stations will remain in place for 2-3 years. The network consists of a dense NW-SE profile from the southern tip of Hudson Bay to coastal Maine, supplemented by existing more sparsely-distributed stations, and a 2D deployment across Maritime Canada.\nData acquisition is ongoing, but preliminary results from receiver function analysis, travel-time tomography and surface-wave dispersion are already showing some intriguing variations in structure across the region. Here we present an overview of the experiment, our initial analyses and our long-term goals.",

            "abstract": "The link between climate variability and change, especially extreme conditions, is well documented in both environmental and health literature. The focus of research in the recent past, and current studies, is to understand causal relationships between the disease agents and environmental conditions, based on post-hoc analysis of observed cases to develop predictive models for advance warning of public by health authorities. A combination of the isolated examination of individual diseases and routes of infection (e.g. respiratory system, skin, digestive tract, etc.) and reliance mostly on correlative evidence from past occurrences have restricted public health progress (e.g. compared to experimental evidence of the quantitative balance of different transmission routes) and the utility of knowledge gained from such studies (e.g. reliably predicting seasonal outbreaks is no longer an advance). We propose a shift from focusing on the prediction of individual disease pattern(s) to a more holistic identification and mitigation of broader vulnerabilities within the provision of public health. Such an approach has the potential to account for and reveal health vulnerabilities common to a broader range of health stresses, thus facilitating a more holistic response to health challenges. The human health fragilities associated with respiratory diseases caused by a combination of natural (i.e dust, pollen, etc.) and industrial particulates (i.e. soot, aerosols, etc.) and other infectious airborne agents, for example, and their adverse impact on human health such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, etc. is an ideal candidate for such a holistic approach to environment and health research.",

            "abstract": "River avulsions – abrupt relocation of a river channel – are a primary mechanism by which deltas grow and field evidence suggests that backwater hydrodynamics play an important role in setting the location of avulsions on deltas; however, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of backwater-mediated avulsions. Here we use physical experiments to unravel the mechanics of river avulsions caused by backwater hydrodynamics where low water discharges cause flow deceleration and sediment deposition and high water discharges result in flow acceleration and erosion in the lowest reaches of alluvial river near its shoreline, i.e., the backwater zone. We performed two experiments in the river-ocean facility at Caltech, where a 7 cm wide, 7 m long alluvial river feeds into a 6 m by 3 m “ocean” basin, building its own delta under subcritical flow and constant sea level conditions. The first experiment was conducted under constant sediment and water discharge, where backwater hydrodynamics are muted, while in the second experiment, we alternated between a low flow and high flow such that the erosion caused by the high flow is not balanced by the deposition caused by the low flow in the backwater zone, thus, allowing for the persistence of backwater hydrodynamics. In the first experiment, avulsions occur at the imposed change in flow confinement and are driven by a loss in sediment transport capacity, which are akin to avulsions near a canyon-fan transition on alluvial fans. In the second experiment, however, avulsions occur further downstream of the imposed change in flow confinement, and the avulsion length (distance of the avulsion location from the shoreline) scales with the backwater length. Thus, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that backwater hydrodynamics exert a primary control on avulsion location thereby setting the delta-lobe size. Further, we document key differences in development of shoreline rugosity, channel migration and avulsion frequency between the two experimental deltas.",

            "abstract": "Páramo ecosystems are widely recognized for their high water regulation capacity and as the main source of runoff generation in the Andean region. Understanding the hydrological functioning of the fragile wet Andean páramo ecosystems is critical in the mountainous regions of South America given their high susceptibility to global and local stressors such as land use change and climate change and variability . Despite this, most of the basins in the Andean mountain range are still ungauged, resulting in a currently hindered hydrologic analysis of the water sources contributing to runoff generation in the high-elevation páramo ecosystems. To improve this situation and provide a baseline for future tracer-based hydrologic studies, the isotopic signature of water samples collected within the Zhurucay River experimental basin (7.53 km2) was analyzed. The study area is located in the southern Ecuador and stretches over an altitudinal range of 3200 and 3900 m a.s.l. Water samples in rainfall, streamflow, and soils were collected between May 2011 and May 2013. Streamflow hydrometric and isotopic information within the study site was collected using a nested monitoring system. The main soils in the study site are the Andosols mainly located in the steep slopes, and the Histosols (Andean páramo wetlands) predominantly located at the bottom of the valley. Results reveal that the Andosols drain the infiltrated rainfall water to the Histosols. The Histosols on their turn feed creeks and small rivers. Pre-event water stored in the Histosols is the primary source of runoff generation throughout the year. Defining the water sources contributing to runoff generation is the first step towards the establishment of scientifically-based programs of management and conservation of water resources in the Andean region; and the monitoring of isotopic information has proven useful to improve the understanding of the ecosystem’s hydrologic behavior.",

            "abstract": "Waveform cross correlation, or template matching as it is sometimes called, has long been known to be an effective method for finding occurrences of a known repeating signal within a waveform. Because seismic signals are rarely known a priori, waveform cross correlation is not often used as a detection method for seismic networks. However, past studies (e.g. Gibbons and Ringdal, 2006) have shown that cross correlation can be effective in identifying events with similar locations and focal mechanisms (and thus waveforms) to a pre-existing template. Because induced seismicity often satisfies these requirements the method is well-suited to induced seismicity monitoring. We apply the method of waveform cross correlation to a sequence of events between Nov. 29, 2013 and Dec. 13, 2013 occurring at Crooked Lake near Fox Creek, Alberta. These events are believed to be attributable to injection activities in the area. A total of 24 events were detected using traditional STA/LTA triggering methods. The largest event, measured at local magnitude 3.9, is used as a template to identify other events. We compare the effectiveness of the traditional STA/LTA detection method to the cross correlation technique. With a modest correlation threshold we identify all 24 of the original events and an additional 89 new events for a total of 113 events identified by waveform cross correlation. We estimate the magnitude of completeness using the maximum curvature method (Wiemer and Wyss, 2000) and compare the result for the STA/LTA catalogue and the cross correlation catalogue. We find that the magnitude of completeness is about 0.8 magnitude units lower for the cross correlation catalogue. We explore the possibility of determining a probability density function to describe the values of observed correlation between a template and a seismic signal and reconcile theoretical expectations with empirical data. We further suggest a trigger threshold for cross correlation detection algorithms based on the probability density function. Finally, we discuss the practicality of implementing waveform cross correlation detection methods to monitor induced seismicity.",

The fractal scaling exponents (τ), the slopes of the log-log relation between soil moisture moments and scales, have the potential to predict the parameters for soil moisture distribution at higher grid-resolution. We demonstrate here that the magnitude and temporal development of τ is related to basin water storage, seasonal mode of wetting and drying, and topography. We used PAWS + CLM, a physically-based surface-subsurface process model, to explore soil moisture spatial and temporal fractal patterns by running several scenarios in two Midwest basins of the United States. We applied homogenous meteorological forcing to focus on the control from heterogeneity of watershed static properties and examined the temporal evolution of τ in different soil depths and in non-freezing days. We found that τ in the top 10cm layer is approximately linearly related to basin-average water storage. In non-freezing seasons, τ shows strong hysteretic patterns. Wetting and drying dominated processes weakens previous organization, and reorganization process is linked to the hydrologic characteristics of the basin. We explained the difference between the seasonal and event dynamic of the fractal exponents.",

To investigate the cycling of lithogenic particles in the central North Pacific Ocean, surface and vertical profile samples of marine suspended particulate matter (SPM) were collected July-August 2012 during the HOE-DYLAN cruises at Station ALOHA. In the late summer, atmospheric dust inputs from the Gobi desert (which peak during the spring, April-May) were sparse, as indicated by low surface particulate Ti (pTi) concentrations. In contrast, surface pAl concentrations did not follow pTi trends as expected, but appear to be dominated by scavenging/uptake of dissolved Al during diatom blooms. Surface pMn concentrations were low, but vertical profiles of pMn and pMn/pTi reveal a strong sedimentary source at 200 m, originating from the Hawaiian continental shelf through a combination of redox mobilization and resuspension processes. The redox active elements Ce and Co can have chemistries similar to that of Mn, but in these samples the pCe and pCo distributions were distinct from Mn and each other in both surface trends and vertical profiles. Surface pREE (e.g., La, Ce, Pr) were highest during the earliest sampling events and quickly decreased to consistently low concentrations, while vertical distributions were characterized by scavenging onto biotic particles and mid-depth inputs. The surface particulate Co trend is similar to those of pAl and pP, while the pCo vertical profiles reflect surface enrichment but low concentrations and little variability at depth.\nA second, complementary poster is also being presented which examines the biological influence over particulate trace element cycling (Weisend et al., \"Particulate Trace Element Cycling in a Diatom Bloom at Station ALOHA\").",

Daily surface SPM samples were examined for evidence of atmospheric deposition and biological uptake, while five vertical profiles were examined for evidence of surface vertical export and subsurface horizontal transport from nearby sources (e.g., margin sediments, hydrothermal plumes). Maxima in surface particulate P (a biological tracer) corresponded with a diatom bloom, and surprisingly also coincided with maxima in particulate Al (typically a tracer for lithogenic inputs). The surface particulate Al distributions likely result from the adsorption of dissolved Al onto diatom silica frustules, not from atmospheric dust deposition. In addition, a subsurface maximum in particulate Al and P was observed four days later at 75m, possibly resulting from vertical export of the surface diatom bloom. The distributions of other bioactive trace elements (e.g. Cd, Co, Cu) will be presented in the context of the diatom bloom and other biological, chemical and physical features.\nA second, complementary poster is also being presented which examines the cycling of trace elements in lithogenic particles (Morton et al., \"Trace Element Cycling in Lithogenic Particles at Station ALOHA\").",

Magnetic reconnection signatures accompany them. Satellite-drag/density enhancements of 20-100% are commonly seen by CHAMP (Luhr et al, 2004). We calculate these to correspond to transient energy deposition rates at the feet of freshly reconnected open flux tubes, equaling 5-30 times solar EUV rates above 150 km altitude. That these density enhancements are observed all seasons, darkness or sunlight, IMF north or south (Kervalishvili and Luhr, 2013), is powerful evidence for ubiquitous and substantial dayside polar cap energy injection. Frictional drag heating is closest to the physical cause (Strangeway, 2011); we find response times ~ ¼ hour above 200 km. Altitude is key, Poynting flux measurements without coincident electron density profiles, can yield order of magnitude energy deposition rate errors (Richmond, 2010, Carlson et al, 2012).",

            "abstract": "In this experimental study, we investigated the influence of solution chemistry on the boron abundance in synthetic calcite using a pH-stat system. We systematically varied solution pH as well as the concentration of total dissolved boron (BT), inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium ion. We found robust positive correlations between boron abundance in calcite (measured as the boron to calcium ratio, B/Ca) and solution pH, [BT], [DIC] as well as [Ca2+], when a given parameter was solely manipulated while keeping the others constant. Except for [BT], raising these parameters also caused simultaneous increase in calcite saturation and precipitation rate. We found that much of the B/Ca variability as a results of the chemical manipulations tested here can be essentially explained by just precipitation rate and the [BT]/[DIC] ratio in the solution, which was particularly the case for relatively rapidly precipitated calcite samples. On the contrary, for relatively slowly precipitated samples, the [B(OH)4-]/[DIC] and [BT]/[DIC] ratios are equally effective in explaining the B/Ca variability (along with precipitation rate). This observation suggests the possibility of a hitherto unrecognized and apparently kinetically-controlled mechanism that promotes B(OH)3 incorporation for rapidly forming calcite.\nIn recent years both the abundance and isotopic composition of boron in marine biogenic CaCO3 (B/Ca and δ11B, respectively) has been increasingly utilized to constrain past ocean carbonate chemistry. But these boron-based proxies crucially rely on the first order assumption that B(OH)4- is predominantly incorporated. Thus, the possibility of kinetically-controlled B(OH)3 incorporation presented here raises a concern for the reliability of the B/Ca and δ11B proxy. If it is similarly applicable to foraminifers, shell B/Ca and δ11B may be prone to significant uncertainties due to long-term changes in seawater chemistry. Our results further suggest that future calibrations of these proxies clearly need to take calcification rates into consideration.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission objectives are to quantify polar ice sheet contributions to sea level change, quantify regional signatures of ice sheet changes to assess driving mechanisms, estimate sea ice thickness, and to enable measurements of canopy height as a basis for estimating large-scale biomass. Its predecessor ICESat, which operated from 2003 to 2009, pioneered the use of laser altimeters in space to study the elevation of the Earth’s surface and its changes. Among other contributions to the cryospheric sciences, ICESat proved adept at making centimeter-level elevation measurements over both ice sheets and sea ice. Since ICESat stopped collecting data in October 2009, the IceBridge and CryoSat-2 missions continue these important observations. The well-documented and ongoing dramatic and rapid changes in the Earth’s ice cover have strengthened the need for sustained observations beyond what CryoSat-2 and IceBridge are expected to provide. Lessons learned from ICESat are the need for cross-track slope information (realized through ICESat-2’s multiple beams), a smaller footprint size, and gapless along-track data collection. These needs resulted in a different measurement concept for ICESat-2.\nThe talk will provide a brief summary of the measurement concept, the status of hardware development (instrument Integration and Testing has started in May 2014), and progress on geophysical algorithm development.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation applications require characterization of the errors in the products being assimilated. When true data are not available to explicitly compute these errors, triple collocation (TC) provides a methodology to estimate the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) and correlations by combining three simultaneous co-located estimates. Triple collocation assumes that for each of the three products, the errors are independent of each other. In many cases, however, one may expect correlations between errors to be significant. Among others, they are likely to occur when there is a representativeness error between some of the products (e.g. if one of the products is based on in situ measurements) or if two out of the three products have a similar source – for example both coming from microwave remote sensing estimates or both originating in land surface models. Indeed, previous studies have shown that this assumption can induce significant inaccuracies in the error estimates. For classical TC, the assumption is needed for the system to be fully determined - only six independent equations are available for estimating 6 unknowns: 3 scale parameters and 3 error variances (i.e. RMSEs). In this presentation, we propose obtaining additional information from the triplet of observations by using errors-in-variables-based regressions between pairs of noisy observations to estimate the scale parameters. The introduction of additional equations allows for the derivation of additional unknowns, such that non-zero correlations between the errors of the different products can be derived. This significantly increases the accuracy of the estimated errors compared to classical triple collocation, as will be shown using both simulation studies with known errors and an application to soil moisture data.",

            "abstract": "As Terra marks its 15th anniversary, the Students’ Cloud Observations On-Line (S’COOL) Project celebrates an 18 year milestone. S’COOL is the education and public outreach arm of the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project, which has two instruments on Terra. It developed from an initial conversation between scientists and educators in December 1996 before the launch of the first CERES instrument on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Since January 1997, S’COOL has engaged students and citizen scientists with this NASA research by inviting them to make ground truth observations of clouds and related Earth system parameters.\nSince the project began, more than 127,000 cloud observations have been reported from more than 70 countries around the world. While observations are accepted at any time, more than half of those reported correspond to a CERES satellite retrieval matched in time (+/-15 minutes) and space. Nearly 1% of the reports, from locations at higher latitudes, can be compared to both Terra and Aqua to shed light on view angle effects. More than 3% of observations are for Terra night-time overpasses. About 10% of reports are for locations with snow on the ground – an ongoing challenge for cloud detection from space.\nS’COOL draws very loyal and unique participants: a school in Pennsylvania alone has reported more than 11,000 observations (including more than 2,500 night-time reports for Terra). In Central and South America, 3 schools in Colombia and one in Nicaragua have each reported more than 2,500 observations. The addition of the S’COOL Rover program, added in 2007 to simplify participation for citizen scientists, enabled reports from the Around the Americas sailing ship that circumnavigated North and South America in 2009-10, Roz Savage, a UK woman who has rowed solo across all the world’s oceans, and a few observations from the MAGIC campaign of instrumented cargo ships transiting from Long Beach to Hawaii. A middle school in Connecticut is credited with more than 2,500 observations, including a large number made from the students’ homes, which provides dense spatial sampling at certain time periods.\nThis poster will update and summarize the achievements of the first 18 years of this project, and share some lessons learned through its operation.",

            "abstract": "The diurnal cycle is a fundamental mode of tropical rainfall variability, and its accurate portrayal remains a challenging issue for numerical weather and climate prediction. The purpose of this study is to better understand the diurnal cycle of warm season (June-September) rainfall over West Africa and its underlying physical processes. We use rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and atmospheric dynamics fields from reanalyses to explore the rainfall diurnal cycle in the climatology (1998-2013) and a case study of 2006. In addition, a simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at a convection-permitting resolution of 3 km resolution is analyzed to evaluate the model’s ability to capture the rainfall diurnal cycle in the warm season of 2006.\nThe rainfall in the warm season of 2006 shows a mixture of afternoon and nocturnal peaks over West Africa, which is similar to the climatology. Further examination of the 2006 case is focused on three domains: (1) the AF domain (3°W-0°W, 9°N-11.5°N) with late afternoon peaks (2) the SN domain (2°E-5°E, 9°N-11.5°N) with nocturnal peaks, and (3) the NN domain (2°E-5°E, 13.5°N-16.5°N) with nocturnal peaks. For each domain, the rainfall diurnal cycle is more related to the diurnal cycle of rainfall frequency than of the intensity, and it is largely shaped by the diurnal cycle of the frequency of extreme rainfall events. The afternoon rainfall peaks over the AF domain are associated with unstable atmospheric profiles below 850 hPa. The nocturnal rainfall peaks over the NN and SN domains are associated with westward-propagating rainfall systems initiated on the previous afternoon around the complex topography to the east (about 5-15°E).\nThe rainfall produced by the convection-permitting simulation shows similar westward-propagating features. The model realistically captures the nocturnal rainfall peaks over the SN domain, because it reproduces the westward-propagating rainfall systems originated from the Jos Plateau located just east of the domain. However, the model fails to simulate the rainfall peaks over the northern part of the NN domain due to a dry bias, and over the AF domain due to an overestimation of nocturnal peaks.",

As an altimeter, the quantity of light removed from a laser beam by scattering or absorption during the roundtrip to the surface may be calculated knowing the energy returned, the surface geometric albedo and the instrument parameters for each laser shot. These opacity measurements indicate the combined effects of dust and condensates, particularly those seen during during the night. The measure of opacity, to optical depths exceeding unity, correlates well with daytime measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope and with the broadband Thermal Emission Spectrometer. Applying a simple phase function to passive radiometric observations obtained at emission angles varying from 0 to 80 degrees, upper and lower limits are obtained for atmospheric opacity as a function of season and time of day. The implications for the effects of nocturnal water ice clouds on radiative transfer, and for future applications to the detection of icy plumes from moons of the outer solar system will be discussed.",

The Global Rivers Observatory is advancing our understanding of how climate change, deforestation, and other disturbances are impacting river chemistry and land-ocean linkages. This knowledge is vital for tracking the health of Earth’s watersheds and predicting how Earth’s water and chemical cycles will change in the future. The Global Rivers Observatory also promotes the communication of science to the general public. In September 2013, the My River My Home art and science exhibit opened at the Fraser River Discovery Centre, New Westminster, BC. The exhibit is a global exchange of artwork created by children living along the rivers being studied by the Global Rivers Observatory scientists. The exhibit is intended to inspire young students to develop an awareness of the environment and the importance of rivers. Scientists from UFV, WHOI, and WHRC worked together with the Fraser River Discovery Centre on the science communication aspects of the display and to develop hands-on science activities looking at different aspects of river water quality. The exhibition has led to the creation of My River My Home, An Activity Kit for Educators about the sustainability of the Fraser River. The kit is being offered through the Fraser River Discovery Centre and deals with issues such as the importance of water, water quality, and encouraging a global perspective. The resource kit was classroom tested by several teachers, and four UBC teacher candidates worked on incorporating teacher suggestions into the kit. The resource kit will be available on-line at the end of September 2014 and contains inquiry based activities suitable for a variety of educational levels.",

Particularly, earth directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of the most extreme geomagnetic storms in the near-Earth space environment. On 23 July 2012, NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) spacecraft observed in situ an extremely fast CME that traveled 0.96 astronomical units (~1 AU) in about 19 h. In our study, we use the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), a 3-D MHD based code, to perform simulations of this rare CME by considering STEREO-A in situ observations to represent the upstream L1 solar wind boundary conditions. The goal of the study is to investigate what would have happened if this Rare-type CME was Earth-bound. Global SWMF-generated ground geomagnetic field perturbations are used to compute the simulated induced geoelectric field at specific ground-based active magnetometer sites. Simulation results show that the July 23 CME would have produced ground effects comparable to previously observed extreme geomagnetic storms such as the Halloween 2003 storm.

Most research has focused upon circum-neutral pH environments, such as freshwater lake and aquifer sediments, and extreme environments like hot springs and hypersaline soda lakes have also been well investigated. In contrast, little work has been conducted on acidic environments. The azure-hued, clear waters of the Herman Pit are acidic (pH 2-4), and overlie oxidized sediments that have a distinctive red/orange coloration indicative of the presence of ferrihydrites and other Fe(III) minerals. There is extensive ebullitive release of geothermal gases from the lake bottom in the form of numerous continuous-flow seeps which are composed primarily of mixtures of CO2, CH4, and H2S. We collected near-shore surface sediments with an Eckman grab, and stored the “soupy” material in filled mason jars kept at 4˚C. Initial experiments were conducted using 3:1 mixtures of lake water: sediment so as to generate dilute slurries which were amended with mM levels of electron acceptors (arsenate, nitrate, oxygen), electron donors (arsenite, acetate, lactate, hydrogen), and incubated under N2, air, or H2. Owing to the large adsorptive capacity of the Fe(III)-rich slurries, we were unable to detect As(V) or As(III) in the aqueous phase of either live or autoclaved controls, although the former consumed lactate, acetate, nitrate, or hydrogen, while the latter did not. This prompted us to conduct a series of further diluted slurry experiments using the live materials from the first as a 10 % addition to lakewater. In these experiments we observed reduction of As(V) to As(III) in anoxic slurries and that rates were enhanced by addition of electron donors (H2, acetate, or lactate). We also observed oxidation of As(III) to As(V) in oxic slurries and in anoxic slurries amended with nitrate. These results indicate the presence of a viable microbial As(V)/As(III) redox cycle in the sediments of this extreme environment. Further investigations using culture-independent protocols to identify participant prokaryotes and their functional arsenic genes (e.g., aioA, arrA, arxA) are underway at this time.",

            "abstract": "Ultra-low frequency anomalies in the magnetic and electric fields have been reported prior to several earthquakes. Because most prominent ULFEM anomalies have thus far only been observed on individual stations, some authors have argued that some of these anomalies have an instrumental cause, rather than being earthquake precursors.\nTwo independent ULFEM networks are presently operating in the greater San Francisco Bay Area; one managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Stanford University and the other by QuakeFinder (QF).The case that these anomalies are not instrumental would be strengthened by a demonstration that identical anomalies are seen on the two networks, despite their different components (magnetometers, digitizers and telemetry). A detailed comparison of the two systems will allow data from each of the two networks to be used to confirm anomalies and to evaluate potential precursor signals.\nTo provide this comparison, the USGS-Stanford and QF acquired data on two independent ULFEM systems at the USGS-Stanford ULFEM station located at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, CA, from March 31–May 13, 2014. The two systems were set up~50m from each other and away from potential sources of noise. Both systems recorded the magnetic field with induction coils oriented along the three cardinal directions aligned with magnetic north.\nThe results of this experiment reveal that the two systems have very similar response functions and comparable noise and drift characteristics. Both complex “noise” (a, b) and single discrete pulses (c, d) were recorded with essentially identical characteristics by the two systems. We also found, in a few instances, where the signals were observed on one system but were absent on the other, clearly indicating either internal system noise or reflecting extremely local site phenomena affecting a single system.\nFuture efforts will involve analyses of pulses, spectral characteristics, correlation coefficients and noise.",

            "abstract": "South East Asia is one of the fastest developing regions on Earth and has experienced a recent large increase in atmospheric pollution. Glaciers of the nearby Himalayan mountains represent a unique archive that provides the potential to be used to determine the strength and timing of the onset of anthropogenic atmospheric pollution in the region.\nWithin the Third Pole Project several ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalaya are analyzed for their trace element concentrations. Here we present results of a new trace element record from the Dasuopu ice core spanning 1790 - 1993 AD. The Dasuopu ice core was drilled in 1997 at 7200 m altitude in the Himalaya and provides the highest elevation ice core record ever obtained. Due to the high altitude this site has the potential to archive not only contamination records of regional significance, but possibly also long distant pollution from, for example, Europe and climatic signals influenced by the North Atlantic. This area is heavily influenced by the monsoon regime providing seasonally and highly variable snow accumulation rates.\nThe upper 50 m of the core covering the time interval from 1950 to 1997 consist of Firn and is sampled non-continuously in a resolution of approximately one sample/year. The time interval between 1790 and 1950 is presented by a continuous record in subannual resolution. Crustal enrichment factors are used to discriminate between the terrigenous and the anthropogenic contributions. In this study we focus two research topics: (1) determine the onset of the earliest anthropogenic contamination from trace elements at this elevation (7200 m) Himalayan site and (2) determine intra-annual variations of atmospheric trace elements, with a focus on discriminating between pre-monsoon season (when the aerosol input is governed by the high dust input in spring) and the monsoon and dry season.\nWe find trace element concentrations to be very low and very variable throughout the year with concentration changes of up to 2-3 orders of magnitude (e.g. Pb concentrations range from 0.1 ppt to 1000 ppt). Average concentration levels are comparable to those recorded at some polar sites. We find an increase in elements of crustal origin in the second half of the 20th century.",

            "abstract": "In the framework of the Corinth Rift Laboratory, the seismic activity in the western part of the rift is monitored since 2000 by a network of 15 three-component stations (CRLNET). It is characterized by several instrumental and historical large earthquakes with magnitude larger than 5.5, and numerous active swarms. More than 12 years of seismicity (about 100,000 events) that covers seven orders of magnitude of seismic moment Mo (1010 – 1017 Nm) is available. The detailed analysis of the whole seismicity brings insights into the geometry of faults at depth, the nature and the structure of the active zone at 6-8 km depth previously interpreted as a possible detachment, and more generally into the rifting process and mechanical processes at various space-time scales. For this purpose, we identified multiplets and precisely relocated the seismicity using double difference techniques. The seismicity exhibits a complex structure, strongly varying along the rift axis. We will present some specific structures of the seismicity and swarms. The spatio-temporal evolution of earthquake sequences, which repeatedly occur in specific sub-areas of the fault segments, and the relationship with the distribution of the elastic/anelastic structure, the VP/VS ratio and physical properties of the micro-earthquakes (such as seismic moment, static stress-drop, corner frequency and source size) provide important insights on the presence and the role of fluids during the generation of fractures. The variability of the stress release would suggest, in fact, the presence of heterogeneities in the friction distribution and fluid pressure, and normal stress and elastic properties variability in the fault zone. Finally, according with seismic and geodetic observations, we proposed a new mechanical model for the rifting process in this region, implying a non-elastic, mostly aseismic uniform NS opening below the rift axis, coupled with the downwards growth of a yet unmature detachment.",

In contrast, the West North China Craton (WNCC), which is largely composed of the Ordos Block, has maintained its stability as a cratonic block.\nOrdos, as expected for a craton, has a much thicker lithosphere (~200 km) than ENCC (~80 km), and traditional receiver functions (RF) suggested average crustal thickness of ~40 km beneath Ordos, albeit 10 km thicker than the ~30km beneath the ENCC. In contrast, VDSS applied to an E-W linear Peking University seismic array across middle Ordos (latitude 37.5°N) found the Moho much deeper at ~60 km (Yu et al., EPSL, 2012). To better understand the lithospheric structure of Ordos, we applied VDSS to two E-W linear Chinese Academy of Sciences arrays across north (39.5°N) and south (36°N) Ordos. We applied wave mode-separation and deconvolution techniques that significantly removed the influence of the source wavelet and improved the resolution in VDSS. We show that beneath the southern array the Moho (from VDSS) is generally flat within Ordos at ~51 km, but rapidly shallows eastward to ~28 km from 110.5°E to 112.5°E, very similar to the Moho shape of the middle profile. The rapid change in Moho depth on the two profiles may be due to the influence of the Shanxi Graben from 36°N to 37.5°N. Beneath the northern array a continuously west-dipping Moho is found from ~26 km at 112°E to ~45km at 107.5°E. Our VDSS result for both the southern and northern arrays is clearly different from the conventional RF results given by Zheng et al. (JGR, 2012), which show an almost flat Moho at ~40 km with a trough at 110.5°E beneath the northern array and a Moho gently dipping westward from ~30 km at 114°E to ~40 km at 108°E beneath the southern array.\nThe Moho found by RF is the interface with the largest S velocity contrast within the lithosphere, whereas the Moho found by VDSS is the boundary causing total reflection of down-going P Wave. While it is not surprising that RF and VDSS identify different interfaces in the crust-mantle transition zone, their large separation is unusual and implies a complex crust-mantle transition zone structure beneath Ordos that might shed light on the evolution of the NCC.",

Earthdata Search is a web application which combines modern browser features with the latest Earthdata services from NASA to produce a cutting-edge search and access client with features far beyond what was possible only a couple of years ago. Earthdata Search provides data discovery through the Common Metadata Repository (CMR), which provides a high-speed REST API for searching across hundreds of millions of data granules using temporal, spatial, and other constraints. It produces data visualizations by combining CMR data with Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) image tiles. Earthdata Search renders its visualizations using custom plugins built on Leaflet.js, a lightweight mobile-friendly open source web mapping library. The client further features an SVG-based interactive timeline view of search results. For data access, Earthdata Search provides easy temporal and spatial subsetting as well as format conversion by making use of OPeNDAP. While the client hopes to drive adoption of these services and standards, it provides fallback behavior for working with data that has not yet adopted them. This allows the client to remain on the cutting-edge of service offerings while still boasting a catalog containing thousands of data collections. In this session, we will walk through Earthdata Search and explain how it incorporates these new technologies and service offerings.",

The goal of the study was to determine whether the Active Sensing of CO2 over Nights, Days and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission would be able to detect changes in XCO2 given changes in the underlying fluxes for different levels of instrument precision. Three scenarios were proposed: a flux-neutral shift in fossil fuel emissions from Europe to China (shown in the figure); a permafrost melting event; interannual variability in the Southern Oceans. The conclusions of H14 were modest but favorable for detectability in each case by ASCENDS given enough observations and sufficient precision. These signal detection experiments suggest that ASCENDS observations, together with a chemical transport model and data assimilation methodology, would be sufficient to provide quality estimates of the underlying surface fluxes, so long as the ASCENDS observations are precise enough.\nIn this work, we present results that bridge the gap between the previous signal detection work by [Hammerling et al., 2014] and the ability of transport models to recover flux perturbations from ASCENDS observations utilizing the TM5-4DVAR data assimilation system. In particular, we will explore the space of model and observational uncertainties that will yield useful scientific information in each of the flux perturbation scenarios. This work will give a sense of the ability of ASCENDS to answer key questions about some of the foremost questions in carbon cycle science today.\n",

            "abstract": "Seismic investigations of permafrost are essential in cold-region applications including static corrections for seismic exploration and site characterization for infrastructure development. Surface-wave methods are advantageous because their applicability does not require regular velocity gradients. But distinct challenges also exist: The irregular velocity variations in permafrost, combined with the marked velocity contrasts between frozen and unfrozen ground, often yield complicated dispersion spectra in which higher-order and leaky modes are dominant. Owing to the difficulties in retrieving dispersion curves from such spectra, dispersion-curved-based inversion methods become inapplicable.\nHere we present a case study of using wavefield inversion of surface waves to infer the permafrost structure on the Barrow Peninsula of the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. In May of 2014, we conducted an active multichannel surface-wave survey along a 4300-m (2.7-mi) NE-SW trending transect that extended from the coastal to the interior areas of the peninsula. We acquired surface-wave supergathers—each covering a distance of 147 meters—from four nearly equidistantly distributed subsections of the transect. The dispersion spectra show dominant higher-order and leaky modes, as well as inversely dispersive trends (i.e., phase velocities increase with increasing frequencies). Preliminary results reveal a “sandwich” velocity structure, in which a pronounced low-velocity layer (with S-wave velocity reductions up to ~45%–60%; tens of meters thick; overlain by 3–4 m of high-velocity strata) is embedded within high-velocity strata, and the low-velocity layer itself contains irregular velocity gradients. Considering the low ground temperatures of –10 °C to –8 °C, this low-velocity feature is likely to be an embedded saline layer that is only partially frozen due to freezing-point depression of dissolved salts. Because saline permafrost is particularly sensitive to thermal disturbances, its extensive presence on the Barrow Peninsula may impact the stability of the permafrost system in a warming climate. This case study exemplifies the complexity of permafrost structures, and the surface-wave-based wavefield inversion is effective for delineating seismic structures of permafrost.",

            "abstract": "The inactive Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine is located in a volcanic region having geothermal flow and gas inputs into the Herman Pit impoundment. The acidic (pH 2 – 4) waters of the Herman Pit are permeated by hundreds of continuous flow gas seeps that contain CO2, H2S and CH4. We sampled one seep and found it to be composed of 95 % CO2 and 5 % CH4, in agreement with earlier measurements. Only a trace of ethane (10 – 20 ppm) was found and propane was below detection, resulting in a high CH4/C2H6 + C3H8 ratio of > 5,000, while the δ13CH4 and the δ13CO2 were respectively – 24 and – 11 per mil. Collectively, these results suggested a complex origin for the methane, being made up of a thermogenic component resulting from pyrolysis of buried organics, along with an active methanogenic portion. The relatively 12C-enriched value for the CO2 suggested a reworking of the ebullitive methane by methanotrophic bacteria. We found that dissolved methane in the collected water from 2-4 m depth was high (~ 400 µM), which would support methanotrophy in the lake's aerobic biomes. We therefore tested the ability of bottom sediments to consume methane by conducting aerobic incubations of slurried bottom sediments. Methane was removed from the headspace of live slurries, and subsequent additions of methane to the headspace over the course of 2-3 months resulted in faster removal rates suggesting a buildup of the population of methanotrophs. This activity could be transferred to an artificial medium originally devised for the cultivation of acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria (Silverman and Lundgren, 1959; J. Bacteriol. 77: 642 – 647), suggesting the possibility of future cultivation of acidophilic methanotrophs. A successful extraction of some hopanoid compounds from the sediments was achieved, although the results were too preliminary at the time of this writing to identify any hopanoids specifically linked to methanotrophic bacteria. Further efforts to amplify functional genes for methane oxidizing bacteria (e.g., pMMO) from extracted sediment DNA are underway.",

            "abstract": "We have obtained a 3-D model of seismic attenuation covering all of New Zealand, where regional structure ranges from strong, relatively undeformed crust to thin rift zones with active volcanism. This New Zealand-wide model will be useful for modeling tectonic deformation and coseismic motion at regional distances. Using local earthquakes, Qp (1/attenuation) is derived from path attenuation t* observations. The New Zealand model is primarily based on merged results from existing studies. These are supplemented with data in areas that were not previously analyzed for Qp, then using additional iterations with the merged model to ensure consistency. There is large heterogeneity in Qp both within some regions and along the length of the country. This suggests potential for greater variation in modeled ground motion compared to that estimated with uniform attenuation relations.\n Along the Hikurangi subduction zone, the subducted slab forms a prominent high Qp feature in the North Island and northern South Island. In the forearc, zones of low Qp above the plate interface suggest thick subducted sediment, and high Qp features represent blocks of Cretaceous volcanics in the overlying plate. The Taupo Volcanic Zone, with extension and geothermal activity, is delineated by low Qp in the upper crust. The underlying mantle wedge has very low Qp from 50-85 km depth below the rhyolite section. In contrast, the Fiordland subduction zone, southwestern South Island, lacks a mantle wedge and instead has the young slab steeply bending against a broad high Qp feature in the Pacific mantle which may represent mantle shortening or relic oceanic slab material.\n The South Island crust exhibits relatively high Qp, which is related to the Otago schist, igneous terranes, and mafic lower crust. Between the subduction zones, the Alpine fault and Marlborough fault zones accommodate plate motion. These fault zones show low Qp in their high-strain ductile roots, related to grain-size reduction and metamorphic fluid release. In the brittle crust, low Qp is imaged along fault zones which have the most recent large earthquakes and may be related to distributed microfractures.",

            "abstract": "Effective collaboration starts with the ability to easily and reliably access data across data center holdings regardless of data format. Incorporating a seamless data format conversion system with multiple organizational views of the data presents a formidable challenge given the many different file formats and variable ways data is organized by different data centers for data discovery and file retrieval. We will present results on how the Multi-View Lightweight Virtual File System (MLVFS) can be used by a broad range of machines to seamlessly access data from multiple data centers in client requested formats and views.\nWe consider two aspects for effective collaboration: first, seeing what data are available, and second, accessing and converting the data on the fly. There are many tools which address these problems. For example, protocols such as OGC-WCS and OPeNDAP allow for standardized methods of data discovery, retrieval, and format conversions. Custom tools developed in-house are used to provide multiple views of available data. These solutions, however, require separate data search, retrieval, or conversion stages, and usually require local storage to hold the converted data. Additionally, these solutions require custom tools to be developed specifically for accessing a particular data center.\nWith MLVFS, we take a radically different approach to this problem. Data centers can provide their data sets in any desired format or organized in any organizational view using well established protocols. Collaborators will see all datasets of interest to them appear on their local desktops without having to retrieve the data prior to using it. Additionally, MLVFS will perform on the fly conversion of the datasets stored at the data center to the desired format. MLVFS will free the users from unnecessary tasks, such as data retrieval and conversion, and will allow them to concentrate on tasks related to using the datasets. MLVFS will also free up available resources for users, as they will not have to store local copies of the data, and no data will get transferred unless accessed. MLVFS will do this without requiring the user to learn a new protocol or rewrite any code.\nWe will use MODAPS datasets as a case study for this approach converting the native HDF4 dataset to HDF5 for processing.",

            "abstract": "NASA's LEARN Project is an innovative program that provides long-term immersion in the practice of atmospheric science for middle and high school in-service teachers. Working alongside NASA scientists and using authentic NASA Science Mission Directorate research data, teachers develop individual research topics of interest during two weeks in the summer while on-site at NASA Langley. With continued, intensive mentoring by NASA scientists, the teachers further develop their research throughout the academic year through virtual group meetings and data team meetings mirroring scientific collaborations. At the end of the first year, LEARN teachers present scientific posters. The LEARN experience has had such an impact that multiple teachers from the first two cohorts have elected to continue their research. The LEARN project evaluation has provided insights into particularly effective elements of this new approach. Findings indicate that teachers’ perceptions of the scientific enterprise have changed, and that LEARN provided substantial resources to help them take real-world research to their students. This presentation will focus on key factors from LEARN’s implementation that inform best practices for the incorporation of authentic scientific research into teacher professional development experiences. We suggest that these factors should be considered in the development of other such experiences, including: (1) The involvement of a single scientist as both the project leader/manager and the project scientist, to ensure that the project can meet teachers’ needs. (2) An emphasis on framing and approaching scientific research questions, so that teachers can learn to evaluate the feasibility of studies based on scope, scale, and availability of data. (3) Long term, ongoing relationships where teachers and scientists work as collaborators, beyond the workshop “mold.” (4) A focus on meeting the needs of individual teachers, whether their needs relate to elements of research and analysis, or to their tight professional schedules. (5) Above all, flexibility and patience. LEARN builds relationships with teachers slowly, over a long period of time. In the middle, life often intervenes. LEARN has emphasized that teachers’ success is more important than deadlines or following a rigid protocol.",

            "abstract": "The optical properties of black carbon (BC) are significantly affected by its aging process in the atmosphere. We have built a conceptual model defining three BC aging stages, including freshly emitted BC aggregates, coating by soluble material and hygroscopic growth. We apply an improved geometric-optics surface-wave approach (Liou et al., 2011; Takano et al., 2013) to calculate the absorption and scattering properties of BC at each stage and compare the theoretical results with those obtained from laboratory experiments (Zhang et al., 2008; Khalizov et al., 2009). Preliminary results show a general agreement between calculated and measured BC absorption cross sections (bias < 10%) and scattering cross sections (bias < 30%) for BC aerosols with mobility diameters of 155, 245 and 320 nm at Stages 1 and 2, where BC is coated by sulfuric acid and its water solution, respectively. We find that the calculated scattering and absorption cross sections for fresh BC aggregates (Stage 0) with different sizes are invariably larger than experimental results partly because of the uncertainty in theoretical calculations for BC with size parameters less than 1. It appears that the uncertainty in the experiment could also contribute to the discrepancy, considering that the measuring instrument missed some scattering in certain angles (0-7° and 170-180°). Finally, we will apply the conceptual model and the single-scattering results to assess the effects of BC aging processes on direct radiative forcing using observed BC vertical profiles.",

To be most useful, this information should be easily found, well-documented, and translated into tools that decision-makers use and trust. To meet these needs, the President’s Climate Action Plan includes efforts to develop “actionable climate science”.\nThe Climate Data Initiative (CDI) leverages the Federal Government’s extensive, open data resources to stimulate innovation and private-sector entrepreneurship in support of actions to prepare for climate change. The Initiative forges commitments and partnerships from the private, NGO, academic, and public sectors to create data-driven tools. Open data from Federal agencies to support this innovation is available on Climate.Data.gov, initially focusing on coastal flooding but soon to expand to topics including food, energy, water, energy, transportation, and health.\nThe Climate Resilience Toolkit (CRT) will facilitate access to data-driven resilience tools, services, and best practices, including those accessible through the CDI. The CRT will also include access to training and tutorials, case studies, engagement forums, and other information sources.\nThe Climate Action Plan also calls for a public-private partnership on extreme weather risk, with the goal of generating improved assessments of risk from different types of extreme weather events, using methods and data that are transparent and accessible.\nFinally, the U.S. Global Change Research Program and associated agencies work to advance the science necessary to inform decisions and sustain assessments.\nCollectively, these efforts represent increased emphasis across the Federal Government on the importance of information to support climate resilience.",

            "abstract": "The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals calcite and aragonite are the primary reservoir for oxidized carbon in the continental crust and upper mantle, and are the dominant carriers of carbon into the Earth’s interior. Their solubility in subduction zone fluids strongly influences the amount of carbon retained in downgoing lithosphere. Previous work suggests modest solubility in pure H2O, but high solubility in NaCl-H2O solutions; however, natural solutions may contain additional cations such as KCl. We evaluated the role of salt on calcite solubility in salt-H2O solutions involving NaCl, KCl, LiCl and CsCl. All experiments were conducted in a piston-cylinder apparatus at 700 °C and 8 kbar. These conditions were used because pressure is not expected to have a large effect on the nature of calcite dissolution in saline fluids. Results show that increasing the concentration of any salt exponentially increases calcite solubility for all salt-H2O and mixed salt-H2O solutions. At a given salt mole fraction in one-salt solutions, calcite solubility increases with decreasing salt cation size: CsCl<KCl<NaCl<LiCl. Experiments in mixed salt solutions revealed that calcite solubility varied systematically with salt components and their concentrations. The data were used to derive a simple empirical model for calcite solubility in any H2O-KCl-NaCl-LiCl solution. The model reproduces the data in two-salt and three-salt solutions with an average deviation of 6% and 1% respectively. This study shows that aqueous fluids with high concentrations of halide salts have the potential to promote substantial carbon mass transfer. With the growing evidence for highly saline brines in a range of high pressure geologic environments, these fluids may play an important role in the deep carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Akumal, Mexico, was the first tourist resort in the Mexican Caribbean mainland, its highly developed coastal zone lies directly above the phreatic, and it is directly connected to the sub-littoral waters. Akumal is also known as a well-developed fringing coral reef, now in a critical condition. The main objective of this study was to explore the relationship between two of the main indicators of human pressure (nutrients and sedimentation, linked to coastal development and water run-offs) and the condition of the reef benthos, during a year. The sampling design used four transects perpendicular to shore, associated to different tourist and water run-off exposure, for a total of 12 stations distributed in three different reef zones (transition zone, shallow and deep spurs and grooves). Monthly samples were collected: water samples close to the reef lagoon drain channels and at bottom depth at each station, and sediment traps were recovered and replaced also at each station. Reef Benthos videotransects were recorded bi-monthly at each station to assess its condition. Macroalgae and filamentous algae dominate benthic cover (up to 50%), hard-coral cover ranges from 5-9%. Five coral-diseases were recorded, affecting 10.16% of the coral colonies: Caribbean Ciliate Infection, White Band, Purple Spots, White Spots and Yellow Band. The sedimentation rate -sr- ranged from 0.13 to 83.7 mg/cm2/day during the year; 86% of the samples had a sr ≤ 10 mg/cm2/day (reefs not stressed); 13% of the samples had a sr ranging from 10 to 50 mg/cm2/day (stressed reefs); and 1% of the samples were over the critical threshold (>50 mg/cm2/day). Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen concentrations during the year were above those recorded previously in Caribbean reefs. The most abundant fraction was ammonium, surpassing both Mexican norms: For protection of aquatic life in coastal zones (0.01 mg/L), and the critical threshold for aquatic life (0.4 mg/L). These concentration limits are considered as drivers of eutrophication, one of the main established causes of reef degradation globally. High concentrations of ammonium and other nutrients have been linked to increases in algae cover and coral diseases incidence, and to decreases in rates of coral calcification, fertility, production and viability of coral larvae, and the associated diversity loss.",

            "abstract": "The ever-burgeoning satellite remote sensing era has significantly improved our understanding of the role aerosol particles play in the earth-atmosphere system. Instruments such as MODIS, MISR, OMI, AVHRR, and now VIIRS, among others, are meeting a growing number of observational demands necessary for characterizing aerosol particle influence, on processes such as surface air quality, direct and semi-direct forcing and cloud indirect effects. While these passive sensors have grown to represent the community’s fundamental global aerosol observing core, their datasets represent, almost exclusively, a column-integrated view of atmospheric aerosols. In contrast, however, aerosol-climate interaction is inherently sensitive to the vertical distribution of aerosol particle presence.\nThough the CALIOP instrument, with its relatively limited profiling swath, offers a much smaller observational scale compared with passive imagers, active-sensor aerosol profiling is increasingly adding the necessary vertical perspective required to challenge and fully characterize what has become a predominant two-dimensional global perception of aerosols. In this talk, we highlight the impact of CALIOP-based profiling, and describe how the critical third dimension is contributing to this knowledge. We introduce aerosol scale-heights and the contribution of near-surface particle presence relative to column-integrated aerosol optical depths. We describe the impact of particle profile diffusivity relative to passive-based estimates of surface air quality. The impact of accurate vertical profiling in global modeling systems is conceptualized, through benefits to downwind forecasting from accurate initialization. Sensitivities in semi-direct regional heating rate estimates are shown as a function of model-constrained aerosol vertical profiling. Finally, we highlight perhaps the most important CALIOP observation of all, relative to the passive sensors: the presence of optically-thin cirrus clouds. We describe the sensitivity in passive estimates of direct aerosol forcing based on active cloud-clearing.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this project, which is part of the EARTHCHEM initiative, is to compile the existing experimental trace element partitioning data, and to develop a transparent, accessible resource for the community. The primary goal of experimental trace element partitioning studies is to create a database that can be used to develop models of how trace elements behave in natural geochemical systems. The range of approaches as to how this is accomplished and how the data are reported differs dramatically from one system to another and one investigator to another. This provides serious challenges to the creation of a coherent database – and suggests the need for a standard format for data presentation and reporting.\nThe driving force for this compilation is to provide community access to the complete database for trace element experiments. Our new effort includes all the published analytical results from experimental determinations. In compiling the data, we have set a minimum standard for the data to be included. The threshold criteria include:\nExperimental conditions (temperature, pressure, device, container, time, etc.)\nMajor element composition of the phases\nTrace element analyses of the phases\nData sources that did not report these minimum components were not included. The rationale for not including such data is that the degree of equilibration is unknown, and more important, no rigorous approach to modeling the behavior of trace elements is possible without a knowledge of the actual concentrations or the temperature and pressure of formation.\nThe data are stored using a schema derived from that of the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR), modified to account for additional metadata, and restructured to permit multiple analytical entries for various element/technique/standard combinations.\nOur ultimate goal is to produce a database together with a flexible user interface that will be useful for experimentalists to set up their work and to build calibration datasets, for petrologists to find appropriate partition coefficients, and to help reviewers evaluate models submitted for publication. As an additional benefit, we hope that this investigation will help to set new publication standards for experimental data.\nThe database will be assessable at the portal lepr.ofm-research.org.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) reverse buoyancy to form buoyant plumes after sufficient entrainment and heating of ambient atmosphere and deposition of suspended sediment. The deposits associated with buoyancy reversal depend on input from the feeding flow. It is expected that fines are swept away by the buoyant plume, and coarse sediment might be deposited preferentially during reversal; in an extreme case, one might expect deposit thickening at the point of buoyancy reversal as the coarse sediment rains out of the lofting plume. Alternatively, a thinner, finer grained deposit would be expected from a flow that deposited the bulk of its coarse sediment load prior to buoyancy reversal. The PDC associated with the 18 May 1980 Mt. St. Helens lateral blast downed trees as it traversed the ground (blowdown zone); at the distal extent of the blowdown zone, trees were burned, yet remained standing, in an area thought to represent a well-constrained case of PDC buoyancy reversal (singe zone). We present a sedimentological analysis of preserved deposits from the blowdown and singe zones to investigate this transition. The PDC deposit is poorly sorted, gray, sandy ash, generally <15 cm thick, and is locally normally graded. The unit includes lapilli sized clasts, with fragments of pumice, lithics, and, locally, wood fragments. Flow velocities at the blowdown/singe zone transition varied by a factor of ~2, and, where the flow velocities were slower, deceleration occurred within the blowdown zone prior to lift-off. In the singe zone, the deposit is structureless, and thins from <10 cm to <5 cm thick over a distance of 0.5-1 km. The grain-size distribution and sorting of the unit within the singe zone is broadly similar to deposits in the blowdown zone, but either become better sorted where deceleration in the blowdown zone preceded lift-off, or fine at the point of lift-off before becoming fines poor further downstream. These data indicate that the flow experienced only partial buoyancy reversal, and a dense undercurrent continued to move through the singe zone. However, in areas where tree blowdown orientations indicate that the buoyant plume was fed from multiple directions, the singe zone deposits fine towards the center of the area of focusing, and the <63 μm size fraction increases to as much as ~20 wt. % of the deposit.",

Goals of both partnerships were to: (1) synthesize published information and data to assess the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of key resource areas, including water use, infrastructure, fisheries, and vegetation and disturbance; (2) develop science-based adaptation strategies and tactics that will help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and assist the transition of biological systems and management to a warmer climate; (3) ensure adaptation strategies and tactics are incorporated into relevant planning documents; and (4) foster an enduring partnership to facilitate ongoing dialogue and activities related to climate change in the partnerships regions. After an initial vulnerability assessment by agency and university scientists and local resource specialists, adaptation strategies and tactics were developed in a series of scientist-manager workshops. The final vulnerability assessments and adaptation actions are incorporated in technical reports. The partnerships produced concrete adaptation options for national forest and other natural resource managers and illustrated the utility of place-based vulnerability assessments and scientist-manager workshops in adapting to climate change.",

            "abstract": "3D GPR surveys in the covered karst terrain of west-central Florida, USA, reveal surprising geometries of surficial sediments. Several meters of surficial sands overlie progressively more clay-rich sediments, which in turn overlie weathered limestone. The top of a clay-rich horizon produces an exceptionally clear GPR reflector visible from depths between 0.5 and ~8 meters. On length scales of 10-20 meters, the geometry of this horizon as it drapes over underlying weathered limestone suggests that depressions are not conical, but instead more complex troughs that surround domed stratigraphic highs. Azimuthal semi-variograms of the clay horizon depth show greatest correlation in directions that are aligned with the direction of elevated resistivities at depths to 10-14 meters. One possible interpretation is that dissolution in underlying limestone is concentrated in elongated zones rather than in columnar or spherical voids. Elongated sand-filled depressions in the clay layer produce azimuthal resistivity highs in the direction of the elongation. This direction in turn corresponds to the major axis of depressions in the clay-rich GPR reflecting horizon. Groundwater recharge in this area is concentrated into conduits that breach the clay-rich units that overlie the limestone aquifer. This study suggests that the conduits themselves may be elongated features rather than cylindrical in form. Recharge flow paths may be more complex than previously recognized. The high-resolution GPR images require 3D surveys with 250 MHz and 500 MHz antennas, with 10-cm line spacings, careful corrections for antenna positions and 3D migrations of the data.",

Organizations that are part of the scientific enterprise, as well as members of the scientific community who work within these entities, can contribute to the sustainability of science software and to practices that improve scientific community capabilities for science software sustainability. As science becomes increasingly digital and therefore, dependent on software, improving community practices for sustainable science software will contribute to the sustainability of science.\nMembers of the Earth science informatics community, including scientific data producers and distributers, end-user scientists, system and application developers, and data center managers, use science software regularly and face the challenges and the opportunities that science software presents for the sustainability of science. To gain insight on practices needed for the sustainability of science software from the science software experiences of the Earth science informatics community, an interdisciplinary group of 300 community members were asked to engage in simultaneous roundtable discussions and report on their answers to questions about the requirements for improving scientific software sustainability. This paper will present an analysis of the issues reported and the conclusions offered by the participants. These results provide perspectives for science software sustainability practices and have implications for actions that organizations and their leadership can initiate to improve the sustainability of science software.",

Administrated by the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, the goal of PolarTREC is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing K-12 educators and polar researchers together.\nSince 2007, the PolarTREC program evaluation has been collecting deep and diverse sets of data from all audiences engaged in the project. Nearly all expeditions focus on at least one aspect of climate change science. Teacher and researcher participants are queried pre- and post- expedition on their knowledge and interested in polar science, K-12 education, and a critique of the PolarTREC program. A specific highlight is the thousands of students surveyed in regards to their knowledge gain, attitudes, and interest in science learning. Additionally, longitudinal studies expose the myriad of ways that the PolarTREC program influences teachers and their practice many years after program completion. The findings influence and shape the program every year, nearly perfecting the strategy for communicating climate change science to audiences around the world.\nThis presentation will present the social science research findings in our extensive evaluation and provide best practices for program structure as well as evaluation methods to best capture the impact on audiences beyond participants.",

            "abstract": "High frequency (HF) cross modulation experiments are a well established means for probing the HF-modified characteristics of the D-region ionosphere. The interaction between the heating wave and the probing pulse depends on the ambient and modified conditions of the D-region ionosphere. Cross-modulation observations are employed as a measure of the HF-modified refractive index. We employ an optimized version of Fejer's method that we developed during previous experiments. Experiments were performed in March 2013 at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) observatory in Gakona, Alaska. During these experiments, the power of the HF heating signal incrementally increased in order to determine the dependence of cross-modulation on HF power. We found that a simple power law relationship does not hold at high power levels, similar to previous ELF/VLF wave generation experiments. In this paper, we critically compare these experimental observations with the predictions of a numerical ionospheric HF heating model and demonstrate close agreement.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change is an increasingly important driver of changes in the biogeograpraphy of vegetation. Such changes have primarily been characterized by gradual shifts in species distribution; however, major disturbances acting in concert with climate change may result in a sudden ‘jump’ in biogeographical distribution. This study examines the effects of wildfire on forest composition along an environmental gradient in the eastern Cascade Mountains of Central Washington, USA. A previous study by Camp et al. (1997) examined three drainages in this complex mountainous landscape to identify and characterize historic wildfire refugia based on topographic characteristics and forest age and species composition. These drainages subsequently burned in the 2012 Table Mountain and Peavine Canyon fires. In 2014 the Camp et al. plots were re-established and re-sampled to (1) assess burn severity using the Composite Burn Index (CBI) protocol and (2) assess fire effects upon the individual trees in each study plot. Remotely sensed imagery classified using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) indicated these fires burned more intensely than historical fires in the region, providing a potential harbinger of future fire severity under climate change. Analysis of burn severity revealed that the fire burned across the entire environmental gradient of the drainages, with no significant difference in burn occurrence or burn severity between refugial and non-refugial plots as designated by Camp et al.; this suggests that historical wildfire refugia may no longer prove sustainable in an era of climate change. Additionally, trees characteristic of warmer and drier climates experienced lower fire mortality than trees typical of cooler and moister climates. If future reseeding and recruitment in the forest favors more xeric tree species, the 2012 fires may prove to be the disturbance event that precipitates a ‘jump’ in the biogeographic distribution of trees in these drainages.",

We report the detection of these tephras in microscopic form in three lakes along the Eastern Seaboard (Maine and Nova Scotia). These distinct distal lake layers occur as closely spaced couplets which retain the subtle geochemical variation that characterises the proximal Glacier Peak G and B layers. New radiocarbon dates for the tephras also closely corroborate the most recently revised proximal dates for the tephras (ca. 13,700 – 13,400 cal. yr B.P) which found that they are ca. 400 14C yr older than hitherto thought. Their presence this far eastward implies that their deposition spans the intervening continent (>4000 km) and adds to a developing distal tephrostratigraphical framework with applications to studies of latest Pleistocene deglaciation and environmental change, megafaunal extinction and archaeology.",

            "abstract": "Studies of tropospheric ozone trends over the southern African Highveld in the 1990-2007 period present a paradox. We used monthly averaged surface ozone data from 5 South African monitoring stations east of Johannesburg in a linear regression model to show that the cycles associated with the El Niño/La Niña make a considerable contribution to interannual ozone variability through perturbations in cloud cover, temperature and precipitation that interact with photochemistry (see Figure). During El Niño periods, typically sunnier and drier, summertime ozone is enhanced, whereas wetter, cloudier conditions of a La Niña are associated with lower ozone. Interestingly, the 5 stations show very little evidence of a statistically significant trend from 1990 through 2007. Over the same time period, the regression model shows that free tropospheric ozone, from 5-11 km, taken from monthly averaged SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesondes) and MOZAIC (Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapour on Airbus in-service Aircraft) profiles, increased significantly (+20-25%/decade) in late autumn and early winter (May-July). There is also a positive ozone trend near the tropopause in summer (Nov.-Dec.) but none during the oft-studied months of biomass fires (Sept.-Oct.). It is difficult to interpret the seemingly contradictory trends in terms of emissions of ozone precursors that are not well characterized over the Highveld and larger southern African region. However, we ran a series of back-trajectories at 500 and 300 hPa to coincide with the profile sampling times in May-August 1990-2007. Regional contributions are implicated by recirculation in the Johannesburg region. Trajectories also point to long-range transport from the greater African continent, south Atlantic and South America, all known regions of high ozone and in the case of South America, growing pollution from emerging mega-cities.",

            "abstract": "This work, carried out with an integrated methodological approach, describes the acquisition of gravity data and their integration with different geophysical techniques, in order to map and model the thickness of unconsolidated deposits and determine the bedrock configuration of two different intra-mountain plains: Leonessa plain (hereafter LP) and Rieti plain (hereafter RP).\nThe LP and the RP, the test areas of this study, are typical intra-mountain depressions of Center Apennines, related to the Plio-Quaternary extensional tectonic. Both basins are characterized by thick Quaternary fluvial-lacustrine deposits (gravel, sand and clay) overlaying the Meso-Cenozoic pelagic basin deposits.\nOn the LP, the study involved an area of 62 km2 occupied by 333 gravity stations. Instead, on the RP, the study area, of 35 km2, were occupied by 170 gravity stations. The gravity data resulted from the network adjustment were used to calculate the Bouguer anomaly map. Subtracting the regional field from the Bouguer anomaly produced the residual anomaly map.\nIn order to determine the distribution of the sedimentary infill, a 2D gravity modeling was developed in the region, including five profiles in the case study of LP and six profiles in the case study of RP. A realistic density of the unconsolidated Quaternary deposits (1.75-2,00 g/cm3 in the case of LP and 2,15 g/cm3 in the case of RP), a density of 2.50 g/cm3 for the Travertine and a density of 2.60 g/cm3 for the Meso-Cenozoic pelagic basin deposits were used to constrain the 2D gravimetric models. The models match quite well with the information determined from a collection of existing well logs and geophysical data obtained by the ambient noise, MASW and Downhole measurements.\nFinally, referring to these models, we were able to evaluate the thickness of the Quaternary sedimentary infilling and to define the 3D bedrock configuration of the basins. These 3D models represent a useful starting point for future activities such as microzonation or seismic hazard studies.",

            "abstract": "The Maipo basin holds 40% of Chile’s total population and almost half of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. The basin is located in the semiarid central region of the country and, aside from the typical pressures of growth in developing country basins, the Maipo river faces climate change impacts associated with a reduction in total runoff and changes in its seasonality. Surface water is the main water source for human settlements and economic activities including agriculture.\nIn 2012 we started a research project to create a climate variability and climate change adaptation plan for the basin. The pillars of the plan are co-produced by researchers and a Scenario Building Team (SBT) with membership of relevant water and land use stakeholders (including from civil society, public and private sectors) in the basin. Following similar experiences in other regions in the world that have faced the challenges of dealing with long term planning under uncertainty, the project has divided the task of developing the plan into a series of interconnected elements. A critical first component is to work on the desired vision(s) of the basin for the future. In this regards, the “water security” concept has been chosen as a framework that accommodates all objectives of the SBT members. Understanding and quantifying the uncertainties that could affect the future water security of the basin is another critical aspect of the plan. Near and long term climate scenarios are one dimension of these uncertainties that are combined with base development uncertainties such as urban growth scenarios. A third component constructs the models/tools that allows the assessment of impacts on water security that could arise under these scenarios. The final critical component relates to the development of the adaptation measures that could avoid the negative impacts and/or capture the potential opportunities. After two years in the development of the adaptation plan a series of results has been achieved in all critical components that are presented here. The success in the process now poses a series of new challenges, most importantly: how to implement and monitor the evolution of the adaptation process.",

Stakeholders’ engagement evaluation plan must be based on the timing and available resources of the mining company, understanding the goals for the engagement, and on analyzes of the possible risks from engagement.\nIn conclusion, the Stakeholders engagement evaluation plan includes: first, determinations of the stakeholders list, which must include any interested or effected by the mine projects groups, for example: state and local government representatives, people from local communities, business partners, environmental NGOs, indigenous people, and academic groups. The contacts and availability for communication is critical for Stakeholders engagement. Next, is to analyze characteristics of all these parties and determinate the level of interest and level of their influence on the project. The next step includes the Stakeholders matrix and mapping development, where all these information will be put together.After that, must be chosen the methods for stakeholders’ engagement. The methods usually depends from the goals of engagement (create the dialog lines, collect the data, determinations of the local issues and concerns, or establish the negotiation process) and available resources as a time, people, budget. Is it very important here to recognize the possible risks from the engagement and establish the key massage for stakeholders.

The GUVI instrument has long been a resource for the ITM community with a panoply of data products available from the GUVI website (http://guvi.jhuapl.edu). GUVI is in a high inclination orbit and so provides coverage of both hemispheres. With the release last year of the data products from the DMSO/SSUSI instrument, particularly more detailed auroral zone products (Q, E0, Hemispheric Power, discrete auroral arcs, proton precipitation regions), new equatorial ionospheric products (3D electron densities, bubbles), a whole new set of UV data products has become available. SSUSI are available from http://ssusi.jhuapl.edu. To leverage the experience and knowledge gained from running all of these instruments we have adapted the SSUSI products so they can be made from GUVI telemetry. There are now updated versions of GUVI legacy products as well as brand new products. In addition, better on-orbit calibration techniques developed for SSUSI have now been applied to the GUVI instrument calibration - there is now a common set of software for calibrating both instruments. With a common data format, calibration, and product definition, the data from all SSUSI and GUVI instruments can now be easily combined to get multiple instruments to cover the hemispheres to do a variety of global studies. In addition, the GUVI spectrographic mode data provides great detail about spectrographic features (e.g. O/N2 ratios, NO band emission) that are important for understanding dynamical processes in the thermosphere.

            "abstract": "The biovolume of animals has functioned as an important benchmark for measuring evolution throughout geologic time. In our project, we examined the observed average body size of ostracods over time in order to understand the mechanism of size evolution in these marine organisms. The body size of ostracods has varied since the beginning of the Ordovician, where the first true ostracods appeared. We created a stochastic branching model to create possible evolutionary trees of ostracod size. Using stratigraphic ranges for ostracods compiled from over 750 genera in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, we calculated overall speciation and extinction rates for our model. At each timestep in our model, new lineages can evolve or existing lineages can become extinct. Newly evolved lineages are assigned sizes based on their parent genera. We parameterized our model to generate neutral and directional changes in ostracod size to compare with the observed data. New sizes were chosen via a normal distribution, and the neutral model selected new sizes differentials centered on zero, allowing for an equal chance of larger or smaller ostracods at each speciation. Conversely, the directional model centered the distribution on a negative value, giving a larger chance of smaller ostracods. Our data strongly suggests that the overall direction of ostracod evolution has been following a model that directionally pushes mean ostracod size down, shying away from a neutral model. Our model was able to match the magnitude of size decrease. Our models had a constant linear decrease while the actual data had a much more rapid initial rate followed by a constant size. The nuance of the observed trends ultimately suggests a more complex method of size evolution. In conclusion, probabilistic methods can provide valuable insight into possible evolutionary mechanisms determining size evolution in ostracods.",

            "abstract": "Goals of geobiochemistry include simultaneously evaluating the relative stabilities of microbial cells and minerals, and predicting how the composition of biomolecules can change in response to the progress of geochemical reactions. Recent developments in theoretical geochemistry make it possible to predict standard thermodynamic properties of proteins, nucleotides, lipids, and many metabolites including the constituents of the citric acid cycle, at all temperatures and pressures where life is known to occur, and beyond. Combining these predictions with constraints from geochemical data makes it possible to assess the relative stabilities of biomolecules. Resulting independent predictions of the environmental occurrence of homologous proteins and lipid side-chains can be compared with observations from metagenomic and metalipidomic data to quantify geochemical driving forces that shape the composition of biomolecules. In addition, the energetic costs of generating biomolecules from within a diverse range of habitable environments can be evaluated in terms of prevailing geochemical variables. Comparisons of geochemical bioenergetic calculations across habitats leads to the generalization that the availability of H2 determines the cost of autotrophic biosynthesis relative to the aquatic environment external to microbial cells, and that pH, temperature, pressure, and availability of C, N, P, and S are typically secondary. Increasingly reduced conditions, which are determined by reactions of water with mineral surfaces and mineral assemblages, allow many biosynthetic reactions to shift from costing energy to releasing energy. Protein and lipid synthesis, as well as the reverse citric acid cycle, become energy-releasing processes under these conditions. The resulting energy balances that determine habitability contrast dramatically with assumptions derived from oxic surface conditions, such as those where human biochemistry operates.",

            "abstract": "Santa Cruz Island is one of the oldest volcanoes in the Galápagos Archipelago; little is known about its history or its evolutionary relationship to the younger western shield volcanoes. Of particular note, the island’s northern and southern flanks are deformed by a series of major normal faults of unknown origin. Using an array of multidisciplinary tools, including field mapping, GPS, gravity, Ar-Ar and geochronology, and 3He exposure dating, we construct a structural and volcanic history of Santa Cruz. The Ar-Ar ages reveal that since ~1.5 Ma, the island has experienced two phases of volcanism, separated by ~0.4 My. The first occurred from 1620 ± 15 to 1160 ± 35 ka (1σ); the second lasted from 699 ± 45 to 74 ± 19 ka. Volcanism during the second phase was focused along an E-W trending summit vent system, from which all <200 ka lavas were deposited on the southern flank. Structural observations suggest that the island has experienced two major faulting episodes. North flank faults formed after 1160 ± 35 ka, whereas the southern faults were initiated between 416 ± 18 and 27 ± 16 ka. Gravity results indicate two E-W trending, intrusive complexes; one is centered north of the island’s summit and the other is beneath the southern flank. When integrated, our data are consistent with a model wherein the northern faults are associated with regional uplift occurring after 1.1 Ma and before 0.78 Ma (paleomag.; Bow, 1979). This deformation event may be related to the formation of the summit vent system and the initiation of the second phase of volcanism. The second volcanism phase is coincident with the formation of the southern faults. Southward spreading along the island’s southern flank accommodated extension initiated by intrusions, which ceased with volcanism at ~20 ka. The extended volcanic activity characteristic of Santa Cruz and of other older Galapagos Islands may be the result of rejuvenated volcanism linked to regional uplift event(s); it may also contribute to development of the morphological differences between eastern and western volcanoes.",

In particular, the effects of solar wind Mach number and direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are examined. Simulations with solar wind Mach number of 3 and small IMF cone angles show sporadic formation of SHFAs. Increasing the Mach number shows the formation of large number of SHFAs. We use the properties of these SHFAs to show that their duration does not depend on Mach number indicating that the size SHFAs increases with solar wind Mach number. Similarly, the level of the solar wind deceleration associated with SHFAs increases with Mach number as does their core ion temperature. We also show that the edges of SHFAs are associated with jumps in magnetic field strength that increase with shock Mach number as does the rate of SHFA formation. Simulations with IMF cone angle of 90o show that SHFAs form at the quasi-parallel bow shock provided the shock Alfvén Mach number is ~>3, indicating that SHFAs can form at all IMF cone angles. Finally, we show that the interaction of SHFAs with the bow shock results in spatial and temporal changes in plasma and field conditions in the magnetosheath whose strength increases with solar wind Mach number. The details of this interaction are described in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost underlies ~70% of all National Park Service administered land in Alaska and it provides a stable foundation to parks’ ecosystems and wildlife habitats. However, the strength of this foundation is waning as its temperature is rising in response to recent climate warming. Consequently, thermokarst activities are on the rise and they are altering the parks’ landscape, ecosystems, and wildlife habitats. In order to effectively respond to these changes park managers need up-to-date knowledge of the current permafrost temperature and distribution, and how they might evolve with changing climate in the future. To help decision makers understand and respond to the changing permafrost condition, we are modeling near-surface permafrost dynamics—permafrost temperature, distribution, and active layer thickness—in eight national parks of Alaska at a decadal time scale. We are using GIPL 1.0 model (Spatially Distributed Model of Permafrost Dynamics in Alaska), the best available climate inputs, and high-resolution (28 m) ecotype, soil landscape, and snow inputs. Here we present results for two national parks—Denali National Park and Preserve (DENA) and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST). Areas underlain by glaciers and permanent ice-fields were excluded. In DENA, the model suggested near-surface permafrost in 51% of the park area for the 2000 decade, predicted its decline to 6% by 2050s, and 1% by 2090s. In WRST, the model suggested near-surface permafrost in 72% of the park area for the 2000 decade, predicted its decline to 42% by 2050s, and 15% by 2090s. In summary, the near-surface permafrost will likely be degrading in most parts of DENA and WRST towards the end of the current century except at higher elevations where climate models continue to project colder temperature. The modeled maps of DENA and WRST showed 86% and 95% agreement with the field observations of permafrost presence/ absence at 1375 and 430 sites, respectively. In conclusion, the modeled high-resolution permafrost maps show the effect of changing climate on near-surface permafrost. They offer decision makers a clear understanding of how near-surface permafrost distribution in the parks might change in the future, which was lacking up until now, to guide critical monitoring and management decisions.",

            "abstract": "Europa is a prime candidate to search for a present-day habitable environment in our solar system. As such, NASA has engaged a Science Definition Team (SDT) to define a strategy to advance our scientific understanding of this icy world with the goal: Explore Europa to investigate its habitability. A mission architecture is defined where a spacecraft in Jupiter orbit would make many close flybys of Europa, concentrating on remote sensing to explore the moon. The spacecraft trajectory would permit ~45 flybys at a variety of latitudes and longitudes, enabling globally distributed regional coverage of Europa’s surface. This concept is known as the Europa Clipper.\nThe SDT recommended three science objectives for the Europa Clipper: Ice Shell and Ocean--Characterize the ice shell and any subsurface water, including their heterogeneity, ocean properties, and the nature of surface-ice-ocean exchange; Composition--Understand the habitability of Europa's ocean through composition and chemistry; Geology--Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or current activity, and characterize high science interest localities. The SDT also considered implications of the recent HST detection of plumes at Europa.\nTo feed forward to potential future exploration that could be enabled by a lander, it was deemed that the Clipper should provide the capability to perform reconnaissance. In consultation with NASA Headquarters, the SDT developed a reconnaissance goal: Characterize Scientifically Compelling Sites, and Hazards, for a Potential Future Landed Mission to Europa. This leads to two objectives: Site Safety--Assess the distribution of surface hazards, the load-bearing capacity of the surface, the structure of the subsurface, and the regolith thickness; Science Value--Assess the composition of surface materials, the geologic context of the surface, the potential for geological activity, the proximity of near surface water, and the potential for active upwelling of ocean material.\nThe Clipper concept provides an efficient means to explore Europa and investigate its habitability. Development of the mission concept is ongoing with current studies focusing on spacecraft design trades and refinements, launch vehicle options (EELV and SLS), and power source (MMRTG and solar), to name a few.",

            "abstract": "The Whipple detachment fault in E. California is a classic example of a large-displacement (~40 km), low-angle normal fault formed during Miocene Basin and Range extension. The footwall of this fault exhibits a range of mid-crustal rocks deformed near the brittle-ductile transition, including mylonites, cataclasites, and pseudotachylites, which provide insight into mid-crustal rheology from steady-state to seismic strain rates. Here we focus on a diverse array of pseudotachylites discovered in the Whipple footwall that have not been previously described. We examine the structural contexts, morphologies, and compositions of the pseudotachylites and discuss their implications for seismogenesis on continental low-angle normal faults. \nVeins that we interpret to be pseudotachylites occur as planar, anastomosing, and reservoir-like injections found along the margins of dikes, along mini-detachments kinematically linked to the Whipple fault, and within a few tens of centimeters below the silicified, erosionally resistant “microbreccia ledge” of the main detachment. The orientations of the vein generation surfaces are dominantly shallowly E-dipping, subparallel to the detachment fault itself; some occur on higher angle normal faults that sole into low angle shear zones. Veins were not found cutting the microbreccia ledge itself, suggesting that comminution and silicification post-dates pseudotachylite formation.\nIn thin section, the veins exhibit a range in composition and degree of preservation. Some contain lath-shaped spherulites, others contain opaque, microcrystalline matrices with relict flow banding and embayed, primarily quartz clasts. Some pseudotachylite veins grade into cataclasites at their margins, suggesting cataclasis was precursory to vein formation, whereas others cut pristine mylonites with no evidence of earlier brittle deformation. Those that cut pristine mylonites contain clasts with dynamically recrystallized quartz grains with diameters of 5-7 μm. This suggests a minimum shear stress for formation of the pseudotachylite veins of 60-80 MPa based on quartz paleopiezometry. \nThese data provide evidence that the low-angle Whipple fault and associated structures was seismically active at mid-crustal depths.",

Here we present an example of discovery-based research in Neotectonics, a second-tier course predominantly enrolling first-and second-year students; describe the steps involved in the four week project; and discuss early outcomes of student confidence, engagement and retention.\nIn the San Gorgonio Pass region (SGPR) in southern California, the San Andreas fault undergoes a transition from predominantly strike-slip to a complex system of faults with significant dip-slip, resulting in diffuse deformation and raising the question of whether a large earthquake on the San Andreas could propagate through the region (Yule, 2009). In spring 2014, seven students in the Neotectonics course conducted original research investigating quantifiable geomorphic evidence of tectonic activity in the SGPR. Students addressed questions of [1] unequal uplift in the San Bernardino Mountains, [2] fault activity indicated by stream knick points, [3] the role of fault style on mountain front sinuosity, and [4] characteristic earthquake slip determined via fault scarp degradation models. Students developed and revised individual projects, collaborated with each other on methods, and presented results in a public forum. A final class day was spent reviewing the projects and planning future research directions.\nPre- and post-course surveys show increases in students’ self-confidence in the design, implementation, and presentation of original scientific inquiries. 5 of 6 eligible students participated in research the following summer, the same 5 enrolled in the follow-up course for Fall 2014, and one student changed her major from the social sciences in order to conduct geology senior thesis research.\nPCAST: http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pcast/docsreports\nReinen et al., CUR-Quarterly, 2006.\nYule, Geology, 2009.",

            "abstract": "We present a new approach to measuring crustal thickness and bulk properties from teleseismic data. In contrast to the traditional H-k stacking approach, which involves receiver-function deconvolution followed by stacking along expected arrival-time curves, we eliminate the deconvolution step and generate synthetic transfer functions predicting the relationship between the vertical and radial components. Given a catalogue of precalculated transfer functions, we convolve the vertical component with each assumed transfer function and then calculate a misfit between the real and predicted radial component. As a single-layer crust is no longer a necessary assumption, we use the transfer-function approach to extend H-k analysis to models containing sedimentary basins. We apply this new technique to two data sets: one from Earthscope instrumentation in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, USA, and one from the FaultLab project, which instrumented the branching North Anatolian Fault, Turkey. From the US data set, we find that the transfer-function approach is able to recover approximate sedimentary thickness in the Williston Basin, as well as remove the contaminating effects of the sedimentary layers from crustal thickness and basement P/S velocity ratio measurements, and so detect westward crustal thinning towards the Trans-Hudson Orogen that may represent crustal erosion related to the orogenic process, as well as compositional differences between Superior and Trans-Hudson basement rocks. The data from Turkey reveal a \"stair-step\" northward deepening of the Moho across the two major strands of the North Anatolian Fault and a northward decrease in the P/S velocity ratio, overlain by highly variable sediment thicknesses reflecting a complex system of pull-apart basins in the upper crust.",

Quantifying the nature and timing of the risk is difficult because (1) we often fail to understand the connection between anthropogenic pressures and the timing and extent of ecosystem changes; and (2) the concept of risk is inherently coupled to human perception, which generally differs with cultural and socio-economic conditions. In this study, we endeavor to assess aquatic ecosystem risks across an international array of six study sites. The challenge is to construct a methodology capable of capturing the marked biogeographical, socioeconomic, and cultural differences among the sites, which include: (1) Muskoka River watershed in humid continental Ontario, Canada; (2) Lower San Joaquin River, an impounded snow-fed river in semi-arid Central California; (3) Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, a tropical coastal lagoon in Colombia; (4) Senguer River basin in the semi-arid part of Argentina; (5) Laguna de Rocha watershed in humid subtropical Uruguay; and (6) Palomas Lake complex in oceanic Chilean Patagonia. Results will include a characterization of the experimental gradient over the six sites, an overview of the risk assessment methodology, and preliminary findings for several of the sites.",

            "abstract": "Don Quixote Pond, like Don Juan Pond in the South Fork of Wright Valley, Antarctica, is a model for calcium and chlorine weathering and distribution on Mars. It is located in the western part of the North Fork about 100 m above Mean Seawater Level; its brine is seasonally frozen [1]. Field observations show zones of discoloration which grow lighter with distance from the pond edges.\nFour sediment cores, a set of radial surface samples, special surface samples, and samples of local rocks were obtained [2]. We report on chemical and mineral analyses of traverse samples and on two cores. Core DQ20 is a northeastern shoreline core. Its soluble salt concentration exceeds 200 micromoles/g in the top 5 cm, and then falls to less than 70 micromoles/g at the permafrost depth of 15 cm. These concentrations are low when compared to similarly positioned locations at Don Juan Pond and to cores from Prospect Mesa close to Lake Vanda, Wright Valley. Halite, soda niter, tachyhydrite and/bischovite are suggested from the ionic molar relationships\nMeasured halite concentrations of surface samples, collected along a traverse of 35 m from the pond outwards, range from over 5% to trace amounts, decreasing with distance. Gypsum is also present in almost all of these samples ranging from 0.2% to 2.6%, but does not exhibit a trend. However, in core DQ35, located at a distance of 15 m along the traverse, gypsum decreases from 2.5% to 0.6% from the surface to the permafrost depth of 12 cm.\nWhile DQ35 and radial samples show high quartz and albite abundance, samples that contained visible encrustations and evaporites are low in these minerals and rich in highly diverse alteration products.\nDon Juan Basin ponds may have formed by a complex surface water mobilization of weathering products [3] and local groundwater action [4,5]. In contrast, Don Quixote pond mineralogy and chemistry may be consistent with a less complex shallow and deep groundwater system origin [1].\n[1] Harris H.J.H. & Cartwright K., 1981, in: Dry Valley Drilling Project, L.D.

            "abstract": "Alaskan arctic lakes lay covered by up to three meters of ice and snow for approximately two-thirds of the year, yet comparatively little is known about their ecosystem metabolism during this period. We combined the use of free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the laboratory incubation of sediment cores to characterize spatial and temporal patterns in the ecosystem respiration (ER) of five arctic lakes spanning a gradient in size from 1 to 150 ha. Seasonal rates of ER throughout the water column ranged from < 0.001 to 0.034 mg L-1 h-1; sediment ER ranged from mg 6.1 m-2 h-1 to 50.7 mg m-2 h-1. Although there were significant differences in sediment ER among lakes, average water column ER did not differ significantly. Seasonal patterns of DO draw down were most often linear. However, within the water column above the deepest basin of each lake, rates were higher during autumn – winter than winter – spring, with the lowest rates typically found in the upper 70% of the water column and the highest rates near the bottom. ER measured near the bottom along the slope of lake basins was lower than that at the center of lake basins and closer in magnitude to water column ER. Spatial patters in free-water rates were reflected by sediment ER, which was 21 – 66 % higher in cores collected from the deepest point of lake basins than in sediments collected at shallower locations found at the margin of basins. These observations suggest that two mechanisms operating in tandem account for the higher apparent rates of DO drawdown found within lake basins during the winter. Higher local rates of sediment ER and, similar to observations in other lakes, the transport of DO depleted waters from lake margins to deep basins. Together they contribute to the formation of hypoxia in the deeper basins of lakes and the concentration of other respiratory products, with important implications for energy flow within lakes and carbon budgets across the arctic.",

            "abstract": "Lunar magnetic fields, though small in scale and comparatively weak, have surprisingly significant effects on the incoming plasma, and a number of observations suggest that their presence may locally alter the space weathering of the surface. Recent observations from Kaguya and Chandrayaan have shown that lunar magnetic anomalies efficiently reflect incoming solar wind protons, providing substantial shielding of portions of the crust, with potential implications for both space weathering and surface sputtering. The two ARTEMIS probes have made a number of low-altitude (tens of kilometers) passes over regions with moderately strong crustal magnetic fields, at local times both near the sub-solar point and at the terminator. Several such passes occurred over a region of the surface containing unusual albedo markings - or \"swirls\" - that could indicate a local reduction in space weathering. We investigate the ARTEMIS low-altitude passes in detail, focusing on how the observed reflected protons and other local modifications of charged particle distributions and electromagnetic fields relate to the properties of the surface.",

            "abstract": "Hydrate saturation of gas-hydrate bearing sediment is a key of gas production from natural gas-hydrate reservoir. Developable natural gas-hydrates by conventional gas/oil production apparatus almost exist in unconsolidated sedimental layer. Generally, hydrate saturations of sedimental samples are directly estimated by volume of gas generated from dissociation of gas hydrates in pore spaces, porosity data and volume of the sediments. Furthermore, hydrate saturation can be also assessed using velocity of P-wave through sedimental samples. Nevertheless, hydrate saturation would be changed by morphological variations (grain-coating, cementing and pore-filling model) of gas hydrates in pore spaces. Jin et al.[1,2] recently observed the O-H stretching bands of H2O molecules of methane hydrate in porous media using an attenuated total reflection IR (ATR−IR) spectra. They observed in situ hydrate formation/dissociation process in sandy samples (Tohoku Keisya number 8, grain size of ca. 110 μm). In this presentation, we present IR spectroscopy approach to in situ evaluation of hydrate saturation of pressured gas-hydrate sediments.

            "abstract": "The Kalkarindji continental flood basalt province (CFBP) of northern Australia is the oldest Phanerozoic large igneous province (LIP) in the world. The extent of this Middle Cambrian LIP has been estimated to at least 2.1 x 106 km2 with exposures in Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. The research into Kalkarindji is still in its infancy with only a handful of studies published. The rocks of the Kalkarindji province occur as lava flows, sills, dykes, and volcanic tuffs. Kalkarindji has been linked to an extinction event at the Early-Middle Cambrian boundary. The Kalkarindji province displays Low-Ti values and high SiO2 values compared to other large igneous provinces, enriched 87Sr/86Sr values, and low 187Os/188Os. This project presents a large data set of new geochemical analyses of the various constituents of the Kalkarindji CFBP. Source mixing calculations, assimilation and fractionation models, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to understand the petrogenesis of the province. The trace element and 87Sr/86Sr values indicate a contribution of enriched crustal-like material into the source region; however, the Os values fall into typical mantle ranges. These geochemical patterns suggest that the mantle source(s) of the Kalkarindji CFBP has been directly enriched at some stage of history, before the emplacement of the province. This study will provide further insights into the magma source and origin processes needed to create one of the world’s largest and oldest Phanerozoic large igneous provinces.",

To realize this potential, resources are needed that explicate the range of repository options available for locating and depositing open data, their conditions of access and use, and the services and tools they provide.\nThis study profiled 38 open digital repositories in the atmospheric and climate sciences, analyzing each on 55 criteria through content analysis of their websites. The results provide a systematic way to assess and compare capabilities, services, and institutional characteristics and identify trends across repositories. Selected results from the more detailed outcomes to be presented:\nMost repositories offer guidance on data format(s) for submission and dissemination.\n42% offer authorization-free access.\nMore than half use some type of data identification system such as DOIs.\nNearly half offer some data processing, with a similar number providing software or tools.\n78.9% request that users cite or acknowledge datasets used and the data center.\nOnly 21.1% recommend specific metadata standards, such as ISO 19115 or Dublin Core, with more than half utilizing a customized metadata scheme.\nInformation was rarely provided on repository certification and accreditation and uneven for transfer of rights and data security.\nFew provided policy information on preservation, migration, reappraisal, disposal, or long-term sustainability.\nAs repository use increases, it will be important for institutions to make their procedures and policies explicit, to build trust with user communities and improve efficiencies in data sharing.

The Servita fault possibly was originated like a suture that derived of a continental collision in Late Mesoproterozoic times when Rodinia was conform totally. The Servita Fault as normal fault in Mesozoic times contributed to the Colombian Cretaceous basin development. In Late Cretaceous because to collision of the Caribbean plate with the northwestern corner of South America a strong compressive stress was occur and kinematics changes were presented in the normal faults restrained to the basin like among others the Servita Fault, where these were converted in inverse faults.

            "abstract": "Cratons are continental nuclei that have been tectonically quiescent for at least a billion years. They show distinct geological and geophysical signatures from younger continental regions. Some Precambrian crustal generation models suggest a change in tectonic processes at the end of the Archean, marking the onset of modern-style plate tectonics and different lithospheric growth mechanisms.\nEastern Canada comprises Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic terranes, recording tectonic events spanning ~3 Ga of Earth history. It is a natural laboratory to test hypotheses concerning craton genesis and Precambrian plate tectonics. To constrain structural variations across this region, a new broadband seismograph network has been deployed from southernmost Hudson Bay to coastal Nova Scotia. The main profile crosses major tectonic boundaries between the Superior craton, the Proterozoic Grenville and Phanerozoic Appalachian provinces.\nA profile of crustal structure across the major tectonic terranes was constructed from transdimensional Bayesian receiver function inversions. 1D structure beneath individual stations is described in terms of two parameters: shear wavespeed variation with depth, and likelihood of discontinuity, both defined probabilistically. A clear Moho can be identified at about 36-42 km with variable transition width. Moreover, a persistent sub-continental lithospheric impedance contrast is detected at 52-57 km beneath most stations. The ubiquity of this feature across a profile spanning 3 Ga of lithospheric processes could imply that post-cratonization chemical modification may have homogenized the uppermost mantle.\nSmall age-dependent variations in mean bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratios are revealed from receiver function H-k stacking: ~1.71, ~1.77 and ~1.75 for the Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic respectively. Crustal thickness also varies systematically with age, with Moho depths of ~35 km for the Archean and Phanerozoic but up to 10 km thicker in some parts of the Proterozoic. These results are consistent with a non-plate tectonic origin for the predominantly felsic and thin Archean crust, as opposed to more mafic Proterozoic terranes with deeper crustal roots that do not reciprocate the low-relief surface topography.",

            "abstract": "We present a statistical method for calibrating the Community Land Model (CLM) using streamflow observations collected between 1999 and 2008 at the outlet of two river basins from the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX), Oostanaula River at Resaca GA, and Walnut River at Winfield KS.. The observed streamflow shows variability over a large range of time-scales, none of which significantly dominates the others; consequently, the time-series seems noisy and is difficult to be directly used in model parameter estimation efforts without significant filtering.\nWe perform a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition of the observed streamflow, and use the wavelet power coefficients (WPC) as the tuning data. We construct a mapping (a surrogate model) between WPC and three hydrological parameters of the CLM using a training set of 256 CLM runs. The dependence of WPC on the parameters is complex and cannot be captured using a surrogate unless the parameter combinations yield physically plausible model predictions, i.e., those that are skillful when compared to observations. Retaining only the top quartile of the runs ensures skillfulness, as measured by the RMS error between observations and CLM predictions. This “screening” of the training data yields a region (the “valid” region) in the parameter space where accurate surrogate models can be created.\nWe construct a classifier for the “valid” region, and, in conjunction with the surrogate models for WPC, pose a Bayesian inverse problem for the three hydrological parameters. The inverse problem is solved using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to construct a three-dimensional posterior distribution for the hydrological parameters. Posterior predictive tests using the surrogate model reveal that the posterior distribution is more predictive than the nominal values of the parameters, which are used as default values in the current version of CLM. The effectiveness of the inversion is then validated by testing the posterior samples by performing real CLM simulations at both sites.",

An integrated geophysical and hydrochemical approach is adopted to study these sand and gravel deposits, which are likely to constitute regional offshore aquifers and hold brackish paleo-waters. Marine seismic reflection profiles from Lantau Island South, are studied to depict the three-dimensional configuration of the subsurface aquifer-aquitard system. Sedimentological evidence and geophysical properties of an offshore vibrocore drilled south of Lantua Island show a three-fold sequence, with two upper marine layers and a lowermost oxidized terrestrial layer. The shifts of depositional environments are attributed to the Holocene sea level rise. Hydrochemical analysis of the porewater from the core samples indicates the presence of brackish water in the lowermost layer and possible diffusion transport. High ammonium levels in porewater and acoustic turbidity in seismic profiles are resulted from biogenic activities. This study provides preliminary information for feasibility study on exploiting submarine waters as an alternative water resource in Hong Kong.",

            "abstract": "NARCliM (NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling Project) is a regional climate project for Australia and surrounding area. It uses dynamical downscaling to provide climate projections for the CORDEX-AustralAsia region at 50 km resolution, and for South-East Australia at 10 km resolution. The project is the first of its kind in the level of sophistication of model selection. Specifically, the selection process for General Circulation Models (GCMs) included (i) evaluating model performance based on literature review, (ii) calculating model independence, and (iii) analyzing future changes in temperature and precipitation. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for downscaling the GCMs were identified based on model independence, as well as on their performance for several precipitation events over South-East Australia.\nWe first present seasonal and annual mean changes for key climate metrics (e.g., temperature, precipitation, etc.) for both regions for periods 2020-2039 and 2060-2079. We then use the seasonal and annual mean output from NARCliM to address several key questions: (1) How independent are the members of the NARCliM ensemble? (2) Do the RCMs span sufficient range of uncertainty in the driving GCM projections? (3) Are the RCMs significantly different from observations? and (4) Over which areas do we expect a significant change in surface atmospheric temperature and precipitation in periods 2020-2039 and 2060-2079? More broadly, we share strategies on overcoming common computational challenges faced during the project with those intending to undertake a similar Regional Climate Modeling effort.",

These data should provide essential clues on the past habitability of Gale crater. Amongst the SAM suite of instruments [1], SAM-GC (Gas Chromatograph) is devoted to identify and quantify volatiles evolved from the thermal (heating up to about 900°C)/chemical (derivatization procedure) treatment of any soil sample collected by the Curiosity rover. With the aim to search for potential organic molecules outgassed from the samples, SAM-GC analytical channels composed of thermal-desorption injector, and a MXT-CLP or a MXT-Q chromatographic column was chosen to achieve all the measurements done up today, with the aim to separate of a wide range of volatile inorganic and organic molecules. Four solid samples have been analyzed with GCMS, one sand sample collected at the Rocknest site, two rock samples (John Klein and Cumberland respectively) collected at the Yellowknife Bay site using the Curiosity driller, and one rock sample collected at the Kimberly site.\nAll the measurements were successful and they produced complex chromatograms with both detectors used for SAM GC, i.e. a thermal conductivity detector and the SAM quandrupole mass spectrometer. Their interpretation already revealed the presence of an oxychlorine phase present in the sample which is at the origin of chlorohydrocarbons clearly identified [2] but this represents only a fraction of the GCMS signal recorded [3,4]. This work presents a systematic comparison of the GCMS measurements done for the different samples collected, supported by reference data obtained in laboratory with different spare models of the gas chromatograph, with the aim to bring new elements of interpretation of the SAM measurements.\n",

Once the convection electric field weakens the outer plasmasphere refills from the ionosphere. Observations at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) show that plasmaspheric ions sometimes refill to number densities in excess of 100 cm-3 within ~48 hours. This observed refilling rate is far in excess of that generally predicted by theoretical models. To study the physics of refilling, a fully-updated version of the SUPIM code is used. We present observations of refilling at GEO alongside a detailed modeling study of the factors governing the refilling process.

            "abstract": "There are many situations that a spacecraft surface would be covered by a layer of dusts, such as that around a comet and and on the surfaces of the Moon and asteroids. Previous studies of surface charging in plasmas have mostly considered a “clean” conducting or dielectric surface. On the other hand, studies of dust charging in plasmas have mostly considered that of single, isolated dust grains (the “dust-in-plasma” condition), where a dust grain is electrically isolated from its neighboring dusts. This paper considers the charging of a surface covered by a layer of dust grains (the “dusty-surface” condition), where the inter-dust distance is almost zero but the dust grains do not form a solid surface. Under such a condition, the sheath of each individual dust particles overlap to form one single sheath and the charging of individual dust grains is strongly affected by that of the neighboring dust grains and the surface.\nExperiments and numerical simulations are carried out to understand the charging of both conducting and dielectric dusty surfaces. Surface charging measurements will be presented for different dust layer thickness, dust grain size, dust density, and different ambient plasma conditions. The effect of the existence of a dusty layer on surface potential as well as the difference between charging of a single dust-in-plasma and that of a dust grain as part of a dusty surface will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Structural geology, strain and kinematics of shearing of the ASRR shear zone are essential in elucidating the nature of shearing along the shear zone and its role in the tectonic evolution of eastern Tibet. This study reports new progress on our understanding the structural geology and tectonic significance of the Yao Shan metamorphic complex (YSMC), the NW extension of the Day Nui Con Voi complex along the ASRR shear zone.\nStructural analysis reveals that the YSMC constitutes a large linear antiform cored by highly sheared Proterozoic high grade rocks. Progressive shearing of the rocks generated early pure and late simple shearing-dominated fabrics at decreasing temperatures. L-fabrics and A-type folds at various scales are characteristic structural elements in the complex. A linear antiform is best outlined by the outer shell Cambrian-Triassic marbles, metabasalt and phyllitic rocks. In addition, these rocks contain shear fabrics consistent with those in the high grade core. The AMS data of 186 specimens from 20 sites along a section across the central YSMC shows generally high anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility implying high shear strain. Most samples possess flattening strain AMS fabrics, in spite of fabrics types of the tectonites. Magnetic foliations due to oriented growth of biotite and magnetite have intersection angles of less than 15° with mylonite foliation (S fabrics), indicating high shear strain. Meanwhile, the intersection suggests that both dextral shearing and sinistral shearing occur across the complex, which is compatible with outcrop and microscopic observations.\nIt is suggested that the Yao Shan-Day Nui Con Voi complex is a linear a-type anticlinal fold formed by crustal scale syn-shearing folding and doming. The present study demonstrates that the Yao Shan-Day Nui Con Voi anticlinal structure was formed as a result of middle and lower crustal flow along the ASRR shear zone in southeastern Tibet during Indian-Eurasian continental collision.",

            "abstract": "The insolation evolution [Laskar 2004] from 4 to 2.5 Ma depicts a series of three summer solstice insolation minima between 2.7 and 2.6 Ma, but there are other more important summer solstice minima notably around 3.82 and 3.05 Ma. On such a time span of more than 1 Ma, data shows that there are variations in the evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration with a local maximum around 3 Ma [Seki et al.2010; Bartoli et al. 2011], before a decrease between 3 and 2.6 Ma. The latter, suggesting an abrupt ice sheet inception around 2.7 Ma, has been shown to be a major culprit for the full Greenland Glaciation [Lunt et al. 2008]. However, a recent study [Contoux et al. 2014, in review] suggests that a lowering of CO2 is not sufficient to initiate a glaciation on Greenland and must be combined to low summer insolation, with surviving ice during insolation maximum, suggesting a cumulative process in the first place, which could further lead to full glaciation at 2.7 Ma.\nThrough a new tri-dimensional interpolation method implemented within the asynchronous coupling between an atmosphere ocean general circulation model (IPSL-CM5A) and an ice sheet model (GRISLI), we investigate the transient evolution of Greenland ice sheet during the Pliocene to diagnose whether the ice sheet inception is an abrupt event or rather a cumulative process, involving waxing and waning of the ice sheet during several orbital cycles.\n",

            "abstract": "Soil water flow in laboratory experiments often presents complexities which include a dynamic behavior indicated by non-equilibrium between water content θ and water potential h which are known as “dynamic effects”. During the last six decades dynamic effects have been observed directly or indirectly as (1) non-uniqueness of the diffusivity vs water content function, (2) the flow rate dependence of the water retention curve, (3) a relaxation in the system-averaged water content in experiments with controlled pressure head boundary conditions and (4) as a relaxation of the pressure head while the flux density and macroscopic water content distribution appear to be constant. Macroscopically, all the observations mentioned above can be described by the following mechanism: Even in well sorted materials there are always some highly conducting pore paths in which the flow is initiated when the boundary condition is changed. This is followed by an equilibration phase during which a relatively small amount of water initially behind the wetting or drying front moves in the major flow direction. This second phase of equilibration is not instantaneous and is responsible for the observed drift in the θ vs h relationship at the REV scale.\nDiamantopoulos et al. (2012) presented a model which describes dynamic effects in the case of Multistep Outflow experiments. They assumed that the water content is macroscopically portioned into two fractions: Water content in one fraction is in equilibrium with the pressure head whereas the equilibration of the water content in the second fraction lags behind. In this work we applied the non-equilibrium model of Diamantopoulos et al. (2012) to the four different observations of dynamic effects in laboratory experiments presented in the literature. Results show that the model predicted nonequilibrium effects very well in all four types of flow experiments.",

The Taiwan orogeny is also accompanied by the opening of the Okinawa Trough. The fold-and-thrust belt in NE Taiwan shows a convex shape. What are the roles of plate indentation and back-arc opening that played in the curvature of the NE Taiwan salient?\nOur paleomagnetic study indicates both a complex pattern of local block rotations characterized by pre- and post-folding magnetizations, and a consistent, homogeneous pattern of magnetic lineations (supported by the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility) which remain parallel to the regional fold axis all along the salient. Such homogeneity of the trends of the structures favors the interpretation of the rotational pattern as a succession of large-scale regional clockwise then local anticlockwise rotations.\nThe pre-collision structure trends corrected by the block rotations in different areas reveals a syn-collision curvature that mimics the current shape of the Central Range and an inherited convex shape only bent significantly at its northern tip. We propose to associate the main clockwise bending of the NE Taiwan salient to the indentation of the Luzon volcanic arc against the Eurasian plate and the anticlockwise \"un-bending\" to the opening of the Okinawa Trough.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) of the Himalaya and the paleogeographic position of the Lhasa terrane within Gondwanaland remain controversial. In the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis, the metamorphic basements of the northern Indian plate (Namche Barwa Group) and the South Lhasa terrane (Nyingchi Complex) can be studied to explore these issues. The youngest ages of detrital zircons in the metasedimentary rocks from the Pai Formation of the Namche Barwa Group (NBG) and the Nyingchi Complex suggest their maximum depositional ages are no older than 942 Ma and 1006 Ma, respectively. A granitic gneiss intruding the Pai Formation and a metarhyolite overlying the Nyingchi Complex have protolith ages of 477 ± 3 Ma and 507 ± 4 Ma, respectively, providing upper age limits for their deposition. The detrital zircons in the Pai Formation and Nyingchi Complex define four major age peaks at ~1170 Ma, ~1350 Ma, ~1565 Ma, and ~1750 Ma. Both the ~1170 Ma and ~1350 Ma zircons have large variation of eHf(t) values (-19.4 to +5.6); most ~1565 Ma zircons have positive eHf(t) values (+1.2 - +9.0), and most ~1750 Ma zircons have negative eHf(t) values (-7.1 to -1.9), which are consistent with those of the Mesoproterozoic orthogneiss in the Duoxiongla migmatite of NBG. The trace-element signatures of ~1.5-1.3 Ga detrital zircons indicate they were derived from sources characterized by bimodal magmatism. The potential sources for the metasediments in the Pai Formation and Nyingchi Complex include the Rayner-Eastern Ghats Orogen and its contact zone with the Archaean Indian cratons, the Central Indian Tectonic Zone, the northeastern India craton and Dharwar craton, South Lhasa terrane and probably Eastern Antarctic. Comparisons of detrital zircon age spectra of the coeval metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex, the Pai Formation, the GHS and upper Lesser Himalayan Sequence in Arunachal Himalayan, and the Indian cratonic successions suggest that: (1) the NBG is the northeastern extension of the GHS in Arunachal Himalaya; (2) their protolithes were deposited along the northern passive margin of the Indian craton; (3) prior to the Cambrian, the South Lhasa terrane was tectonically linked to northern India rather than northwest Australia.",

            "abstract": "Water pollution is a major challenge in large river systems such as the Ganga (i.e. Ganges). With a population of 400 million, widespread agriculture and a heavy industrial base, this river basin is facing multiple stressors and as a result, is now notorious for poor water quality. One of the key issues in addressing this problem remains basic water quality monitoring with systematic and reliable methods. Currently, water quality datasets in the River Ganga are highly fragmented and inadequate for most investigations. Given the sub-continental scale of the system, remote sensing could offer a plausible solution if capable of producing holistic assessments of water quality with a standardised methodology. Specifically, the development of hyperspectral remote sensing, capable of detecting very small changes in incident radiation, offers the potential to mimic laboratory spectroscopy and thus identify the chemicals polluting a body of water, and perhaps, even measure their concentration. However, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing in order to measure water quality is not yet established and remains a very challenging problem.\nIn this study, laboratory experiments, ancillary field data and hyperspectral imagery from the Hyperion sensor were used to explore the feasibility of using remote sensing to detect chromium pollution in the River Ganga. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that field spectroscopy was indeed capable of detecting chromium in concentrations that can currently be found in the Ganga. Furthermore, the analysis of the Hyperion images of the River Ganga shows some promising results which suggest that chromium compounds can be detected using hyperspectral satellite imagery. However, the results confirm that measuring water quality from spaceborne hyperspectral imagery is extremely challenging and further research is required to improve the confidence of these results and refine this methodology.",

            "abstract": "One of the key criteria for successful geological storage of CO2 is that the target reservoir must not leak the stored gases over extended periods. Due to the peculiarity of its geological and geodynamic setting, which results in the production, accumulation, and leakage of large volumes of natural CO2, the Italian peninsula can be used as a natural laboratory as it provides to study gas migration mechanisms in large-scale geological systems, as well as to determine whether and how much sequestered CO2 could hypothetically leak from a subsurface reservoir.\nMoving from west to east, the Italian peninsula includes several geodynamic settings: the Tyrrhenian back arc basin and associated volcanic arcs, the Apennines fold and thrust belt, and the Adriatic foredeep. All of them are characterized by a diffuse and/or massive degassing of deeply derived CO2, which is usually emitted by vents or dissolved and transported by large aquifers. In the volcanic islands, in the south of the Tyrrhenian Sea, large areas are characterized by leakage from the sea floor.\nBased on the statistical and geo-spatial interpretation of more than 40,000 soil gas samples collected in central and southern Italy by the Fluid Chemistry Laboratory of “La Sapienza” University of Rome over more than 30 years of activity, different migration patterns related to the different geodynamic settings are distinguished and described. This very large database has been organised and managed in a GIS environment that allows the calculation of fundamental statistical parameters, the analysis of distribution patterns, the study of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity, and the elaboration of maps. The interpretation of these data allow us to define background values of CO2, strongly related to geological setting, and other minor (CH4) and trace gases (He and Rn), that characterise the different geological scenarios. A common feature is that anomalous gas concentrations occur in restricted zones, both aligned along preferential pathways (i.e. faults and fractures) and/or as spot anomalies. This database and associated studies constitutes a unique tool for studying the various physical and chemical processes involved, as well as for the development of new sampling strategies for site assessment and monitoring of any CO2 geological storage site.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes are geomorphic structures located in ecotone environments such as lagoon and estuaries, providing lot of ecosystem services to local population. In the last decades they are disappearing due to several factors such as sea level rise, subsidence and edge erosion due to surface waves. The latter is likely the chief mechanism modeling marsh boundaries and leading to the loss of wide marsh areas. In the case of the Venice Lagoon, from the beginning of the last century, the whole salt marsh surface has more than halved and trends indicate that the salt marshes might completely disappear over the next 50 years.\nHere, we present a field monitoring activity that we are currently carrying out on a retreating salt marsh located in the north part of the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The marsh is subject to North-East (Bora) wind. Marsh area loss during the last decades has been documented through the comparison of georeferenced aerial photographs showing a retreat rate of the order of 1 m/year.\nField measurements started by the end of November 2013 and consist of: salt marsh bank geometry at different cross-sections and wave climate in the lagoon about 30 m in front of the salt marsh. Erosion data are obtained by means of erosion pins located horizontally on the marsh scarp; at higher banks (about 0.9 m), two pins are located along the same vertical direction, for lower banks (about 0.4m), only one pin is employed. Significant wave height has been measured during three storm surges by means of pressure transducers (Pts).\nThe measured wave climate in front of the bank was then put into relationship with the offshore wave climate estimated using wind data (intensity and direction) and bathymetric data. Wind intensity and direction is measured hourly by several measurement stations located in the Lagoon of Venice. In this way, it is possible to extrapolate wave climate hourly at the monitored marsh and calculate the wave power that acted on the bank in a given time interval.\nField survey revealed that the main retreating mechanisms are particle by particle erosion alternated to cantilever failures. Preliminary results show a linear relationship between erosion rate and wave energy flux and the existence of a critical threshold for the onset of erosion.",

            "abstract": "In the last decades different studies have addressed short-term earthquake precursors by focusing on the observation of a wide variety of physical phenomena that can precede strong earthquakes. This includes anomalous seismicity patterns, ground water level changes, gas emissions, geochemical changes in groundwater, seismo-electromagnetic phenomena, seismo-ionospheric coupling, surface deformations etc. Some cases of the potential precursors observed in the past where later found as an artifact of sensor-system malfunctioning. Therefore, such monitoring needs to be long-term, time-stamped and continuous, with a professional quality assurance procedure. Moreover, it is important to correlate data recorded with multi-sensor systems. We present a case study of running a multi-sensor system in Valais, Switzerland. The Valais is the area of highest seismic hazard in Switzerland and has experienced a magnitude 6 or larger event every 100 years on average. The system consists of seismic, geodetic (GPS), geochemical and geomagnetic instruments. Here we focus on the latter two. In particular, the observation of possible geochemical earthquake precursory signals is carried out by the installation of two instruments: 1) field fluorometer for monitoring of the fluorescence spectral analysis of water, which can monitor 3 different wavelength bands, temperature and turbidity; 2) geochemical gas concentration sensors, which monitor radon, CO2, and CH4 gases. The geomagnetic observations are performed by three component coil magnetometers. All instrument are designed to run in continuous mode and stream data in real-time. In this presentation we focus mainly on operational aspects of such system. We discuss problems faced during operation, feasibility of the installation, and in general lessons learned for potential future applications.",

            "abstract": "The aggradation and progradation of deltaic plains over stratigraphically relevant (centennial to millennial) timescales is not well constrained, largely due to the difficulty to directly date clastic strata. Here we address this problem by means of ~50 new OSL ages from the late Holocene Mississippi Delta. We focus on the Lafourche subdelta, a precursor of the modern Mississippi River that was active from ~1500 to 600 years ago and built a land area of ~10,000 km2. The upstream reach of this system (~50 km in length) exhibits widespread aggradation by means of crevasse splays that is highly episodic in nature. The fluviodeltaic stratigraphic record at any given locality within this reach consists of a patch work of discrete, autogenic sediment bodies, with century-scale aggradation rates typically ~1 to 4 cm/yr. Sand accounts for only ~5% within these overbank strata. Hence, inland crevasse splays are extremely efficient at trapping muddy overbank sediment, with a retention rate conservatively estimated at >60%. We attribute this to the fact that aggradation occurred within a swamp, where vegetation-induced roughness enhanced the settling of the fine grain-size fractions.\nIn contrast, the lowermost ~100 km of the Lafourche subdelta formed by progradation into shallow open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The stratigraphy within this reach is substantially different and features mouth-bar sheet sands ~2-4 m in thickness, similar to the modern Wax Lake Delta. These mouth bars are draped by mud-dominated overbank deposits that thin in a seaward direction, likely due to the shorter time span of aggradation in the lowermost reaches. OSL dating of the mouth-bar sands enables us to quantify the progradation rate of the shoreline. Collectively, the new chronological constraints on aggradation and progradation rates have implications for the potential rates of wetland creation by proposed river diversions along the modern Mississippi River.",

It is testing the Stern-Bloomer hypothesis that subduction initiation (SI) was followed by a strongly extensional period of slab sinking and trench roll-back and then by a transitional period leading to the establishment of significant slab-parallel plate motion and hence normal subduction. The Expedition aims to carry out offset drilling at two sites near 28°30’N in the Bonin forearc. Ideally, these together will give the vertical volcanic stratigraphy needed to trace the geodynamic and petrogenetic processes associated with SI, and provide the complete reference section required for comparison with volcanic sequences of possible SI origin found on land in ophiolite complexes and elsewhere. We predict, but need to confirm, a c. 1.0-1.5km sequence with basal, MORB-like forearc basalts (known as FAB) marking the initial period of extension, boninites characterizing the transitional period, and tholeiitic and calc-alkaline lavas marking the establishment of normal arc volcanism. Study of such a sequence will enable us to understand the chemical gradients within and across these volcanic units, to reconstruct mantle flow and melting processes during the course of SI, and to test the hypothesis that fore-arc lithosphere created during SI is the birthplace of most supra-subduction zone ophiolites. Here, we present the first Expedition results, including (a) the volcanic stratigraphic record and subdivision into lava units, (b) the classifications and interpretations made possible by shipboard (portable XRF and ICP) analyses and down-hole measurements, and (c) the biostratigraphic, magnetic, mineralogical, sedimentary and structural constraints on the geological history of the SI section and the interactions between magmatic, hydrothermal and tectonic activity during its evolution.",

            "abstract": "The Andes constitute one of the most important orographic barriers in the S hemisphere, which impacts atmospheric circulation, the amount and distribution of rainfall, and resulting surface processes. In the central Andes of Argentina the orogenic Puna Plateau and the intermontane basins within the adjacent Eastern Cordillera (EC) constitute archives that furnish spatiotemporal information on the uplift of the orogen and ensuing paleoenvironmental changes. Presently, rainfall in NW Argentina is focused along the windward flanks of the EC, while its intermontane basins and the Puna constitute high-elevation regions with decreasing rainfall and steep topographic gradients. The influence of topography on hydrologic conditions is reflected in the stable isotopic composition of meteoric water. Importantly, in light of these systematic present-day isotope characteristics, proxy materials retrieved from basin strata may record analogous conditions in the past and provide insight concerning topographic growth through time. Here, we present isotopic data of volcanic glass (δDg), extracted from volcanic ash deposits interbedded with strata in different sedimentary basins across the E flank of the plateau. Combined with geochronology, our data show clear spatiotemporal variations in δDg within the different basins that are correlated with regional topographic growth and associated orographic effects during the Mio-Pliocene. For example, the Humahuaca basin (23.5°S) shows a gradual δDg-decrease that documents uplift of the basin catchment and possibly enhanced rainout along a paleo-Andean front, followed by a strong shift towards modern δDg values (–100‰) after 3 Ma, associated with aridification due to range uplift and orographic shielding to the E. In the Angastaco basin (25.5°S), δDg is more variable prior to 3.5 Ma (–70 to –95‰). Conditions similar to today (–65‰) were established by at least 1 Ma. Isotopic and sedimentologic data from the Toro basin (24.5°S) suggest a similar pattern, indicating topographic growth along the E Andean front. Isotope data from the broken foreland to the east seem unaffected by large isotopic shifts, which may ultimately help to reconstruct relative elevation changes across the Andes to better understand the topographic evolution of the orogen interior.",

            "abstract": "Earth deserts show a rich variety of dune shapes from transverse to barchan, star and linear dunes depending on the history of wind regimes (strength and variability) and sand availability [1]. In desert, exposed to one wind direction, dunes perpendicular to the wind direction are found to be transverse or barchans, only sand availability plays a key role on their formation and evolution. However, the evolution time scale of such structures (several years) limits our investigation of their morphodynamics understanding. We use here, a laboratory experiment able to considerably reduce space and time scales by reproducing millimeter to centimeter subaqueous dunes by controlling environmental parameters such as type of wind (multi-winds, bimodal, quasi-bimodal or unidirectional wind) and amount of sediment [2,3]. This set up allows us to characterize more precisely the different modes of dune formation and long-term evolution, and to constrain the physics behind the morphogenesis and dynamics of dunes. Indeed, the formation, evolution and transition between the different dune modes are better understood and quantified thanks to a new setting experiment able to give a remote sediment source in continuous (closer to what happens in terrestrial desert): a sand distributor that controls the input sand flow. Firstly, in a one wind direction conditions, we managed to follow and quantify the growth of the instability of transverse dunes that break into barchans when the sand supply is low and reversely when the sand supply is higher, barchan fields evolve to bars dunes ending to form transverse. The next step will be to perform experiments under two winds conditions in order to better constrain the formation mode of linear dunes, depending also only on the input sand flux. Previous experiments shown that linear “finger” dunes can be triggered by the break of transverse dunes and then the elongating of one barchan’s arm [4].\nThese studies can farther explain more precisely in different wind history and sand supply, these patterns state that should emerge and, by applying the relevant scale law, to apply this laboratory work to terrestrial and planetary (Mars and Titan) desert dynamics.\n[1] Bagnold R.A.

ALOS-2 science program initiates the JAXA’s Calibration, Validation, Application researches of the PALSAR-2/ALOS-2 and Pi-SAR-L2. As the application research, the disaster mitigation and the urban area monitoring using the high-resolution data should contribute significantly to the human society since the disasters occur frequently and globally. High resolution and multi polarimetric SAR with the shorter revisit time reserves the quicker detection of the land changes.

            "abstract": "Bedrock geology, climate and time are important controls on chemical weathering and release of dissolved silica. Forested land vs. other land uses was recently hypothesized as another control. The Finger Lakes region is an ideal natural laboratory to test this hypothesis as local watersheds vary in area, bedrock and agricultural to forested land cover in this rural setting.\nAnnual mean dissolved silica data from 11 watersheds in our ongoing monitoring program ranged from 100 to 4,000 μg/L Si, analyzing filtered (0.45 μm) samples by spectrophotometer (molybdate indicator with metol/oxalic acid reagents). Like earlier work, only forested land use (12 to 73%) correlated to the mean silica concentrations (r2 = 0.3), which improves (r2 = 0.6) when a small, primarily (24%) developed watershed is excluded from the correlation. Bedrock (Devonian carbonates, 0 to 8% and clastics, 0 to 99% covered by till) and basin area (10 to 500 km2) did not correlate (r2 <= 0.1). Event and base flow samples of an agricultural (64%) watershed revealed peak to base flow fluctuations in silica concentrations that more closely mimic nitrates and other groundwater solutes than suspended particles, phosphates and other runoff signature parameters.\nAnnual mean epilimnion and hypolimnion dissolved silica data from the 8 easternmost Finger Lakes in our ongoing monitoring program ranged from 250 to 1,500 μg/L Si. Forested cover (30 to 75%) positively correlated to epilimnion silica concentrations (r2 = 0.6). Lake water residence time (1 to 17 yr) negatively correlated to hypolimnion silica concentrations (r2 = 0.5). Agricultural land use, bedrock, and productivity indicators (chlorophyll-a, total phosphate, and secchi disk depth) lacked correlation (r2 <= 0.1). It suggested that land use impacts stream and, surprisingly, lake dissolved silica chemistry. Biogeochemical processes in the lakes like diatom uptake appears to increasingly decrease silica concentrations in lakes with longer residence times.",

            "abstract": "This work explains the sedimentation history and environment and climate changes during the Holocene along the southwest coast of India. The area is characterized by various landforms such as lagoons, barrier islands, beach ridges, paleostrandlines, alluvial plains, marshy lands and flood plains. Paleodelta, located at the mouth of the modern Periyar River is an important geomorphic marker.\nA borehole of 40 m depth was drilled in the paleodelta and sediment samples were recovered at different depth intervals. Paleoclimate and paleo-environment were inferred based on geochronology, textural and geotechnical parameters, clay minerals, and pollen analysis results.\nThe bottom of the borehole represents an age of ~ 12 ka BP. Sediments exhibit coarsening texture upwards of the borehole, with fine mud and peat intercalations at the bottom. Six litho facies - muddy sand, sand, sandy mud, silty sand, sandy silt, and mud - were recorded. Geotechnical properties comprising moisture content, organic carbon, plasticity index record high values, whereas low bulk density associated with a low critical shear stress, are recorded. An increase in illite and to a lesser degree smectite with concomitant decrease in kaolinite is observed.\nSediment texture represents a major change of depositional environment from marine to fluvial sedimentary facies during the major sea level fall i.e., after 7 ka B.P. The present sea level attained during 4-5 ka B.P; major rise of sea level has taken place from 7-11 ka BP and regression during 7 – 5 ka B.P. These transgression and regression phases introduced the changes in the environment of deposition. The monsoon was dynamic and more intense after the major fall of sea level causing the fluctuations in the fluvial facies. Upward coarsening of grain size in the borehole indicates change in sediment deposition due to increased hydrodynamic conditions and strong fluvial action, which can be linked to marine regression. Geotechnical properties suggest textural changes and sedimentary facies. An upward increase in smectite and kaolinite and decreasing illite supports major fall in sea level and also the aridity. Pollen record of sediment strata supports the paleo-environment dominated by the presence of semi-evergreen type of mangrove plants during mid- to early-Holocene times.",

            "abstract": "Since the mid-Pliocene, East Asian climates have experienced significant changes. One view suggests that significant uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during this period could have been responsible for these dramatic changes in the strength of the East Asian monsoon and for Asian interior aridification, while some other authors attribute these changes to the ongoing global cooling and rapid growth of the Arctic ice-sheet. Up to the present, which factor dominates the major changes of East Asian climate in the mid-Pliocene is still a contentious issue. This study presents an analysis of several climate proxies including magnetic susceptibility, grain-size, (CaO*+Na2O+MgO)/TiO2 ratio, Na/Ka ratio, Fe flux, and dust accumulation rates of the Xifeng Red Clay sequence in the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau and the Xihe Pliocene loess-soil sequence in West Qinling. They reveal that aridity in the continental interior and winter monsoon circulation both intensified, whereas the East Asian summer monsoon showed a weakening rather than intensifying trend since the mid-Pliocene. These changes are also supported by the other multi-proxy records from various regions in East Asia. Previous numerical modeling studies have demonstrated that uplift of the Tibetan Plateau would have simultaneously enhanced continental-scale summer and winter monsoon strength as well as central Asian aridity. The mid-Pliocene climate changes in East Asia are therefore unlikely to be a response to Plateau uplift. On the contrary, our recent modeling results give support to the view that ongoing cooling could have intensified both the aridity of the interior and the strength of the winter monsoon, but weakened the summer monsoon in East Asia.",

            "abstract": "An overwhelming scientific consensus exists on the issue of anthropogenic climate change. Unfortunately, public perception of expert agreement remains low- only around 1 in 10 Americans correctly estimates the actual level of consensus on the topic. Moreover, several recent studies have demonstrated the pivotal role that perceived consensus plays in the public's acceptance of key scientific facts about environmental problems, as well as their willingness to support policy to address them. This \"consensus gap\", between the high level of scientific agreement vs. the public's perception of it, has led to calls for increased consensus messaging. However this call has been challenged by a number of different groups: climate \"skeptics\" in denial about the existence and validity of the consensus; some social science researchers and journalists who believe that such messages will be ineffective or counterproductive; and even some scientists and science advocates who downplay the value of consensus in science generally. All of these concerns can be addressed by effectively communicating the role of consensus within science to the public, as well as the conditions under which consensus is likely to be correct. Here, we demonstrate that the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change satisfies these conditions, and discuss past examples of purported consensus that failed or succeeded to satisfy them as well. We conclude by discussing the way in which scientific consensus is interpreted by the public, and how consensus messaging can improve climate literacy.",

These reanalyses have been repackaged to adhere to the CMIP5 standards and published on the ESGF. Reanalysis centers provide interfaces to the various reanalyses, but each data set requires some effort to either compare with other reanalyses or with atmospheric model output. The repackaging for ESGF required reformatting, restructuring and modifications to the metadata to facilitate the ESGF search capabilities. Once this was done, the data structure is the same as used by the very successful CMIP3 and CMIP5 making comparison among reanalyses and climate models a relatively easy exercise. The data can now be accessed using WGET, OPENDAP, or HTTPServer at\nhttps://earthsystemcog.org/projects/ana4mips/\n.\nAn example using this interface will be shown including comparison of the reanalyses portrayal of the surface heat balance during the 2010 Russian heat wave. We have found that although the difference reanalyses produce very similar atmospheric features of the heat wave, the surface energy balance terms such as latent and sensible heat show considerable differences. This comparison helps point out systematic differences in the reanalyses surface moisture and may lead to a better understanding of the differences.",

            "abstract": "We present a new 3-D P-wave velocity model of the upper mantle under eastern Tibet determined from 113,831 high-quality teleseismic arrival-time data. Our data are hand-picked from seismograms of 784 teleseismic events (30o-90o) with magnitudes of 5.2 or greater. These events were recorded by 21 portable seismic stations deployed in Yunnan during April 2010 to July 2011 and 259 permanent stations of Chinese provincial seismic networks during September 2008 to December 2011 in the study region. Our results provide new insights into the mantle structure and dynamics of eastern Tibet. High-velocity (high-V) anomalies are revealed down to 200 km depth under stable cratonic regions, such as Sichuan basin, Ordos and Alashan blocks. Prominent low-velocity (low-V) anomalies are revealed in the upper mantle under the Kunlun-Qinling fold zone, Songpan-Ganzi, Qiangtang, Lahsa, and Chuan-Dian diamond blocks, suggesting that the eastward moving low-V materials are obstructed by Sichuan basin, Ordos and Alashan blocks, and they could be extruded through the Qinling fold zone and the Chuan-Dian block to eastern China. In addition, the extent and thickness of these low-V anomalies are well correlated with the surface topography, suggesting that uplift of eastern Tibet is closely related to the low-V anomalies which may reflect hot materials and have strong buoyancy. In the mantle transition zone, broad high-V anomalies are visible from the Burma arc northward to the Kunlun fault and eastward to the Xiaojiang fault, which extend for a total of approximately 700 km. The high-V anomalies are connected upward to the Wadati-Benioff seismic zone beneath the Burma arc. These results suggest that the Indian slab has subducted horizontally for a long distance in the mantle transition zone after it descended into the mantle, and its deep dehydration has contributed to forming the low-V anomalies in the big mantle wedge above the slab. Our present results shed new light on the formation and evolution of the Tibetan plateau.",

Using Reimei and SAMPEX satellite data, we investigate characteristics of the pulsating aurora electrons and relativistic electron microbursts. Reimei satellite reveals that the pulsating aurora is caused by repetition of tens keV electrons and the internal modulations with a few Hz exist inside the precipitation. Beside intermittent precipitations of a few keV electrons, the stable precipitation of low energy electron ~1 keV is simultaneously observed. SAMPEX satellite confirmed the pulsation of relativistic electron microbursts and the internal modulations embedded in the microburst. We simulate the pitch angle scattering of energetic electrons from ten keV to ~1 MeV, considering the propagation of whistler mode waves along the field line. The simulation shows that the pulsation and internal modulations of electrons are caused by the repetition of chorus bursts and rising tones, respectively, and those are commonly observed in both ten keV electrons (pulsating aurora) and relativistic electron microbursts. Upper band chorus waves cause the stable low energy electron precipitations. The results indicate that the propagating whistler mode chorus waves are the common process to cause both pulsating aurora and relativistic electron microbursts along the field line.",

Among the two dozens of seamounts that can be identified with ease on multi-beam bathymetry data, about half of them are located along the fossil spreading ridge while the remaining located off axis. The distribution of off-axis seamounts also shows strong asymmetry about the fossil spreading ridge with a much greater population of seamounts concentrated in the northern basin. The shape of individual seamounts is approximated as elliptical cones to yield best-fitting models: the population of seamounts in the SCS has an average major-axis length of 21 km (standard deviation σ = 8.3 km) and an average minor-axis length of 14 km (σ = 5.3 km); The above-seafloor height and volume of the seamounts have average value of 2.9 km (σ = 1.1 km) and 1.21*1012 m3 (σ = 0.99*1012 m3), respectively. However, limited seismic reflection data show that when the parts of the seamounts buried in the sediment are considered, the resulting estimations of the seamount dimension and volume would increase significantly. Overall, seamounts located on the fossil ridge in the East Subbasin have larger dimension and volume than those in the Southwest Subbasin, except for a seamount neat the Zhongnan Fault between the two subbasins. Adjacent seamounts on the fossil ridge have an average separation distance of 53 km (σ = 9.4 km). We are currently investing lithospheric and mantle melting mechanisms that might control the observed characteristics of the spatial distribution and dimension of seamounts in the SCS.\nKeywords: the South China Sea, fossil spreading ridge, seamounts",

            "abstract": "The widely distributed Late Mesozoic igneous events in North China have been intensively studied in the past decades and proposed to be accounted by lithospheric thinning. However, mechanism of the lithospheric thining is still in debate. In this study, we report U-Pb zircon ages, geochemical data and Sr-Nd isotopic data for the Cretaceous mafic and associated felsic intrusions from the middle Sulu orogenic belt in the Shandong Peninsula. The ICP-MS U-Pb zircon analyses show consistent crystallization ages ranging from 120.2 ± 2.1 Ma to 123.3 ± 1.6 Ma for four representative samples. These rocks are characterized by LREE and LILE enrichment, HREE depletion, high initial 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.70401 to 0.70966, low negative εNd(t) values from -22.0 to -12.2. These features suggest that they were derived from a common enriched lithospheric mantle source. Geochemical and isotopic data indicate that the original magma of these rocks was produced by partial melting of an ancient lithospheric mantle, which was variably mixed with lower crustal eclogite derived melts. The lamprophyres, andesitic porphyrites and syenogranite may have been attributed to subsequent fractional crystallization of olivine and pyroxene, whereas the rhyolite resulted from K-feldspar and plagioclase fractionation, without any crustal contamination affection. Tectonically, the petrogenesis process of these rocks favors an intense lithospheric extensional regime beneath the Sulu orogenic belt at 120 ~ 124 Ma, which was resulted by the widespread removal of the upper mantle and lower crust that driven by the abrupt change of the subducting direction of the Pacific plate.",

Climate change may also modify discharge of the river Weser flowing into the German Bight, which will alter both water levels and salinity distributions along the coast. To study the long-term effects of sea level rise and discharge variations to the salinity distribution, a 3D seawater intrusion model was designed using the fully coupled surface-subsurface numerical model HydroGeoSphere. The model simulates the coastal aquifer as an integral system considering complexities such as variable-density groundwater flow, surface-subsurface interaction, irregular land topography and anthropogenic structures (e.g. dykes, drainage canals, water gates). Using PEST, steady state groundwater flow of year 2009 is calibrated. In addition, 3 climate change scenarios are simulated based on the calibrated model: (i) sea level rise of 1 m, (ii) the salinity of the seaside boundary increased by 25 %, and (iii) the salinity of the seaside boundary decreased by 70 %. Results demonstrate the changes of fresh groundwater resources, surface water depths and salinity distribution. The obtained results are useful for coastal engineering practices, drinking water resources management and for the development of climate change adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Urban microclimate plays an important role in urban water use, energy use, pollutant transport, and the general comfort and well-being of urban inhabitants. The microclimate interacts locally with urban morphology, water levels, properties of urban surfaces, and vegetation cover all of which contribute significantly to the strong spatial variability observed in urban areas. Considerable parts of urban open spaces take the form of street canyons. These urban street canyons play a remarkable role in creating urban microclimates. Within street canyons themselves, a wide variety of phenomena contribute to complex flow patterns. These include various flow structures such as wake fields, circulation zones, isolated roughness flow, wake interference and skimming flows. In addition, heat fluxes from the buildings and the surrounding area enhance the complexity of the flow field inside the canyon. Here, we introduce Uintah:MPMICE for the simulation of fluid structure interactions in urban flows. Uintah:MPMICE has been developed in a massively parallel computational infrastructure, uses material points to represent buildings, and the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique to represent momentum and scalar transport. To validate Uintah:MPMICE, simulations of typical street canyons are compared against published wind tunnel particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) data for the cases of step-up and step-down street canyons. Our findings show promising results in capturing major flow features, namely wake fields, recirculation zones, wake interference, vortex structures, and flow separation in street canyons. LES results demonstrate the ability of the simulations to predict flow topology details such as secondary circulation zones and wall-originating elevated shear layers in step-up and step-down cases, respectively. Furthermore, mean flow and variance statistics indicate sensitivity to inlet boundary conditions; upstream turbulence generation method, in particular, has a significant impact on the LES results.",

We report observations of the same magnetic cloud made by the MESSENGER spacecraft at Mercury (then at 0.44 AU) and later by STEREO-B at 1.09 AU, while the two spacecraft were radially aligned in November 2011. Observation with two radially aligned spacecraft allows sampling of approximately the same region of a magnetic cloud, and so allows any evolution that may have occurred within that region during propagation between the two spacecraft to be determined. The flux rope within the November 2011 cloud has been analysed using force-free fitting and minimum variance analysis: it has been estimated that the rope axis rotated from an inclination of approximately 25° relative to the solar equatorial plane at MESSENGER to lie within a few degrees of the plane at STEREO-B. We investigate the hypothesis that this rotation and alignment with the solar equatorial plane is driven by interactions of the cloud with the heliospheric current sheet.",

            "abstract": "Integrating geodetic measurements from both ground based and satellite observations is crucial to improved monitoring and evaluation of volcanic hazards in Iceland. The focus of our deformation team is to generate and interpret an extended time series of high resolution deformation measurements derived from InSAR and GPS observations, in the vicinity of the most active volcanoes in Iceland: including Hekla, Katla, Eyjafjallajökull and Askja. A comprehensive network of ground-based deformation monitoring equipment is already deployed at several of these volcanoes and a series of campaign GPS measurements are routinely undertaken each summer. InSAR observations are complementary to these field based measurements and their high spatial resolution assists in resolving the geometry and location of the source of the deformation.\nIceland has recently been declared a Permanent Geohazard Supersite by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites, based on its propensity for relatively frequent eruptions and their potentially hazardous, long ranging effects. The recent Supersite award ensures a considerable amount of SAR data is made available for both past and future satellite acquisitions, including new X-band images (acquired by TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites), and historic C-band images (from ERS and ENVISAT satellites). We present long-term deformation time-series spanning > 20 years for Hekla, Katla, Eyjafjallajökull and Askja volcanoes, based on a variety of geodetic techniques including InSAR, GPS and tilt measurements.\nInSAR and tilt measurements at Hekla indicate renewed melt supply to a sub-volcanic reservoir after the last eruption in 2000. Although InSAR and GPS observations at Katla volcano (between 2001 and 2009) suggest no indication of magma induced deformation outside the ice-cap, it is possible that a small flood at Mýrdalsjökull in July 2011, followed by an increase in micro-seismic earthquakes, was related to magmatic activity. Post-eruption deformation observations reveal inflation at Eyjafjallajökull, possibly related to the influx of new melt or readjustment of crustal stresses following the 2010 eruption. Continued deflation at Askja caldera since 1983 may have contributed to crustal weakening and the triggering of a major rockslide and tsunami on the 21 July, 2014.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimatic studies often use stratigraphic changes in the oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) of lacustrine carbonate to infer changes in water temperature and/or the δ18O of lake water. To better understand the environmental factors that influence the isotopic composition of lacustrine carbonates and the assumptions that need to be made to infer past changes in climate, we undertook a four-year study of the water chemistry and sediment trap material in Seneca Lake (NY, USA), a large, monomictic, glacial, hardwater lake. Sediment trap material collected weekly between May 2009 and 2013 together with isotopic monitoring of surface and bottom water allow for analysis of the controls on calcite precipitation in the lake. We show that calcite mainly accumulates in traps July through September when the lake water column is stratified and epilimnetic water temperature exceeds 20°C. Up to ~70% of the sediment is comprised of calcite during summer and only ~10% of the sediment is calcite during autumn, winter, and spring. The δ18O of Seneca Lake epilimnetic water varies by only ~0.6 ‰ throughout the year whereas the δ18O of bulk carbonate varies by as much as 2.4‰. As calcite precipitates in the eplimnion, the δ18O declines. Likely due to the large volume and residence time of water, the δ18O of Seneca Lake water appears to track changes in temperature. Our temperature reconstruction using the δ18O of calcite and epilimnetic lake water reveals that calcite was a reasonable proxy for lake surface temperature from July through September. During the remainder of the year, reconstructed temperatures exceed actual temperatures by as much as 18°C. Sediment resuspension (including calcite) during isothermal conditions may explain why calcite is a poor predictor of lake surface temperature in late autumn though spring. The δ18O of calcite in this lake records summer temperatures rather than year-round conditions.",

            "abstract": "Recent development in modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition includes the explicit incorporation of enzyme and microbial dynamics. A characteristic of these models is a feedback between substrate and consumers which is absent in traditional first order decay models. Second, microbial decomposition models incorporate carbon use efficiency (CUE) as a function of temperature which proved to be critical to prediction of SOC with warming. Our main goal is to explore microbial decomposition models with respect to responses of microbes to enzyme activity, costs to enzyme production, and to incorporation of growth vs. maintenance respiration. In order to simplify the modeling setup we assumed quick adjustment of enzyme activity and depolymerized carbon to microbial and SOC pools. Enzyme activity plays an important role to decomposition if its production is scaled to microbial biomass. In fact if microbes are allowed to optimize enzyme productivity the microbial enzyme model becomes unstable. Thus if the assumption of enzyme productivity is relaxed, other limiting factors must come into play. To stabilize the model, we account for two feedbacks that include cost of enzyme production and diminishing return of depolymerization with increasing enzyme concentration and activity. These feedback mechanisms caused the model to behave in a similar way to traditional, first order decay models. Most importantly, we found, that under warming, the changes in SOC carbon were more severe in enzyme synthesis is costly. In turn, carbon use efficiency (CUE) and its dynamical response to temperature is mainly determined by 1) the rate of turnover of microbes 2) the partitioning of dead microbial matter into different quality pools, and 3) and whether growth, maintenance respiration and microbial death rate have distinct responses to changes in temperature.\nAbbreviations: p: decay of enzyme, g: coefficient for growth respiration, : fraction of material from microbial turnover that enters the DOC pool, loss of C scaled to microbial mass, half saturation constant.",

            "abstract": "In the present neither Mars nor Venus has Earth-like plate tectonics, though both are likely still volcanically active. Volcanism on Mars and Venus most resembles intra-plate volcanism on Earth, where magmatism occurs through intact lithospheric plates, away from plate boundaries. On Earth intra-plate magmatism has long been proposed to be the result of lithospheric thinning through delamination or ductile dripping. Exactly how these processes create volcanism, however, has remained obscure; particularly in the case of ductile dripping, which does not produce significant topography in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.\nThough its fall may not trigger significant asthenospheric upwelling, the sinking drip itself will heat conductively as it enters the asthenosphere, and may itself melt, depending upon its solidus temperature and the temperature of the asthenosphere. We refer to this as “drip magmatism,” following the hypothesis of Elkins-Tanton (2007). This model produces testable predictions for the resulting magmatic compositions. Drip magmatism was tested by Ducea (2013) for the Altiplano Plateau in the central Andes, by Holbig and Grove (2008) for magmas from Tibet, by Elkins-Tanton (2014) for the Sierra Nevada, and by Furman et al. (2014) for the central African rift; geochemistry in all these localities confirm drip magmatism.\nDrip magmatism provides a quantifiable mechanism for slow but regular recycling of volatiles into a planetary atmosphere. Further, it could be driven primarily by carbon, or halogens, or other incompatible and volatile elements, in addition to water. Thus, volcanism on one-plate planets, or during a putative “hot” or “slow” tectonics phase on the early Earth, may provide sufficient volatile recycling for habitability.",

            "abstract": "The Parana Magmatic Province (PMP) is one of the largest continental igneous provinces (LIP) on Earth. It is well dated at 133 Ma preceding the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, but the causative geodynamic processes are still poorly understood. Although a low-velocity anomaly has been imaged by seismic tomography in the northeast region of the PMP and interpreted as a fossil conduct of a mantle plume that is related to the flood basalt eruptions, geochemical data indicate that such magmatism is caused by the melting of a heterogeneous and enriched lithospheric mantle with no deep plume participation.\nModels of density perturbations in the upper mantle estimated from joint inversion of geoid anomalies and P-wave delay times will offer important constraints on mantle dynamics.\nA new generation of accurate global geopotential models derived from satellite-missions (e.g. GRACE, GOCE) allows us to estimate density distribution within the Earth from geoid inversion. In order to obtain the residual geoid anomaly related to the density structure of the mantle, we use the EGM2008 model removing estimated geoid perturbations owing to variations in crustal structure (i.e., topographical masses, Moho depth, thickness of sediments and basalts).\nUsing a spherical-Earth approximation, the density model space is represented by a set of tesseroids and the velocity model is parameterized in nodes of a spherical grid where cubic B-splines are utilized as an interpolation function. To constrain the density inversion, we add more than 10,000 manually picked teleseismic P-wave delay times. During the inversion procedure, density and P-wave velocity are linked through the optimization of a constant linear factor correlating density and velocity perturbation. Such optimization will be performed using a probability density function (PDF) [Tarantola, 2005].\nWe will present the preliminary results of this joint inversion scheme and hypothesize on the geodynamic processes responsible for the flood basalt eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Most rock-forming silicates are substitutional solid solutions. Over the years extensive research has been done to determine their structural and crystal chemical properties. Here, the distribution of cations, or order-disorder behavior, is of central importance. In the case of aluminosilicate garnet solid solutions (X3Al2Si3O12 with X = Mg, Fe2+, Mn2+ and Ca) it has been shown that both synthetic and natural crystals have random long-range X-cation disorder in space group Ia-3d, as given by X-ray single-crystal diffraction measurements. However, the structural state of natural garnets at the local scale is not known.\nGarnet from a grospydite xenolith from the Roberts Victor kimberlite, South Africa, was studied by 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. The research thrust was placed on measuring and analyzing paramagnetically shifted resonances to determine the local (short range) structural state of the X-cations in a grossular-rich ternary aluminosilicate garnet solid solution. The garnet crystals are compositionally homogeneous based on microprobe analysis, showing no measurable zoning, and have the formula Grs46.7Prp30.0Alm23.3. The garnet is cubic with the standard garnet space group Ia-3d.\nThe 27Al MAS NMR spectrum shows a very broad asymmetric resonance located between about 100 and -50 ppm. It consists of a number of individual overlapping paramagnetically shifted resonances, which are difficult to analyze quantitatively. The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum, showing better resolution, has two observable resonances termed S0 and S4. S0 is located between about -60 ppm and -160 ppm and S4 is centered at roughly 95 ppm. Both S0 and S4 are composite resonances in nature containing many overlapping individual peaks. S0 contains information on local cation configurations whereby an isolated SiO4 group in the garnet structure does not have an edge-shared Fe2+-containing dodecahedron. S4 involves local configurations where there is one edge-shared dodecahedron containing Fe2+. The measured intensity of the resonances S0 and S4 are roughly similar to calculated intensities assuming random cation mixing. These first results do not indicate any overt short-range cation order in grossular-rich grospydite garnet.",

            "abstract": "As the climate at high latitudes continues to warm, permafrost is becoming increasingly vulnerable to thaw, particularly in the zone of discontinuous permafrost where mean annual air temperatures hover close to zero. Permafrost thaw has dramatic consequences on local hydrology, ecology, and the carbon (C) balance of these ecosystems. The degree to which permafrost peatlands become C sources or sinks following permafrost thaw remains a topic of much debate, owing to the difficulty in accurately dating cores from collapse-scar bogs and in understanding the vulnerability of the formerly forested peat to decomposition immediately following thaw and inundation. Here we use a combination of a chronosequence, paleoenvironmental, and modeling approaches from a permafrost peat plateau interspersed with collapse-scar bogs in Interior Alaska to address how C storage is impacted on timescales from decades to millennia following permafrost thaw. Our initial results indicate that C stocks are lowest in young (years to decades) and intermediate (decades to centuries) collapse-scar bogs, but that net C stocks in old (centuries to millennia) bogs can be as high as in permafrost plateaus. Thawed forested plateau peat is subject to rapid decomposition in the years to decades following thaw, but that rate of loss slows over time. We hypothesize that this is because the labile C pool is preferentially consumed and quickly exhausted by soil microbes. Meanwhile, post-thaw collapse-scar bog peat accumulates rapidly at the surface, and our data show that on longer centennial to millennial timescales, this near-surface C may offset initial post-thaw losses at depth. Collapse-scar bog peat accumulation rates outpace the former-plateau peat loss in a matter of years to decades. Older landscapes (i.e., those that began accumulating peat many thousands of years ago), are subject to greater C loss following thaw than are younger landscapes(i.e., those that initiated only a couple thousand years ago), leading to a much longer period of net C loss from the ecosystem in older peatlands.",

The volcanic edifice rises 460 m from its base and comprises a central vent, dominated by lapilli-tuff and minor pillow lava and dykes; and a surrounding plateau underlain by a sequence of dipping beds of basaltic tuff-breccia and capped by a series of flat-lying, subaerial lava flows. We present a 1:10,000 geological map for Kima’Kho Mountain building on the preliminary work of Ryane et al. (2010). We use the volcanic stratigraphy to explore the implications of three unique features. (1) The central cone comprises massive to crudely-bedded lapilli tuffs containing abundant armoured lapilli - cores of highly-vesicular pyroclasts coated with blocky to cuspate vitric ash. These units suggest an explosive origin from within an ice-enclosed lake, and deposited by wet, dilute pyroclastic surge events. (2) The entire stratigraphic sequence hosts at least two \"passage zones\" (cf. Jones, 1969); the presence and geometry of these passage zones constrain ice thicknersses at the time of eruption and inform on the englacial lake dynamics. (3) Lastly, our field-based stratigraphic relationships are at odds with the classic tuya model (i.e. an effusive onset to the eruption, forming pillow basalts, followed by explosive activity).

            "abstract": "Continent–continent collisional systems represent the largest orogens on Earth and provide locations to study processes that drive the transition from contraction and crustal thickening to extension and collapse. The Greater Himalayan Zone (GHZ) exposed along strike of the Himalayan orogen contains exhumed mid-crustal metasedimentary rocks. To better understand the history of burial, crustal flow, and partial melting during the early stages of Himalayan tectonics in the Eocene to ~40 Myr into its orogenic evolution, monazite was analyzed from five migmatitic gneisses and five host gneisses exposed across two transects within central and eastern Bhutan. Monazite was analyzed in situ by the split-stream laser-ablation (LASS) ICPMS technique, which allows simultaneous collection of U-Th-Pb isotopes and trace-element abundances. The migmatites from the eastern Bhutan transect yield monazite dates that record melt crystallization as young as ca. 15–13 Ma. The host gneisses yield similar to younger (down to ca. 11 Ma) dates, documenting coeval to continued metamorphism of the GHZ. In comparison, melt crystallization in the central Bhutan rocks ended by ca. 18 Ma, and metamorphic monazite from a metapelite record metamorphism until ca. 14 Ma. In the migmatite and host-rock samples from both transects, the trace-element data show an inverse correlation between date and the HREE concentration. This trend likely documents the breakdown of garnet, which probably coincides with the first stages of GHZ exhumation. Thus, the LASS data showed that garnet breakdown and GHZ exhumation occurred from ca. 18 to 14 Ma in eastern Bhutan and ca. 20 to 17 Ma in central Bhutan. The new monazite data suggest different histories for the melt crystallization, metamorphism, and exhumation of the GHZ rocks between central and eastern Bhutan, even though the present day rocks from the two transects are only exposed ~60 km apart. Moreover, in comparison to other parts of the eastern Himalaya, the new geochronometric data correlate with the previously-described trend in which melt crystallization and metamorphism occured at progressively younger times from west (ca. 26 Ma) to east (ca. 13 Ma).",

            "abstract": "The recent discovery of cryptotephra visually and chemically matched to the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT, 75.0 ± 0.9 kyr) in Lake Malawi drill core sediments has spurred renewed interest in this period of time in East Africa. The YTT is the most recent and largest of the four Mount Toba eruptions, and is the only super-eruption to have taken place during the Quaternary. The timing of the YTT approximately coincides with a hypothesized human genetic bottleneck. Several climate models have proposed an episode of global cooling following the YTT; however, the magnitude and duration of the cooling is much debated, ranging from just a few degrees of cooling to a state of volcanic winter. Cored sediments from Lake Malawi provide an excellent record of local variability in the lake’s watershed that may be linked to specific climatic events. To investigate the possible effects of the YTT in East Africa, we continuously sampled Lake Malawi drill core 2A-10H-2 at 2-4 mm (~6 yr) intervals above and below the first occurrence of the YTT. Poaceae phytoliths were grouped into plant functional types (C3, C4, xerophytic, mesophytic, arboreal, etc.), revealing mostly subtle changes in terrestrial vegetation over the ~400 yr time period examined. Abrupt increases in concentration values for phytoliths derived from riverine Podostemaceae plants appear to signal increased discharge from rivers draining the surrounding uplands. Perhaps most significant is the increasing trend in burned phytoliths and decreasing trend in tree phytoliths post-YTT. Although there appears to be a very weak cooling signal synchronous with the YTT, the most abrupt terrestrial vegetation changes appear to be better correlated with the deposition of a slightly older cryptotephra horizon derived from the local Rungwe Volcanic Province. A potential complication with this record is the existence of a turbidite pre-YTT that encompasses the Rungwe horizon.",

            "abstract": "The origin and source rock of alkali-rich and SiO2-undersatured magmas in the Earth`s upper mantle have been under debate for a long time. The garnet signature in rare earth element patterns of such magmas suggest a garnet-bearing source rock, which could be garnet lherzolite or garnet pyroxenite.\nPartial melting experiments were performed at 3 GPa and 1345-1445 °C in a piston-cylinder apparatus using mixtures of natural lherzolite with 0.4-0.7 wt% H2O and 0.4-0.7 wt% CO2 as starting materials. Different designs of AuPd capsules were used for melt extraction. Mineral and melt phases were analysed with electron microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\nThe degree of partial melting in the experiments ranges from ~20% to ~4% and decreases with decreasing temperature and decreasing volatile content in the starting material. All samples contain olivine and orthopyroxene. Garnet is present in experiments performed below 1420 °C. The amount of clinopyroxene decreases with increasing degree of partial melting and volatile concentration in the starting material. Depending on the capsule design the melts quenched to glasses or to a mixture of quench crystals and residual glass.\nThe composition of the partial melts ranges from basalts through picrobasalts to foidites. The alkali concentration increases and the SiO2 concentration decreases with decreasing degree of partial melting and increasing volatile concentration in the starting material. The partial melts are similar in many aspects to alkali intraplate magmas (basanites to melilitites), although they are richer in MgO. Compositions closer to natural basanites could be obtained either at lower degree of melting (and lower volatile contents) or through olivine fractionation. Our results strongly suggests that.\nSiO2-undersaturated intraplate magmas can be generated by mantle melting of garnet-lherzolite in the presence of H2O and CO2 in the Earth`s upper mantle at 3 GPa (~100 km depth).",

            "abstract": "Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurs in minerals, metals, ice and impact on large scale mechanisms as seismic anisotropy, mechanical properties inside the Earth mantle, material forming and anisotropic flow in polar ice sheet, for instance. In this frame, ice can be considered as a model material due to a strong viscoplastic anisotropy and deformation heterogeneities, which are precursors of the recrystallization. During creep deformation at high temperature, DRX occurs from 1% strain and involves grain nucleation and grain boundary migration. As DRX induces an evolution of microstructure and texture, it strongly affects the mechanical behavior, and it is expected to modify the strain field at the grain and/or the sample scale. Creep test (σ=0.5-0.8 MPa) were performed at high temperature (T/Tf 0,98) on granular polycrystalline ice (grains size 1mm) and columnar polycrystalline ice (microstructure 2D 1/2 in plane grain size 10mm) up to 18 % strain. Columnar ice provides interesting feature as it contains only one grain through the thickness and the columns are parallel. Post-deformation texture analysis with an Automatic Ice Texture Analyzer (AITA) and with EBSD (Geoscience Montpellier) were used to investigate DRX impact on texture and microstructure, at different scales. With increasing strain texture evolves to a strong concentrated girdle with a preferential orientation of c-axis close to 35° from the compression axis. During the experiment, local strain field is measured on the surface of the sample by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) with a spatial resolution between 0.2 and 0.5 mm, and a strain resolution between 0.2% to 1%. Grain size being large, we obtain a relatively good intra-granular resolution of the strain field. Thanks to the 2D configuration of the columnar ice samples, we can superimpose the strain field measured by DIC. We will present an overview of the impact of DRX on the texture and microstructure, from the 3D configuration down to a close focus on a triple junction. In particular, we will provide original observations of strain-field evolution associated with the nucleation of new grains and subboundaries close to this triple junction. Associated with post-deformation analyses by AITA and EBSD, these observations enable to follow the strain redistribution due to the nucleation.",

            "abstract": "CSciBox is an integrated software system for the construction and evaluation of age models of paleo-environmetal archives, both directly dated and cross dated. The time has come to encourage cross-pollinization between earth science and computer science in dating paleorecords. This project addresses that need.\nThe CSciBox code, which is being developed by a team of computer scientists and geoscientists, is open source and freely available on github. The system employs modern database technology to store paleoclimate proxy data and analysis results in an easily accessible and searchable form. This makes it possible to do analysis on the whole core at once, in an interactive fashion, or to tailor the analysis to a subset of the core without loading the entire data file. CSciBox provides a number of 'components' that perform the common steps in age-model construction and evaluation: calibrations, reservoir-age correction, interpolations, statistics, and so on. The user employs these components via a graphical user interface (GUI) to go from raw data to finished age model in a single tool: e.g., an IntCal09 calibration of 14C data from a marine sediment core, followed by a piecewise-linear interpolation. CSciBox's GUI supports plotting of any measurement in the core against any other measurement, or against any of the variables in the calculation of the age model-with or without explicit error representations. Using the GUI, CSciBox's user can import a new calibration curve or other background data set and define a new module that employs that information. Users can also incorporate other software (e.g., Calib, BACON) as 'plug ins.' In the case of truly large data or significant computational effort, CSciBox is parallelizable across modern multicore processors, or clusters, or even the cloud.\nThe next generation of the CSciBox code, currently in the testing stages, includes an automated reasoning engine that supports a more-thorough exploration of plausible age models and cross-dating scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The recent devastating tsunamis having occurred during the last decades have highlighted the essential necessity to deploy operationnal warning systems and educate coastal populations. This could not be prepared correctly without a minimum knowledge about the tsunami history. That is the case of the Lesser Antilles islands, where a few handfuls of tsunamis have been reported over the past 5 centuries, some of them leading to notable destructions and inundations. But the lack of accurate details for most of the historical tsunamis and the limited period during which we could find written information represents an important problem for tsunami hazard assessment in this region. Thus, it is of major necessity to try to find other evidences of past tsunamis by looking for sedimentary deposits. Unfortunately, island tropical environments do not seem to be the best places to keep such deposits burried. In fact, heavy rainfalls, storms, and all other phenomena leading to coastal erosion, and associated to human activities such as intensive sugarcane cultivation in coastal flat lands, could caused the loss of potential tsunami deposits. Lots of places have been accurately investigated within the Lesser Antilles (from Sainte-Lucia to the British Virgin Islands) the last 3 years and nothing convincing has been found. That is when archeaological investigations excavated a 8-cm thick sandy and shelly layer in downtown Fort-de-France (Martinique), wedged between two well-identified layers of human origin (Fig. 1), that we found new hope: this sandy layer has been quickly attributed without any doubt to the 1755 tsunami, using on one hand the information provided by historical reports of the construction sites, and on the other hand by numerical modeling of the tsunami (wave heights, velocity fields, etc.) showing the ability of this transoceanic tsunami to wrap around the island after ~7 hours of propagation, enter Fort-de-France's Bay with enough energy to carry sediments, and inundate it. Helping with this discovery, we conclude that tsunami markers could have been simply buried and preserved by human earthmoving, leveling and other building activities. It also shows how a collaborative research involving geology and archaeology could chart a new course to greatly improve our tsunami databases.",

            "abstract": "The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) uses an airborne LiDAR system to measure basin-wide snow depth with cm-scale accuracy at ~1m spatial resolution. This is accomplished by creating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) over snow-free terrain in the summer, then repeating the flights again when the terrain is snow-covered and subtracting the elevations. Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is then calculated by incorporating modeled snow density estimates, and when combined with coincident spectrometer albedo measurements, informs distributed hydrologic modeling and runoff prediction. This method provides SWE estimates of unprecedented accuracy and extent compared to traditional snow surveys and towers, and 24hr latency data products through the ASO processing pipeline using Apache Tika and OODT software. The timely ASO outputs support operational decision making by water/dam operators for optimal water management.\nThe water-resource snowpack in the western US lies in remote mountainous terrain, spanning large areas containing steep faces at all aspects, often amongst tree canopy. This extreme terrain presents unusual challenges for LiDAR, and requires high altitude flights to achieve wide area coverage, high point density to capture small terrain features, and the ability to capture all slope aspects without shadowing. These challenges were met by the new state-of-the-art Riegl LMS-Q1560 LiDAR system, which incorporates two independent laser channels and a single rotating mirror. Both lasers and mirror are designed to provide forward, backward, and nadir look capability, which minimizes shadowing and ensures data capture even on very steep slopes. The system is capable of logging more than 10 simultaneous pulses in the air, which allows data collection at extremely high resolution while maintaining very high altitude which reduces complete region acquisition time significantly, and allows data collection over terrain with extreme elevation variation. Our experience to-date includes acquisition of data over terrain relief of more than 3500m, and ranges of up to 6000m in a single swath. We present data acquired during spring of 2013 and 2014 in western Colorado and the central Sierra Nevada, which demonstrates the capability of the new LiDAR technology and shows basin-wide measured snow depth and SWE results.",

            "abstract": "Strong variation of multiphase fluid properties and conduit geometry with depth are defining characteristics of magmatic conduits. This background stratification has important implications for the excitation and propagation of waves through conduits, and the coupling of these fluid motions to the surroundings to produce seismic and infrasonic radiation. We develop a spectral and time domain numerical method to study perturbations to a basaltic magmastatic column, including non-equilibrium degassing and conduit width changes with depth, with a free top surface to model an active lava lake. We show that resonant modes of such a conduit to first order reflect the total magma water content, which sets the depth of volatile exsolution. Above the exsolution depth, wave propagation through the multiphase fluid is strongly dispersive, due to gas exsolution effects at periods greater than the time scale for exsolution and gravitational restoring forces at wavelengths greater than the scale height. We also find a class of nonpropagating and highly attenuated modes. Due to background stratification, wave modes are localized spatially around the depth of exsolution. Below this depth, waves propagate at the pure fluid sound speed, which may be nearly two orders of magnitude faster than the multiphase sound speed.\nWe have also extended our model to couple waves in conduits to dikes and sills branching off of the conduit. This coupled model matches fluid pressure at the fracture mouth and accounts for mass exchange between the fracture and the conduit. It can be used to investigate how waves propagating down the conduit can excite resonant oscillation of dikes and sills as has been inferred in, for example, the shallow plumbing system at Kilauea, HI, where Very Long Period (VLP) seismic signals have been commonly although episodically observed since 2007. These signals commonly have source depths around 1 km depths, where source mechanisms suggest a sill intersects the conduit, but likely are triggered near the surface from some combination of degassing or rockfall that excites conduit resonant modes. We will explore the importance both of this coupled sill-conduit geometry, and of conduit modes localized at the water exsolution depth, on the seismic wave field generated by near surface fluid excitation of a magmastatic column.",

            "abstract": "Global High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) L2p products are available from many different satellite-based instruments. Assimilation and fusion of SSTs from multiple sources requires knowledge of the expected accuracy and uncertainly of a retrieval and confidence that a pixel is within the uncertainty required by the application. The GHRSST L2p files provide quality levels with labels such as “worst”, “acceptable”, or “best.” But what do these levels actually mean to a user in terms of uncertainty and bias? Does “acceptable” have the same meaning for data providers and users? Currently there is no standard or consensus for the accuracy requirement of a quality level. GHRSST providers rely on matchup databases of satellite and in situ SSTs to provide Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES). The GHRSST L2P MODIS SSES values currently are stored in a 6-dimensional Look Up Table (LUT) – often referred to as a hypercube. This LUT lists uncertainties stratified by quality level, season, latitude, viewing geometry, surface temperature, and “wet” or “dry” atmospheres. While this approach is more useful than a single aggregate SSES estimate, the coarse nature of the hypercube bins produces obvious discontinuities in uncertainty fields at some bin boundaries when geographically mapped. In reality, the SSES should vary more smoothly as a function of different combinations of factors influencing the accuracy of retrievals. We will present ongoing efforts to model the SST bias and uncertainty as a smooth function of some of the dimensions of the SSES hypercube. Additionally, we aim to classify pixels into quality categories with explicitly defined ranges of bias and uncertainty. The ultimate goal is to develop methods that could be deployed across multiple sensors to establish a standard for objective, quantitative definitions of SST retrieval quality.",

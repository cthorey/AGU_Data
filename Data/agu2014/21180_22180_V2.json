            "abstract": "Tsunamigenic deposits preserved in the offshore, shallow (<30msl) uppershelf environment has been suggested as a possible resource for improving the understanding of tsunami sedimentological dynamics and producing a more detailed paleotsunami record. On one hand, this zone is advantageous due to its relatively lower susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbance and certain types of erosion. However, the added complications of collection difficulties, marine dynamics and disturbance, and heterogeneity may prove this archive less desirable and accessible. Recent results of a multitude of offshore shallow coring efforts in the eastern Mediterranean and northern Red Sea will be presented and discussed with regard to the question of the usefulness, limitations, and advantages of these offshore records. Broadly summarized, like their terrestrial counterparts, the offshore archive requires extensive attention to the local background conditions and characteristics of the surrounding contributing sources in order to recognize, interpret, and mine the information contained within them. While some tsunami indicator criteria remain the ‘rule’, their expression and appearance inter and intrasite can vary considerably and therefore the ability to recognize them challenging. Ultimately, as more results are shared from recent modern analogues and compared with sedimentological anomalies with possible tsunamigenic characteristics within the offshore sedimentological record, the better and more precisely these deposits will be defined and interpreted.",

            "abstract": "The melting curve of Ni has been determined to 125 GPa using laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) experiments and two melting criteria: the appearance of liquid diffuse scattering (LDS) during in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and simultaneous plateaux in temperature vs. laser power functions [1]. Our melting curve (Fig. 1) is in good agreement with most theoretical studies [e.g. 2] and the available shock wave data (Fig. 2). It is, however, dramatically steeper than the previous off-line LH-DAC studies in which the determination of melting was based on the visual observation of motion aided by the laser speckle method [e.g. 3]. We estimate the melting point of Ni at the inner-core boundary (ICB; 330 GPa) to be 5800±700 K (2σ), ~2500 K higher than the estimate based on the laser speckle method [3] and within error of Fe (6230±500 K) as determined in a similar in situ LH-DAC study [4]. We find that laser speckle based melting curves coincide with the onset of rapid sub-solidus recrystallization, suggesting that visual observations of motion may have misinterpreted dynamic recrystallization as melt convection. Our new melting curve suggests that the reduction in ICB temperature due to the alloying of Ni with Fe is likely to be significantly smaller than would be expected had the earlier experimental Ni melting studies been correct.\nWe have applied our methodology to a range of other transition metals (Mo, Ti, V, Cu). In the case of Mo, Ti and V the melting curves are in good agreement with the shock compression and theoretical melting studies but hotter and steeper than those based on the laser speckle method, as with Ni. Cu is an exception in which all studies agree, including those employing the laser speckle method. These results go a long way toward resolving the the long-standing controversy over the phase diagrams of the transition metals as determined from static LH-DAC studies on the one hand, and theoretical and dynamic compression studies on the other.\n[1] Lord et al.

To this end, 42 cases equally distributed under the six most frequent upper air synoptic conditions, which are associated with convective activity in the region of interest, were utilized considering two different soil moisture scenarios. In the first scenario, the model was initialized with the surface soil moisture of the ECMWF analysis data that usually does not take into account the modification of soil moisture due to agricultural activity in the area of interest. In the second scenario, the soil moisture in the upper soil layers of the study area was modified to the field capacity for the irrigated cropland. Three model domains, covering Europe, the Mediterranean Sea and northern Africa (d01), the wider area of Greece (d02) and central Greece – Thessaly region (d03) are used at horizontal grid-spacings of 15km, 5km and 1km respectively. The model numerical results indicate a strong dependence of convective spatiotemporal characteristics from the soil moisture difference between the two scenarios.   ",

The TERN AusCover Facility comprises a national expert network that provides remote sensing data such as satellite-derive biophysical products, advanced remote sensing products and ground-validation information free and online to the research community.\nTERN and AusCover have collected in situ data for a number of 5 km x 5 km supersites from nearly every state and territory in Australia. These data include spectrophotometer data, sun photometer and ozonometer data, airborne and terrestrial LIDAR data and airborne hyperspectral data.\nAs part of the AusCover facility and in conjunction with Landgate, Western Australia, Curtin University has modified the atmospheric correction and surface reflectance processing scheme from Landgate to process 12 extra MODIS bands to surface reflectance, thus providing 19 bands. This processing scheme uses the Simple Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) to produce reflectance data.\nUntil recently, only the first 7 MODIS bands were available with the MODIS institutional algorithm for surface reflectance, MOD09, but this has altered to now also provide 9 extra bands. MOD09 is based around 6S to produce reflectance data.\nThis case study makes use of hyperspectral airborne data captured over the Credo TERN supersite to compare the surface reflectance products from MOD09 and the SMAC-based 19-band reflectance process.\nThis work required validating the airborne data against a set in situ reflectance measurements of large calibration targets. The validated airborne data were resampled spatially and spectrally to MODIS bands and both the airborne and MODIS data were mapped to the same spatial grid.\nDirect pixel comparisons have been made between the airborne data and the two algorithms, and between the algorithms themselves.\nThe algorithms show good agreement to the airborne data and to each other with RMS errors less than 0.025 and r2 values greater than 0.95. This would indicate both algorithms are viable methods to produce surface reflectance data over the Credo supersite and provides a roadmap to extend the comparison to the other AusCover sites.",

            "abstract": "The rapidly changing climate and environment in polar regions in the 20th and 21st centuries are well documented by scientists. Yet, this understanding is not well disseminated to students and the general public because the language of science is often inaccessible to these groups. To increase participation in science about the changing Polar regions, we organized a series of interdisciplinary events at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, in 2013/14 called “Polar Perspectives on Art and Science”. This series brought five artist/scholars to Rutgers and reached a broad audience of students, faculty and the general public. Accompanying this series were two high-profile events. First, the Zimmerli Art Museum’s academic-year-long exhibit, “Glacial Perspectives,” displayed paintings and photographs by Diane Burko documenting rapidly changing glacial, and polar landscapes. Second, the “Let Us Talk About Water” event included a screening of the documentary “Chasing Ice” followed by a panel discussion at the Rutgers Cinema. Financial support was provided by Zimmerli Art Museum’s Andrew W. Mellon Endowment Fund, Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences, Inc., Rutgers Centers for Global Advancement and International Affairs, GAIA, and many other Rutgers institutes and departments. Student feedback on the “Polar Perspectives on Science and Art” suggest that art was effective in enhancing engagement and understanding of contemporary polar change. Furthermore, the many events created a forum for reoccurring and stimulating discussions among people with their academic home in widely different disciplines, including humanities, and physical and social sciences.",

During Expedition 348, the drilling vessel Chikyu advanced the ultra-deep riser hole at Site C0002, located 80 km offshore of the Kii Peninsula, from a depth of 860 meters below sea floor (mbsf) to 3058.5 mbsf, the world record for the deepest scientific ocean drilling, and cased it for future deepening. The drilling operation successfully obtained data on formation physical properties from logging while drilling (LWD) tools, as well as from lithological analyses of cuttings and core from the interior of the active accretionary prism at the Nankai Trough. IODP Site C0002 is the currently only borehole to access the deep interior of an active convergent margin.\nPreliminary scientific results of Expedition 348 are as follows: (1) Fine-grained turbiditic mudstones with coarser silty and sandy interbeds, exhibiting steep dips (between ~60 and 90 degrees) are predominant in the prism down to ~3000 mbsf. The biostratigraphic age of the sediments in the lowermost part of the hole is thought to be 9–11 Ma, with an assumed age of accretion of 3–5 Ma. (2) Slickenlined surfaces, deformation bands and mineral veins are present throughout the drilled interval, while well-developed scaly clay fabrics are increasingly observed below ~2200 mbsf. A substantial fault zone with well-developed foliation was successfully cored from the deep interior of the prism at ~2205 mbsf. (3) Porosity generally decreases from ~60% to ~20% from the seafloor to 3000 mbsf. However, physical properties including grain density, electrical conductivity and P-wave velocity suggest fairly homogeneous properties in the interior of the prism between ~2000 and 3000 mbsf. (4) Mud gas analysis during the riser drilling indicates that a source of methane gas shifts from microbial origin to thermogenic at around 2325 mbsf. (5) The maximum horizontal principal stress at ~2200 mbsf is in the NE-SW direction. The inner wedge at ~ 2000 mbsf is currently in a strike-slip stress regime.",

            "abstract": "Since 1950, observations show a robust negative trend of the seasonal rainfall associated with the South Asian summer monsoon over India coinciding with a continuous decrease in surface solar radiation (“dimming”) over South Asia due to an increase of local aerosol emissions. On the intraseasonal timescale the summer monsoon fluctuates between periods of enhanced and reduced rainfall. The frequency of occurrence of these active and breaks monsoon phases affects directly the seasonal monsoon rainfall.\nThis study investigates the regional pattern and changes of the South Asian monsoon for the period 1979-2012 using the regional atmospheric model HIRHAM5 with a horizontal resolution of 0.25° forced at the lateral and lower boundaries with ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Despite the dry bias in the mean summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian landmass, the simulated temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns are in agreement with the ERA-Interim reanalysis indicating a realistic representation of important dynamical summer monsoon features. In addition, mechanisms which controls active and break phases within the summer monsoon season are analyzed using daily outgoing longwave radiation model data as an identification tool of monsoon breaks as proposed by Krishnan et al. (2000). Model results reveal an increasing trend of the cumulative monsoon break days of around 1.4 days per year during the last 30 years. The possible link between this increasing of cumulative monsoon break days and the observed decrease of seasonal South Asian monsoon rainfall will be the scope of further investigations.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity within headwater fluvial networks depends largely on subsurface patterns of moisture. Dynamic subsurface properties that control those patterns can vary widely and are poorly constrained in many systems. However, subsurface conditions change seasonally in a predictable way in catchments underlain by permafrost due to increasing thaw throughout the summer season, and those changes can be systematically measured. Zero-order linear flow features known as water tracks are found in upland permafrost hillslopes and occupy up to 35% of the landscape. Water tracks often connect to downstream fluvial systems via subsurface pathways, but those connections are poorly understood. We present data from six water tracks underlain by permafrost in northern Alaska. We improve our understanding of water tracks and their connections to downstream fluvial systems in two ways. First, we compare the fraction of snow and rain comprising flows in water tracks and the downstream systems to which they connect, and we discuss the resulting constraints on biogeochemical fluxes in these systems. Second, we examine the subsurface controls on water track connectivity patterns by characterizing the water tracks’ thermal signatures. We demonstrate that a shallow unfrozen layer permits subsurface flow to continue below a surface frozen layer for up to 6 months after air temperatures drop below freezing, enhancing fall and winter water track downstream connectivity. Because winter air temperatures are projected to increase and become more variable, we examine the role of freeze-thaw events on hydrologic connectivity: some water tracks are less responsive to rapid air temperature changes than surrounding hillslopes. At these sites, soils inside the water tracks remain frozen and impermeable for ~10 more days each year and cycle through fewer freeze-thaw cycles than the same soils outside water tracks. Some shallow soils outside some water tracks freeze and thaw up to 3-fold more times per year than water track soils. We discuss how thermal responses of water tracks influence downstream biogeochemical fluxes in the dynamic freeze-thaw periods.",

            "abstract": "The elevation history of the Andes is highly debated. Rapid, substantial pulses of diachronous surface uplift in the middle to late Miocene have been claimed in the northern and southern Bolivian Altiplano. The interpretation is based on clumped isotope (Δ47) and oxygen isotope (δ18O) data and usually either (a) disregards climate change, or (b) applies arbitrary “climate corrections” that contrasts paleoclimate observations and climate model results. Here, we present new paleoelevation estimates from previously published Δ47-temperatures and δ18O data and demonstrate how paleoclimate modeling results from GCMs can be applied to Δ47-temperature estimates and how it affects paleoelevation assessments in the Andes.\nIn the southern Bolivian Andes, we find: (1) Δ47-derived temperatures reflect peak summer air temperatures (PSAT). Modern PSAT – elevation relationships imply Andean paleoelevation estimates of <2000m at 16 Ma, ~3000m at 13 Ma, and ~4000m at 8Ma. (2) Regional GCMs indicate a non-adiabatic PSAT change of 2.1°C/1000m. Taking regional cooling into account, estimated paleoelevations reach ~2300m at 16 Ma and ~3300m at 13Ma. (3) Assuming the middle Miocene Climatic Optimum caused a global mean temperature increase of 3°C, the newly estimated maximum paleoelevation for 16Ma would be ~2850m. In the northern Bolivian Andes, no modern Δ47-temperature estimates exist to ensure a correct correlation between modern elevation and clumped isotope temperatures. In addition, δ18O data exist only for elevations <1700m and >4000m. To establish the relationship between δ18O and elevation we use observations together with simulated δ18O at 4000m, 3000m, and 2000m from our GCM. Based on mean carbonate δ18O compositions, late Miocene paleoelevations are estimated to be ~3100m at 11Ma and ~4100m at 7Ma.\nWe anticipate to highlight the importance of a thoughtful interpretation of climate and climate change when inferring paleoelevations from isotopes. Our results demonstrate that middle to late Miocene carbonate clumped isotopes and δ18O data from the northern and southern Bolivian Altiplano may be interpreted to show synchronous uniform surface uplift.",

We conducted NUI’s first under-ice deployments during the July 2014 F/V Polarstern PS86 expedition at 86° N 6 W° in the Arctic Ocean - near the Aurora hydrothermal vent site on the Gakkel Ridge approximately 200 km NE of Greenland. We conducted 4 dives to evaluate and develop NUI’s overall functioning and its individual engineered subsystems. On each dive, dead-reckoning (Ice-locked Doppler sonar and north-seeking gyrocompass) complemented by acoustic ranging provided navigation, supporting closed-loop control of heading, depth, and XY position relative to the ice. Science operations included multibeam transects of under-ice topography, precision vertical profiles for the bio-sensor suite and IR/radiance sensor suite, IR/radiance/multibeam transects at constant depth interlaced with vertical profiles and upward-looking digital still-camera surveys of the ice, including areas rich with algal material. The fiber-optic tether remained intact throughout most of all 4 dives. Consistent with the NUI concept of operations, in 3 of 4 dives the fiber-optic tether eventually failed, and the vehicle was then commanded acoustically in a series of short-duration maneuvers to return to Polarstern for recovery. These preliminary dives ranging up to 800 m from Polarstern at a max. depth of 45 m, and traveling up to 3.7 km under moving sea ice.

            "abstract": "The increased number of stations with high quality sensors and the international exchange of waveform improve the location and magnitude for recent events. Various international organizations (ISC, EMSC, etc.) have produced “standard” exchange procedures to merge parametric data from different observatories. Nevertheless, this does not exist for events back to the year 60th despite they are of first importance for seismic hazard assessment.\nSeveral initiatives are regularly done to produce upgraded catalogs covering such period but they are most of the time “only merging” available parametric data and using, for magnitude homogenization, regressions between various datasets.\nThe SI-Hex project provides a catalogue of seismicity for metropolitan France related to the years 1962-2009 by taking into account the contributions of the various seismological networks. In contrast with all the previous French catalogs of seismicity, this collaborative project makes use of the original data coming from all regional and national seismic networks operating in metropolitan France, together with parametric data coming from the surrounding European networks.\nHypocenter locations are based on preferential solutions extracted from a multi-origin database. For each event from 1962 to 2009, one origin is computed using a single 1D velocity model covering metropolitan France and by merging arrival times coming from French and European stations. In order to improve the accuracy in hypocenter location, solutions calculated by regional observatory with regional velocity models, are taken as preferential solution when available.\nWe provide for the first time a Moment magnitude Mw. It was computed from coda-wave for most of the Mw>3.4 events, and from converted local magnitudes ML for the smaller events.\nSpecial attention was paid to the discrimination between natural and artificial seismic events. Results are available at www.franceseisme.fr/sismicite.html.",

            "abstract": "The eWaterCycle project works towards running an operational hyper-resolution hydrological global model, assimilating incoming satellite data in real time, and making 14 day predictions of floods and droughts.\nA problem encountered in the eWatercycle project is that the computer memory needed to store a single ensemble member becomes so large that storing enough ensembles to run the EnKF is impossible, even when using mitigating strategies such as covariance inflation or localization.\nReduction of Used Memory Ensemble Kalman Filtering (RumEnKF) is introduced as a variant on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). RumEnKF differs from EnKF in that it does not store the entire ensemble, but rather only saves the first two moments of the ensemble distribution. In this way, the number of ensemble members that can be calculated is less dependent on available memory, and mainly on available computing power (CPU). RumEnKF is developed to make optimal use of current generation super computer architecture, where the number of available floating point operations (flops) increases more rapidly than the available memory and where inter-node communication can quickly become a bottleneck. In this presentation, two simple models are used (auto-regressive and Lorenz) to show that RumEnKF performs similar to the EnKF. Furthermore, it is also shown that increasing the ensemble size has a similar impact on the estimation error from the two algorithms\nIn this preliminary results, RumEnKF reduces the used memory compared to the EnKF when the number of ensemble members is greater than half the number of state variables. Future research will focus on strategies to further reduce the memory burden of running non-linear data assimilation on very large models.",

The adsorption of As(III) was inhibited by the presence of As(V) over the whole pH range when compared to As(III) only conditions. As(V) was adsorbed to a similar extent with As(III) at low pH under competitive conditions. Isotherm studies also showed that As(V) significantly decreased the adsorption of As(III) at pH 5, while the presence of As(III) had a small effect on As(V) adsorption. The Freundlich isotherm equation was successfully fitted to both single and bi-component adsorption scenarios of As(III) and As(V). At the same time intervals in the first 2 h under competitive conditions, kinetics studies suggested that the amount of As(III) adsorbed in the presence of As(V) was reduced compared to the single component system at low pH. The effect of As(III) on the adsorption rate of As(V) was negligible. A pseudo-second-order model could be fitted perfectly to each species under both single and competitive conditions. The spectra of ferrihydrite with adsorbed As(III), As(V) or both As species have a similar shape by ATR-FTIR, indicating that competition may be at play.",

            "abstract": "We update our models of Love and Rayleigh wave phase-velocity structure using USArray data through mid 2014. We make measurements of the phase at periods from 25 to 100 s using a two-station method that assumes a great-circle arrival path for Love waves, and uses the estimated arrival angle for Rayleigh waves to correct the two-station calculation. Arrival-angle estimates are made with a mini-array method that employs a grid search to select the back-azimuth to the source that best predicts the phase observed on a local subset of stations. The two-station phase data with inter-station path lengths between 350 and 750 km are inverted to produce phase-velocity models at discrete periods. The new data set expands the modeled area, covering the entire contiguous United States.\nThe mini-array method also produces an estimate of the local phase-velocity. We calculate this local phase-velocity for both Love and Rayleigh waves, and compare the measurements with the maps resulting from the inversion of the two-station measurements. The local phase velocities, two-station phase velocities, and two-station phase-velocity models are all examined for bias resulting from overtone interference. Based on previous work, we expect overtone interference to affect Love wave measurements but not Rayleigh wave measurements, and to affect the local measurements more than the two-station models.",

The seasonal forecast supplied by the APEC Climate Center (APCC) is one of available information can be used to predict drought conditions triggering forest fires in the region. The objective of this study is to assess the skill of the current and downscaled products of APCC’s seasonal forecast of 6-month lead-time for predicting ASO precipitation over the fire-prone regions. First, seasonal forecast skill by six individual models (MSC_CANCM3, MSC_CANCM4, NASA, NCEP, PNU, POAMA) and simple composite model (SCM) ensemble was assessed by considering available each ensemble members. Second, three different statistical downscaling methods including simple bias-correction (SBC), moving window regression (MWReg), and climate index regression (CIReg) were applied and the forecast sill were compared. Both current and downscaled seasonal forecast showed higher predictability over Sumatra regions compared to the Kalimantan regions. Statistical downscaling of forecasts showed the skill improvement over the Kalimantan region where current APCC’s forecast shows low predictability. Study also shows that temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) between observed and forecasted ASO precipitation increases as lead-time decrease.",

            "abstract": "Increases in the amounts of available data as well as computational power opens the possibility to tackle ever larger and more complex problems. This comes with a slew of new problems, two of which are the need for a more efficient use of available resources and a sensible organization and storage of the data. Both need to be satisfied in order to properly scale a problem and both are frequent bottlenecks in large seismic inversions using ambient noise or more traditional techniques.\n\nWe present recent developments and ideas regarding a new data format, named ASDF (Adaptable Seismic Data Format), for all branches of seismology aiding with the aforementioned problems. The key idea is to store all information necessary to fully understand a set of data in a single file. This enables the construction of self-explaining and exchangeable data sets facilitating collaboration on large-scale problems. We incorporate the existing metadata standards FDSN StationXML and QuakeML together with waveform and auxiliary data into a common container based on the HDF5 standard. A further critical component of the format is the storage of provenance information as an extension of W3C PROV, meaning information about the history of the data, assisting with the general problem of reproducibility.\n\nApplications of the proposed new format are numerous. In the context of seismic tomography it enables the full description and storage of synthetic waveforms including information about the used model, the solver, the parameters, and other variables that influenced the final waveforms. Furthermore, intermediate products like adjoint sources, cross correlations, and receiver functions can be described and most importantly exchanged with others.\n\nUsability and tool support is crucial for any new format to gain acceptance and we additionally present a fully functional implementation of this format based on Python and ObsPy. It offers a convenient way to discover and analyze data sets as well as making it trivial to execute processing functionality on modern high performance machines utilizing parallel I/O even for users not familiar with the details. An open-source development and design model as well as a wiki aim to involve the community.",

Our records reveal that episodes of ice rafting typically occurred after abrupt cooling at the site. Because the site is sensitive to the earliest phases of ice rafting as recorded by other sites across the wider Atlantic, this suggests that icebergs were not the trigger for North Atlantic cold events. Moreover we find a different relationship between cooling and the arrival of rafted ice at a site ~750km to the SE of ours. We suggest that asynchronous cooling between these locations can be explained by the more gradual southward migration of the North Atlantic polar front. We describe a mechanism that can explain the occurrence of abrupt stadial events over Greenland as a non-linear response as regional cooling continues beyond the threshold necessary for sustaining ocean circulation in its ‘warm’ mode with active convection north of Iceland. Thus while the freshwater derived from melting icebergs may provide a positive feedback for enhancing and prolonging stadial conditions, it is probably not the trigger for northern stadial events.",

            "abstract": "An extensive set of in situ water vapor (H2O) measurements obtained by the CARIBIC passenger aircraft at cruise altitude from 2005 to 2013 is presented. A description of the vertical distribution of H2O from the upper troposphere (UT) via the extra-tropical tropopause mixing layer (exTL) into the lowermost stratosphere (LMS) is given. H2O was found to undergo considerable seasonal variation, with maxima in summer and remaining in phase from the UT up to about 4 km above the tropopause. The transport and dehydration pathway of air starting at the Earth’s surface and ending at 10-12 km altitude is reconstructed based upon (i) potential temperature, (ii) relative humidity w.r.t. ice (RHi), and (iii) back trajectories as a function of altitude relative to the tropopause. RHi of an air mass is found to be primarily determined by its temperature change during recent vertical movement, i.e. cooling during ascent/expansion and warming during descent/compression. The data show with great clarity that H2O and RHi at 10-12 km altitude are controlled by three dominant transport/dehydration pathways: (i) the Hadley circulation, i.e. convective uplift in the tropics and pole-ward directed subsidence drying from the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) with observed RHi down to 2%, (ii) warm conveyor belts and mid-latitude convection transporting moist air into the UT with observed RHi usually above 60%, and (iii) the Brewer-Dobson shallow and deep branches with observed RHi down to 1%.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of helium is often considered to be one of the key elements in resolving deep mantle plume vs. upper mantle origin of hotspot-related volcanic rocks. High 3He/4He values, greater than 10 times atmospheric (Ra), are generally thought to indicate plume-related sources in the lower mantle. The use of helium isotopes in continental flood basalt (CFB) provinces has been limited by the lack of fresh rock material, poor exposures, time-integrated ingrowth of radiogenic 4He, and strong lithospheric overprinting.\nVestfjella mountain range at western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, is comprised of lava flows and intrusive rocks that belong to the Jurassic (~180 Ma) Karoo continental flood basalt province, the bulk of which is exposed in southern Africa. The Karoo CFBs and related rocks show strong lithospheric influence in their geochemistry in general, but some high-Mg dikes from Vestfjella show geochemical evidence of derivation from sublithospheric sources.\nIn an attempt to determine the first estimate for the helium isotopic composition of the Karoo mantle sources, we performed He isotopic measurements on six primitive Vestfjella dike samples collected from variably exposed nunataks. Helium was extracted by in-vacuo stepwise crushing and melting of separated and carefully hand-picked olivine phenocrysts (Ø = 0.25–1 mm; ~10 000 grains in total; abraded and unabraded fractions).\nThe results of coupled crushing and melting measurements show evidence of both cosmogenic and radiogenic helium contributions within the olivines (i.e. by having high He contents and anomalously low or high 3He/4He released by melting), which complicates interpretation of the data. As a best estimate for the mantle isotopic composition, we use the sample with the highest amount of He released (> 50%) during the first crushing step of an abraded coarse fraction, which gave 3He/4He of 7.03 ± 0.23 (2σ) Ra. This value is indistinguishable from those measured from Southwest Indian Ridge MORBs (Ra = 6.3‒7.3), the modern successor of the Africa-Antarctica rift zone. These new helium data are compatible with previous trace element and Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopic analyses that indicate the involvement of a depleted upper mantle source in Karoo CFB petrogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Analogue models predict that multiphase rifts which have experienced a change in extension direction between stretching phases will typically develop non-colinear normal fault sets and hence will display a greater frequency and range of styles of fault interactions than single-phase rifts. We test these model-based predictions by studying a natural fault network in the northern Horda Platform, northern North Sea using an integrated 3D seismic reflection and borehole dataset. We focus on the >60 km long, N-S-striking Tusse fault that has over 500 m of throw and was active in the Permian-Triassic and again in the Late Jurassic-to-Early Cretaceous. The Tusse Fault forms part of a non-colinear fault network that also comprises numerous smaller (2-10 km long), lower throw (<100 m) and predominantly NW-SE-striking faults that were only active during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. We examine how the second-stage NW-SE-striking faults have grown and interacted with the N-S-striking Tusse Fault, noting a range of end-member styles of interaction including: i) no interaction; ii) hanging-wall abutting; iii) footwall abutting; iv) cross-cutting; and v) hybrid. To constrain the nucleation and growth history of each of these interaction styles, we systematically apply throw-versus-length (T-x) plots, throw-versus-depth plots (T-z) and 3D throw contouring. This quantitative 3D analysis of the fault network demonstrates: i) pre-existing (first-stage) faults can act as sites of nucleation for second-stage faults; ii) abutting relationships are common and can develop by second-stage faults nucleating either at, or away from pre-existing faults; iii) the throw distribution on reactivated first-stage faults will be modified in a predictable manner if they are intersected or influenced by second-stage faults; and iv) fault segment boundaries, and fault kinks or corrugations along first-stage faults, can act as preferential nucleation sites for second-stage faults, and facilitate the development of complex cross-cutting relationships. In addition to furthering our fundamental understanding of the geometric and kinematic evolution of rift-related normal faults, our results also have broader implications for understanding the physiographic and tectono-stratigraphic evolution of multiphase rift basins.",

            "abstract": "The relative movement between two divergent rigid plates on a sphere can be described using a Euler pole and an angular velocity. On Earth, this typically results in extensional velocities increasing linearly as a function of the distance from the pole (for example in the South Atlantic, North Atlantic, Woodlark Basin, Red Sea Basin, etc.).\nThis property has strong implications for continental rifting and the formation of passive margins, given the role that extensional velocity plays on both rift style (wide or narrow), fault pattern, subsidence histories, and magmatism.\nUntil now, this scissor-style opening has been approached via suites of 2D numerical models of contrasting extensional velocities, complimenting field geology and geophysics. New advances in numerical modelling tools and computational hardware have enabled us to investigate the geodynamics of this problem in a 3D self-consistent high-resolution context. Using Underworld at a grid resolution of 2 km over a domain of 500 km x 500 km x 180 km, we have explored the role of the velocity gradient on the strain pattern, style of rifting, and decompression melting, along the margin.\nWe find that the three dimensionality of this problem is important. The rise of the asthenosphere is enhanced in 2D models compared to 3D numerical solutions, due to the limited volume of material available in 2D. This leads to oceanisation occurring significantly sooner in 2D models. The 3D model shows that there is a significant time and space dependent flows parallel to the rift-axis. A similar picture emerges from the stress field, showing time and space partitioning, including regions of compression separating areas dominated by extension. The strain pattern shows strong zonation along the rift axis, with increasingly localised deformation with extension velocity and though time.",

            "abstract": "Land subsidence in Shanghai caused by overly exploitation of ground water has been 93 years since 1921, with the largest cumulative land subsidence of 2.6m. Studies on controlling and alleviating land subsidence have been 53 years since 1961. Control on ground water exploitation, change in pumping aquifers, increase in artificial recharge have been used as the three measures to mitigate land subsidence. The amount of ground water exploitation decreased from 0.2 billion m3 in 1963 to 13 million m3, which meant the amount decreased by 93.5%. The amount of artificial recharge increased from 1.9 million m3 in 1963 to 18 million m3 in 2011, which meant it increased by 9.5 times. The amount of recharge was even 6 million m3 larger than the discharge. The main pumping aquifers were shift from the second and third confined aquifers to the fourth and fifth confined aquifers. With the application of the three measures, ground water levels in second and third confined aquifers increased from -20m in 1965 to -1m in 2011 and that in the fourth confined aquifer increased from -36m in 1998 to -9m in 2011. Some regional ground water drawdown cones disappeared. Land subsidence rate reduces from 38mm/year before 1965 to 7mm/year by now and some areas even rebound. The details of measures taken to control land subsidence between 1961 and 2011, and the responses in ground water flows and land subsidence characteristics are introduced. It concludes that decrease in ground water pumping is the most effective way to control land subsidence, increase in artificial recharge is a good assistant measure, and changing in pumping aquifers is not always show good results. Shanghai got increased land subsidence rate from 1990 to 2000 when changing pumping aquifers from the second and third to the fourth and fifth ones without properly evaluating the amount of exploitation in advance. It must be very careful when take the measure of changing pumping aquifers, and the proper amount of pumpage in the new aquifers should be evaluated by land subsidence models. Analysis of measures taken to control land subsidence in Shanghai and the final results could be valuable experience to refer for other areas with land subsidence problems.\nAcknowledgement: Funding supported by NSF of China No. 41272259 and NSF of Jiangsu Province No. BK2012730 is appreciated.",

            "abstract": "The response of benthic foraminifera to the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) impact event is key to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes and the specific mechanisms triggering faunal turnover in the marine realm, especially because this group did not suffer significant extinction (thus shows a continuous record across the boundary), and because its faunal turnover shows paleobiogeographic differences that remain to be explained.\nThe K/Pg transition was cored along a depth transect on ODP Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, eastern South Atlantic Ocean), where the K/Pg boundary is marked by a sharp transition from Maastrichtian clay-bearing nannofossil ooze to Danian dark reddish to brown, clay-rich nannofossil-ooze and clay. We analysed the benthic foraminiferal turnover at Sites 1262 (upper abyssal paleodepth; present depth 4755 m) and 1267 (lower bathyal; present depth 4355 m). The record at 1267 appears to be more complete than at 1262, especially the interval just at the K/Pg boundary (Westerhold et al. 2008).\nThe percentage of infaunal taxa (living buried within the sediment) was slightly lower at Site 1262 than at Site 1267, as expected for a deeper, more oligotrophic setting where the scarce food available is preferentially taken up by epifaunal morphogroups. The dominance of calcareous taxa suggests that both sites were located above the CCD throughout the K/Pg transition. Benthic assemblages from both sites are similar, but the species Tappanina eouvigeriniformis is common at Site 1267, as at lower bathyal Southern Ocean Site 690, but is absent at Site 1262.\nExtinction rates across the K/Pg boundary were very low at both sites. Morphogroup composition did not significantly change across the boundary at Site 1262, but the increase in % infaunal morphogroups and benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates at Site 1267 point to an enhanced food supply immediately after the impact. These results suggest that a short interval is missing from the lowermost Danian at Site 1262.",

            "abstract": "PM2.5 has become one of the most important aspects in recent air pollution issues. In Japan, the achievement rate of the environmental quality standard for PM2.5 is in a worse situation so far (43.3% for ambient air monitoring station, 33.3% for roadside air pollution monitoring station in FY2012). Therefore, source apportionment will be essential to policy and decision making for improving the PM2.5 pollution.\nSince 2011, we started the field monitoring study called “Current Status Elucidation and Source Contribution Assessment of PM2.5 Pollution in Collaboration with Environmental Research Institutes across Japan” which was granted by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (5B-1101) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan. PM2.5 samples were collected at 14 sites during four campaigns. Chemical analyses of carbonaceous compounds, ionic species, and elements were conducted.\nSource apportionment was performed by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF, EPA PMF 3.0) and Chemical Mass Balance (CMB, EPA CMB 8.1) models. PMF model resolved a six-factor solution. Each of these factors has a distinctive grouping of species that can be associated with a specific source sector (F1: Biomass burning, F2: Sulfate + Oil combustion, F3: Industry, F4: Nitrate, F5: Sulfate + Coal combustion, and F6: Chloride). In the winter campaign (Jan. 24 to Feb. 7) in 2013, F5 accounted for 50% of total PM2.5 mass at Tsushima (34.2°N 129.3°E, the westernmost remote site). The contribution of F5 tended to decrease toward the eastern sites (27% at Fukuoka (33.5°N 130.5°E, urban site), 22% at Higashi-Osaka (34.7°N 135.6°E, urban site)). CMB model showed similar results in the same campaign. Coal combustion accounted for 49%, 30%, and 22% of total PM2.5 mass at Tsushima, Fukuoka, and Higashi-Osaka, respectively (Fig.1). On the other hand, at urban sites, higher contributions from local sources such as secondary nitrate (16% at Fukuoka, 21% at Higashi-Osaka), diesel fuel automobile (11% at Fukuoka, 12% at Higashi-Osaka), and waste incineration (7% at Fukuoka, 14% at Higashi-Osaka) were observed. This study clearly shows that the effects from the local sources are also important at the urban sites in Japan, while the impact of transboundary pollution from the Asian Continent has attracted a lot of attention in recent years.",

From there the two methods use different approaches: IHM fits a curve to the obtained ratio (as a complex number including both the amplitude ratio and the cross phase) on the complex plane to separate out the non-FLR signal in the data, while APGM assumes that the obtained amplitude ratio and cross phase include the FLR signal only and obtains the FLR frequency and the resonance width in an algebraic manner.\nIn this paper we apply the two methods to simultaneously observed data from ground station pairs of WAD (CGM latitude and longitude: 61.3 and 318.3) - WEYB (58.6, 320.9), LGRR (61.8, 332.4) - PINA (60.0, 331.8), and PINA - THRF (57.8, 331.5), where WAD belongs to MAGDAS/CPMN while the other four belong to CARISMA. We show that IHM can properly estimate the latitudinal profile of the resonance width (which is the improved point of IHM over the original Hodograph Method) by comparing the results of applying IHM to the LGRR-PINA and PINA-THRF pairs, located along the same meridian. We also compare the IHM and APGM results to support the above-stated advantage of IHM over APGM. In addition, comparing the results of applying IHM and APGM to WAD-WEYB and LGRR-PINA-THRF, having similar latitudes but different longitudes, we discuss the longitude dependence of the FLR frequency (from which we can estimate the magnetospheric plasma density on the meridional plane including the ground station pair) and the resonance width.",

            "abstract": "To quantify impact of the climate change on a specific pest (or any weather-dependent process) in a specific site, we may use a site-calibrated pest (or other) model and compare its outputs obtained with site‑specific weather data representing present vs. perturbed climates. The input weather data may be produced by the stochastic weather generator. Apart from the quality of the pest model, the reliability of the results obtained in such experiment depend on an ability of the generator to represent the statistical structure of the real world weather series, and on the sensitivity of the pest model to possible imperfections of the generator.\nThis contribution deals with the multivariate HOWGH weather generator, which is based on a combination of parametric and non‑parametric statistical methods. Here, HOWGH is used to generate synthetic hourly series of three weather variables (solar radiation, temperature and precipitation) required by a dynamic pest model SOPRA to simulate the development of codling moth.\nThe contribution presents results of the direct and indirect validation of HOWGH. In the direct validation, the synthetic series generated by HOWGH (various settings of its underlying model are assumed) are validated in terms of multiple climatic characteristics, focusing on the subdaily wet/dry and hot/cold spells. In the indirect validation, we assess the generator in terms of characteristics derived from the outputs of SOPRA model fed by the observed vs. synthetic series.\nThe weather generator may be used to produce weather series representing present and future climates. In the latter case, the parameters of the generator may be modified by the climate change scenarios based on Global or Regional Climate Models. To demonstrate this feature, the results of codling moth simulations for future climate will be shown.\nAcknowledgements: The weather generator is developed and validated within the frame of projects WG4VALUE (project LD12029 sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR), and VALUE (COST ES 1102 action).",

            "abstract": "Chemical Abrasion Isotope-Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) is known as a high precision technique for resolving lead loss and improving the interpretation of U–Pb zircon age data. We argue that combining CA with the widely applied Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) improves the precision and accuracy of zircon dates, while removing the substantial parts with lead loss, reducing data scatter, and providing meaningful geological interpretations. The samples are magmatic rocks chosen from diﬀerent geological time periods (Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic time). All zircon separates are analysed by LA-ICP-MS before and after CA, and all age data are compared with CA-ID-TIMS 206Pb/238U dates that are considered as the most accurately age. All CA-treated zircon crystals show up to 50% less data scatter compared to the non-CA treated zircon grains and thus a reduction of the calculated uncertainties is apparent. The obtained wt average LA-ICP-MS 206Pb/238U ages of the CA-treated zircon grains are up to 4–6% higher than those of the non-CA treated crystals, exceeding the analytical uncertainties of the LA-ICP-MS dating technique of 1–2%. The damaged crystal parts, caused by U-decay, with lead loss are removed, so that we can exclude younging from the possible geological scenarios. CA-LA-ICP-MS age data are in good agreement with the CA-ID-TIMS dates and suggest advantages of using CA-LA-ICP-MS in order to deﬁne accurate ages. The use of the CA technique for very young zircons (~0.2 Ma, Kos rhyolitic tuﬀ, Greece) seems optional; as the obtained mean 206Pb/238U ages of non-CA and CA treated zircons coincide within the uncertainty. The negligible time to produce the lattice damage (based on alpha decay or spontaneous ﬁssion) makes lead loss less important for age dating and data interpretation of very young zircons (<1 Ma).\nVon Quadt, A. et al., 2014, JAAS, doi: 10.1039/c4ja00102h.",

            "abstract": "There is a requirement for low cost in-situ measurements of environmental parameters such as air quality, meteorological data, and water quality in remote areas. Currently available solutions for such measurements include remote sensing from satellite and aircraft platforms, and in-situ measurements from mobile and aircraft platforms. Fixed systems such as eddy covariance networks, tall towers, and the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are providing precision greenhouse gas measurements.\nWithin this context, the HUMSAT system designed by the University of Vigo (Spain) will complement existing high-precision measurement systems with low cost in-situ ground based sensors in remote locations using a constellation of CubeSats as a communications relay. The HUMSAT system standardizes radio communications in between deployed sensors and the CubeSats of the constellation, which act as store and forward satellites to ground stations for uploading to the internet. Current ground stations have been established at the University of Vigo (Spain) and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).\nUsers of the system may deploy their own environmental sensors to meet local requirements. The sensors will be linked to a low-cost satellite data transceiver using a standard HUMSAT protocol. The transceiver is capable of receiving data from the HUMSAT constellation to remotely reconfigure sensors without the need of physically going to the sensor location.\nThis transceiver uses a UHF channel around 437 MHz to exchange short data messages with the sensors. These data messages can contain up to 32 bytes of useful information and are transmitted at a speed around 300 bps. The protocol designed for this system handles the access to the channel by all these elements and guarantees a correct transmission of the information in such an scenario.\nThe University of Vigo has launched the first satellite of the constellation, the HUMSAT-D CubeSat in November 2013 and has deployed sensors in Spain and Brazil. Sensors will be also deployed by Cal Poly in the near future. In the following months, the SERPENS CubeSAT Mission, a joint project of the University of Brasilia and the University of Vigo will launch the second CubeSat of the constellation.",

            "abstract": "It has become widely acknowledged that the Cretaceous – Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary mass extinction (~66Ma) is related to the environmental consequences of an impact of a large extraterrestrial body. This impact likely invoked exceptionally rapid and profound global climate change, which occurred superimposed on ongoing, long-term environmental changes. The interplay between impact-related and long-term environmental changes is still poorly documented. In a recent study, we showed that a TEX86 based Sea Surface Temperature (SST) K-Pg record from Brazos River (USA) indeed shows evidence for rapid short-term cooling following the K-Pg impact. This confirmed for the first time the hypothesis of a so-called ‘impact winter’ invoked by dust and aerosols produced by the impact, blocking incoming solar radiation.\nThis short-lived cold phase has so far not been confirmed by other studies. To verify the record from Brazos River and to reveal ongoing, long-term climate change, we performed a high resolution marine palynological and organic geochemical study on four stratigraphically expanded cores from the New Jersey Shelf, eastern USA, spanning the K-Pg boundary, using the TEX86 sea surface temperature (SST) proxy. Indeed, our new composite record confirms the brief cooler episode immediately following the K-Pg impact. Here we present these impact-related sea surface temperature changes in the context of the long term climate changes across the K-Pg boundary interval.",

            "abstract": "Cloud droplet effective radius (re) and optical thickness (τc) of liquid water cloud retrieved from multi-spectral measurement of satellite-borne sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are important parameters for understanding of cloud microphysics and droplet growth process. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is scheduling to launch a new earth observation satellite, the Global Change Observation Mission - Climate (GCOM-C), in Japan fiscal year 2016. The GCOC-C consists the Second Generation Global Imager (SGLI) instrument, which is a radiometer providing near-ultraviolet-to-thermal-infrared multi-spectral measurements at 250m-1km resolution with 1150-1400km swath. Motivated by the importance of re and τc retrievals, the GCOM-C/SGLI cloud product also provides them. However, it is pointed out by previous studies that multi-spectral-retrieved re and τc are impacted by cloud vertical and horizontal inhomogeneity. This study investigates the impacts by using A-Train and Landsat-8 data. First, we interpret three re retrievals from 1.6, 2.1, and 3.7µm-band measurements (re,1.6, re,2.1, and re,3.7) in terms of cloud vertical inhomogeneity by using synergistic measurements from the CloudSat/CPR and Aqua/MODIS. For this interpretation, we use an approach called Contoured Frequency by Optical Depth Diagram (CFODD), which is a joint frequency diagram of CloudSat/CPR radar reflectivity profile as a function of in-cloud optical depth profile as classified according to retrieved re (Nakajima et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2010). The CFODD approach visualizes the linkage of re,1.6, re,2.1, and re,3.7 to cloud droplet vertical profile. Second, we simulate the biases in re and τc retrievals at 1km resolution from the MODIS and SGLI induced by cloud horizontal inhomogeneity by using high-spatial resolution measurements of Landsat-8. And then we suggest two inversion models which estimate the biases in re and τc retrievals by using co-variance matrices of multi-spectral radiances: one model explains the bias due to clear-region-contamination based on a classical mixed pixel model which is parameterized by cloud fraction. The other explains the bias due to horizontal inhomogeneity of re and τc at subpixel scale in no clear-region-contamination case.",

            "abstract": "Typical studies on natural resources from a social science perspective tend to choose one type of resource—water, for example— and ask what factors contribute to the sustainable use or wasteful exploitation of that resource. However, climate change and economic development, which are causing increased pressure on local resources and presenting communities with increased levels of tradeoffs and potential conflicts, force us to consider the trade-offs between options for using a particular resource. Therefore, the transdisciplinary approach that accurately captures the advantages and disadvantages of various possible resource uses is particularly important in the complex social-ecological systems, where concerns about inequality with respect to resource use and access have become unavoidable. Needless to say, resource management and policy require sound scientific understanding of the complex interconnections between nature and society, however, in contrast to typical international discussions, I discuss Japan not as an “advanced” case where various dilemmas have been successfully addressed by the government through the optimal use of technology, but rather as a nation seeing an emerging trend that is based on a awareness of the connections between local resources and the environment. Furthermore, from a historical viewpoint, the nexus of local resources is not a brand-new idea in the experience of environmental governance in Japan. There exist the local environment movements, which emphasized the interconnection of local resources and succeeded in urging the governmental action and policymaking. For this reason, local movements and local knowledge for the resource governance warrant attention. This study focuses on the historical cases relevant to water resource management including groundwater, and considers the contexts and conditions to holistically address local resource problems, paying particular attention to interactions between science and society. I will argue the research design to enhance the holistic view of local stakeholders on local resources as the key to effective transdisciplinary approach through the on-going research project focusing on the water-energy-food nexus.",

            "abstract": "The long, high-resolution and largely undisturbed depositional record of polar ice sheets is one of the greatest resources in paleoclimate research. The vertical profile of isotopic and other geochemical tracers provides a full history of depositional and dynamical variations. Numerical simulations of this archive could afford great advances both in the interpretation of these tracers as well as to help improve ice sheet models themselves, as show successful implementations in oceanography and atmospheric dynamics. However, due to the slow advection velocities, tracer modeling in ice sheets is particularly prone to numerical diffusion, thwarting efforts that employ straightforward solutions. Previous attemps to circumvent this issue follow conceptually and computationally extensive approaches that augment traditional Eulerian models of ice flow with a semi-Lagrangian tracer scheme (e.g. Clarke et al., QSR, 2005).\nHere, we propose a new vertical discretization for ice sheet models that eliminates numerical diffusion entirely. Vertical motion through the model mesh is avoided by mimicking the real-world ice flow as a thinning of underlying layers (see figure). A new layer is added to the surface at equidistant time intervals (isochronally). Therefore, each layer is uniquely identified with an age. Horizontal motion follows the shallow ice approximation using an implicit numerical scheme. Vertical diffusion of heat which is physically desirable is also solved implicitly. A simulation of a two-dimensional section through the Greenland ice sheet will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Tropical savanna covers a large fraction of the global land area and thus may have a substantial effect on the global soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrogen. The pronounced seasonality of hygric conditions in this ecosystem affects strongly microbial process rates in the soil. As these microbial processes control the uptake, production, and release of nitrogen compounds, it is thought that this seasonality finally leads to strong temporal dynamics and varying magnitudes of gaseous losses to the atmosphere. However, given their areal extent and in contrast to other ecosystems, still few in-situ or laboratory studies exist that assess the soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrogen. We present laboratory incubation results from intact soil cores obtained from a natural savanna site in Northern Australia, where N2O, NO, and N2 emissions under controlled environmental conditions were investigated. Furthermore, in-situ measurements of high temporal resolution at this site recorded with automated static and dynamic chamber systems are discussed (N2O, NO). This data is then used to assess the performance of a process-based biogeochemical model (LandscapeDNDC), and the potential magnitude and dynamics of components of the site-scale nitrogen cycle where no measurements exist (biological nitrogen fixation and nitrate leaching). Our incubation results show that severe nutrient limitation of the soil only allows for very low N2O emissions (0.12 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and even a periodic N2O uptake. Annual NO emissions were estimated at 0.68 kg N ha-1 yr-1, while the release of inert nitrogen (N2) was estimated at 6.75 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (data excl. contribution by pulse emissions). We observed only minor N2O pulse emissions after watering the soil cores and initial rain events of the dry to wet season transition in-situ, but short-lived NO pulse emissions were substantial. Interestingly, some cores exhibited a very different N2O emission potential, indicating a substantial spatial variability of potential N release. For most soil moisture and temperature settings, N2 emissions dominated the release of gaseous nitrogen loss (82-99% of total gaseous N loss).",

There are 5 large eartquakes (M>7.0) , generalized foreshocks, occurred in the source region of M9.0 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake from 2003 to 2011, and they formed a very narrow belt, which is nearly perpendicular to the strike of the Japan Trench. We performed temporal and spatial analysis to the stresses before and after the mainshock from static stress change and focal mechanism solutions. We derived a tectonic stress field model in the vicinity of the source area of the M9.0 North-eastern Japan Earthquake from modeling seismicity and analyzing earthquake focal mechanisms before and after the mainshock. The results show that the stress field in source region barely had any change before and after each large earthquake prior to the M9.0 mainshock. The stress state did not change in the places where are distant away from the rupture center of the M9.0 mainshock during its occurrence, with the azimuth of the maximum principal stress to be 290º, which is perpendicular to the strike of the Japan trench, and dip angle to be 19º. In comparison, the static stress has significant change in the central part of the source region after mainshock, with the occurrence of numerous normal fault type events. There exists an area with negative stress change in the source area of the M9.0 earthquake after the mainshock, with the P axis rotated from horizontal to vertical, which are responsible for numerous normal faulting events, where was dominated by thrust faulting prior to the mainshock. This pattern indicates a complete stress and strain release or locally stresses regime change. Our results provide a constrain to the stress accumulation- release pattern spatially and temporally for the source region of 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. We suggested that the seismicity pattern, may provide some valuable information on the stages of stress accumulation, and thus may be used for estimation of earthquake risk.\nKEYWORDS\nSource Region, Stress Change, 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, Earthquake Prediction.",

The MDB is the country’s primary agricultural area with scarce water resources impacted by climate change and extensive zones with degrading riparian vegetation.\nWe advance our understanding of the relationship between climate-driven flooding dynamics and vegetation response at the sub-continental to local and inter to intra-annual scale based on two decades of Landsat and one decade of MODIS imagery.\nWe Landsat TM and ETM+ data to synoptically map spatially detailed dynamics of flooding with an internally consistent machine learning algorithm. We derived riparian phenology (Fig 1) from MODIS data and attributed differences in vegetation response to flooding dynamics, vegetation types and sub-basin land use.\nVegetation community response to flooding varied in space and time and with vegetation types, densities and location relative to areas frequently flooded. Phenological degradation trends were observed over riparian forests and woodlands in the middle and lower parts of the basin that are primarily farmed and were we identified flooding regimes to have changed the most to less frequent and smaller inundation extents. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation phenology followed primarily a boom and bust cycle related to less extensive flooding dynamics. This pattern was found across different areas of the basin. As expected, flooding regimes and vegetation response patterns were fine grained confirming the choice of a spatially explicit, internally consistent analysis leading the path for ongoing monitoring.\nRemote sensing-based monitoring of the response of riparian vegetation to flooding can be used to quantify spatially explicit changes in vegetation community response as the result of climate variability and change and outcomes of land and water management decisions with applicability to other areas globally such as the Nile river basin and Okavango River delta in Africa or the Mekong River Basin in Southeast Asia).",

            "abstract": "Reliable climate-change projections of extreme precipitation events are of great interest to decision makers, due to potentially important hydrological impacts such as floods, land slides and debris flows. Low-resolution climate models generally project increases of heavy precipitation events with climate change, but there are large uncertainties related to the limited spatial resolution and the parameterized representation of atmospheric convection. \nHere we employ a convection-resolving version of the COSMO model across an extended region (1100 km x 1100 km) covering the European Alps to investigate the differences between parameterized and explicit convection in climate-change scenarios. We conduct 10-year long integrations at resolutions of 12 and 2km. Validation using ERA-Interim driven simulations reveals major improvements with the 2km resolution, in particular regarding the diurnal cycle of mean precipitation and the representation of hourly extremes. In addition, 2km simulations replicate the observed super-adiabatic scaling at precipitation stations, i.e. peak hourly events increase faster with temperature than the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of 7%/K (see Ban et al. 2014).\nConvection-resolving climate change scenarios are conducted using control (1991-2000) and scenario (2081-2090) simulations driven by a CMIP5 GCM (i.e. the MPI-ESM-LR) under the IPCC RCP8.5 scenario. Comparison between 12 and 2km resolutions with parameterized and explicit convection, respectively, reveals close agreement in terms of mean summer precipitation amounts (decrease by 30%), and regarding slight increases of heavy day-long events (amounting to 15% for 90th-percentile for wet-day precipitation). However, the different resolutions yield large differences regarding extreme hourly precipitation, with the 2km version projecting substantially faster increases of heavy hourly precipitation events (about 30% increases for 90th-percentile hourly events). \n\nBan, N., J.

Based on the tectonic reconstruction of these ACs, the OPS at Porth Felen has the oldest depositional age. Our new U-Pb date of detrital zircons separated from the turbidite sandstones at Porth Felen has the youngest age of 580±13 Ma. These results suggest that the black mudstones at Porth Felen were deposited no later than the early Ediacaran. We have analyzed these black mudstones by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, and found that about a quarter of their iron content is contained in pyrite, while the other components are paramagnetic Fe2+ or occasionally paramagnetic Fe3+ in clay minerals. The red cherts in the younger OPS contain hematite as the main iron mineral, paramagnetic Fe3+, and paramagnetic Fe2+. The occurrence of hematite in a deep-sea chert essentially indicates a primary oxidizing depositional condition, whereas pyrite is indicative of a reducing environment. The present data confirm that a reducing deep-sea existed in the early Ediacaran during the black mudstone deposition, and that an oxidizing deep-sea had been established by the late Ediacaran. In conclusion, our results provide the first direct evidence of an actual deep open-ocean in the Ediacaran to clarify the timing and extent of the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event.",

In coupled subduction zones, tensional earthquakes are occasionally observed post a megathrust rupture, as tensional stress from slab pull is temporarily transmitted to the outer-rise. In this study we analyze some of the significant outer-rise events along the Sumatra-Andaman margin post 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, like those occurred on January 2005 (Mw=6.5), July 2005 (Mw=7.1), August 2009 (Mw=7.5 ), March 2010 (Mw=6.6) and June 2010 (Mw=7.5). We will be discussing the source parameters,kinematic rupture process, directivity and the average stress drop of these events which are derived using seismic body wave inversion. We adopted teleseismic body wave inversion methodology of Kikuchi and Kanamori (1982, 1986 and 1991). We will be discussing the stress drop patterns and a possible asperity model for this margin and compare with other major outer-rise events post Tohoku-Oki (2011) and Maule (2010) events. The stress regimes inferred from the P & T axis orientations and its temporal evolution from inter-seismic to post-seismic phase also will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Thermal state is an important property for us to understand the nature of the lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton (NCC). Traditionally, it was obtained by calculating equilibrium temperatures for the mantle xenoliths using thermometers based on major element compositions of coexisting minerals. A REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer developed by Liang et al. (2013) is able to extract near-solidus temperatures，which can deduce the thermal histories of mantle rocks in combination with major-element-in-two-pyroxene temperatures (Tmaj). We calculated REE temperatures (TREE) for mantle samples from the NCC including ancient refractory peridotites entrained by Early Cretaceous high-Mg diorites from the central NCC (Fushan), Mantle pyroxenites entrained by Early Cretaceous basalts from the eastern NCC (Feixian and Fangcheng), and fertile/moderately depleted peridotites entrained by <100 Ma basalts from the central and eastern NCC. The Fushan peridotites have low Tmaj (<880°C) and mismatched high TREE (780-1150°C), indicating that the ancient mantle was subjected to melt-rock reactions. The Feixian and Fangcheng pyroxenites have both high Tmaj (>890°C) and high TREE - Tmaj values (80-220°C), suggestive of a hot and fast-cooled mantle in Early Cretaceous. The peridotites in <100 Ma basalts have similar TREE and Tmaj, characteristics of well-equilibrated mantle.\nBased on the thermometric data, we suggest that the transition of nature of the NCC lithospheric mantle is marked by the interaction between ancient lithospheric mantle and hot melt derived from recycling lower crust in Early Cretaceous. After that a fertile mantle was accreted from upwelling asthenosphere, which accomplished the replacement of the NCC lithsospheric mantle.\n",

Using SDO/HMI vector magnetic field measurements we calculate vertical electric currents and discuss their role in the flare energy release. We argue that the observed fine structuring of the flare ribbons can be associated with dissipation of electric currents in the partially ionized chromospheric plasma. We also discuss the role of electric currents in two flares with sunquakes: C7.0 flare of Febrary 17, 2013, and M9.2 flare of July 30, 2011. We find that the observed sunquake impacts do not spatially correlate with the strongest HXR emission sources but coincide with the intensive electric currents. These observations suggest that the primary energy release can be connected with rapid dissipation of electric currents in the low atmosphere. We also conclude that the fine structuring of the electric currents may play a very important role, as it leads to enhanced and fast magnetic energy release, especially in the case of turbulent and ambipolar resistivity which can take place in the low solar atmosphere.",

Izumi et al (2013, GRL) and Li et al (2013, GRL) showed that several relationships and robust patterns occur in climate simulations across different climate states (i.e. past (cold), present, and future (warm)), and used paleo- and modern environmental data to provide some independent evidence for those relationships and patterns. Izumi et al (2014, Clim Dyn) examined the possibility that a small set of common mechanisms controls large-scale responses using a simple energy-balance model to decompose the temperature changes shown in multiple simulations. These and other studies demonstrate the way in which paleoclimate simulations are useful adjuncts to analyses of modern-day climates in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of climate changes.\nHere, we further investigate change in the surface clear-sky longwave downward radiation, which is a key control of large-scale temperature responses such as land-ocean contrast and high-latitude amplification, by decomposing the this component into to direct longwave feedback, water vapor effect, and CO2 effect in a simple energy balance model. We also discuss the residual term in the decomposition, which measures the difference between the simulated CMIP5 surface temperature and surface temperature estimated by the energy balance model. In addition, we investigate the key mechanisms in mid-Holocene vs piControl climates in order to compare the responses from orbitally induced changes in insolation with the responses induced by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Finally, we explore other large-scale climate responses under different climate states, in particular precipitation and water-balance variables over land, focusing on the large-scale atmospheric circulation of moisture variations.",

            "abstract": "Ship engine emissions are important regarding lung and cardiovascular diseases in coastal regions worldwide. Bio mass burning is made responsible for adverse health effects in many cities and rural regions. The Virtual Helmholtz Institute-HICE (www.hice-vi.eu) addresses chemical & physical properties and health effects of anthropogenic combustion emissions. Typical lung cell responses to combustion aerosols include inflammation and apoptosis, but a molecular link with the specific chemical composition in particular of ship emissions has not been established. Through an air-liquid interface exposure system (ALI), we exposed human lung cells at-site to exhaust fumes from a ship engine running on common heavy fuel oil (HFO) and cleaner-burning diesel fuel (DF) as well as to emissions of wood combustion compliances. A special field deployable ALI-exposition system and a mobile S2-biological laboratory were developed for this study. Human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 etc.) are ALI-exposed to fresh, diluted (1:40-1:100) combustion aerosols and subsequently were toxicologically and molecular-biologically characterized. Advanced chemical analyses of the exhaust aerosols were combined with transcriptional, proteomic and metabolomic profiling to characterise the cellular responses. The HFO ship emissions contained high concentrations of toxic compounds (transition metals, organic toxicants) and particle masses. The cellular responses included inflammation and oxidative stress. Surprisingly, the DF ship emissions, which predominantly contain rather “pure” carbonaceous soot and much less known toxicants, induced significantly broader biological effects, affecting essential cellular pathways (e.g., mitochondrial function and intracellular transport). Therefore the use of distillate fuels for shipping (this is the current emission reduction strategy of the IMO) appears insufficient for diminishing health effects. The study suggests rather reducing the particle emissions by secondary measures (filters) than shifting the fuel. In the case of wood combustion the reduction of soot and carcinogenic aromatic compounds is suggested. However, for both sources (wood and ship diesel) we found that effects of the gaseous pollutants (e.g. aldehydes) are potentially problematic.",

Obviously the first approach requires a\nthermalized distribution to yield meaningful results, while the second approach is universally valid.\nHowever, in both cases the shape of the distribution can not be reproduced by the derived parameters.\nFrom observations of solar wind protons and alpha particles it is known that the assumption of a thermalized\ndistribution is not valid, at least for the majority of observations.

These naturally yield deviations from Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions.\nTo address this problem we have analyzed ten years worth of data from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS)\nand the Magnetometer (MAG) on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). From our analysis we obtained reduced 1D\nvelocity spectra in 12 minute cadence for some 40 solar wind ions, from protons and alpha particles up to iron.\nUsing the magnetic field vector information we were able to study periods where the reduced 1D spectra represent\nthe parallel and perpendicular shape of the velocity distributions.

The review and update was conducted by an international team, drawn from both the biological science and Mars exploration communities, to understand when and where Special Regions could, and likely do, occur. The study applied recently available data about Mars environments and about Earth organisms, building on a previous analysis of Mars Special Regions (2006) undertaken by a similar team. Since then, a large new body of highly relevant data has been generated from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (launched 2005), Phoenix (2007), and from Mars Express and the twin MER landers (all 2003). Additional results were also gleaned from the Mars Science Laboratory (2011). In addition to Mars data, there is a considerable body of new data regarding the known environmental limits to life on Earth—including the potential for terrestrial microbial life to survive and replicate under martian environmental conditions.\nThe analysis of Mars Special Regions included:\n1. An extensive analysis of both new and previously unavailable data regarding the environmental limits of life on Earth, including both experimental results and environmental observations;\n2. An examination of extensive post-2006 observational data sets, including high spacial and temporal resolution data from orbit and new data from landed spacecraft;\n3. New models of Mars relevant to natural environmental variation in water activity and temperature;\n4. Review and reconsideration of the current parameters used to define Special Regions; and\n5. Updated maps and descriptions of the Mars environments that are recommended for treatment as “uncertain,” or “special”, including the identification of locations on Mars for which we cannot demonstrate are not special.\nSeveral significant changes in our appreciation of the capabilities of Earth organisms and the availability of Mars environments have led to a new appreciation of the potential for Mars Special Regions to be identified and protected.",

These distributions will typically be calculated from large ensembles produced by a climate model and require large computational resources. Here we discuss an alternative based on a simple algorithm to produce ensembles of surrogate fields based on observations or a few climate model experiments.\nThis method can be seen as a field extension of bootstrapping as it produces surrogate fields with the same spatial and temporal structure (as measured with lagged cross-correlations) as the target field. We have previously used this method in tests of paleo-reconstruction methods and in a study of the significance of warm records.\nIn this study the method will be used for event detection. We will in particular be interested in recent European extreme warm events and cold spells. The method allow us to address issues such as the relative effects of the two aspects of climate change: the change in the mean and the change in the variance. We will also address the selection problem. Some studies consider a single geographical site where an extreme event has been observed and investigate the probabilities for such an event at that particular site. However, considering the probability for a similar event in an extended area will give different probabilities and may result in different conclusions regarding the attribution.",

Inorganic silicate fractions of samples from ODP Leg 199, Hole 1215A, located in the central Pacific Ocean (26°N, 147.5°W), were investigated for 143Nd/144Nd compositions, in order to constrain the sources of eolian dust and determine the latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) recorded in the core. 143Nd/144Nd values of eolian dust show a close agreement with those of Asian dust for the last 20 million years, but are much higher than those of Asian dust for the most of 20 - 30 Ma period. Drastic shift in 143Nd/144Nd values at ~20 Ma is associated with changes in compositions of other geochemical attributes (Eu anomaly and La/Sc, Ziegler et al., 2007, EPSL, v. 254, 416-432), indicating changes in sources of eolian dust at ~ 20 Ma. Geochemical compositions of eolian dust in the 20-30 Ma section resemble those of southeast equatorial Pacific surface and down-core dust records. The observed changes, thus, are attributed to the shift of its eolian dust sources from South/Central American to Asian dust due to the southward movement of the ITCZ over the study site. Our results indicate paleolocation of the ITCZ at ~ 20°N at 20 Ma. An exceptional 143Nd/144Nd value at ~28 Ma revealing Asian dust signal might indicate that the ITCZ had fluctuated in a wide latitudinal range during the 20 - 30 Ma period characterized by a series of glacial episodes.",

            "abstract": "The last glacial-interglacial fluvial archive of the Upper Thames catchment, UK has received much attention over the past 50 years. Extensive exposures within the Pleistocene sequence have yielded a vast array of field observations, constrained by a substantive, but still inadequate, geochronological dataset. This catchment was not glaciated during this period, lying well beyond the Devensian (MIS2) ice margin, and thus landscape morphological evolution progressed largely in response to variation in fluvial and slope processes forced primarily by climate-driven hydrological and vegetation change. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support any significant tectonic-driven change, albeit fluvial system evolution progressed within the context of long-term regional uplift. The relative simplicity of process interactions within this catchment over the timeframe of interest, taken together with its comprehensive sedimentary record, makes the Upper Thames archive a good candidate for comparison with landscape evolution model outputs.\nIn this paper we present a ‘first look’ at the performance of PARALLEM, a new, parallel-coded, landscape evolution model, with results presented from an initial 50,000-year simulation. In this instance PARALLEM was deployed in annual, steady-flow mode. The model is driven by changing precipitation and temperatures. A pre-determined precipitation input data series was used, based upon a simple transfer function which utilises an up-sampled North Atlantic SST record, together with a modified temperature series based upon palaeoecological data. PARALLEM explicitly models mass-movement processes (i.e. creep, gelifluction) and surface erosion by flowing water (i.e. diffuse and concentrated erosion) using formulae derived from empirical modern-day process data. The model also deploys a simple logistic growth/die-back model for vegetation driven by hydrological and temperature change. Sediment transport is modelled using a modified transport-distance approach.\nComparison of the two datasets is problematical as there are few, if any, attributes that can directly be compared. As a consequence we will discuss some of the obstacles which limit comparison of the field and model data and suggest how some of these might be overcome.",

            "abstract": "Ocean waves change alongshore topographies and their effects reach to ecological systems and coastal infrastructures. Ocean waves are mainly formed by sea surface wind, then variations in sea surface winds can cause changes in ocean waves. Under the condition of global warming, atmospheric motion will change in future climate and they will give changes in wave climates. However, effects of global warming on wave climate have not yet investigated in detail. In this study, a dynamic downscaling method by a weather prediction model (WRF developed by NCAR) is applied to obtain detail information of sea surface wind in the present and future climates. The ocean wave is simulated by a wave model (WaveWatch-III developed by NOAA) with the downscaled wind in the present and future climate, then variations in wave climate in future are investigated. For future climate, climate projections in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) are used. For future scenario, the representative concentrate pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) is selected. Variations of ocean waves in the Sea of Japan is focused in this work. Over the Sea of Japan, the strong northwesterly blows from the Eurasian Continent to the Japan islands in winter and causes high waves, and sometimes it causes marine accidents and breaks in coastal civil structures. The results of WaveWatch-III showed that the maximum value of significant wave height becomes smaller in the northern and central part of the Sea of Japan, however, clear increases are found in the southern part in future. In some regions, the maximum wave heights in future become 4 meter larger than in present. On the other hand, there are variations in frequency distribution of significant wave height. The frequency of modestly high waves increases and the low wave frequency decreases mainly in January and February (even in areas with smaller maximum significant wave height in future). Without extremely high ocean waves, variations in frequency distribution on ocean wave will affect alongshore sediment transport and topography.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 150 years the Rhône River has been heavily altered by human infrastructures. The first wave (1860 - 1930) of modifications consisted of dikes and groynes designed to narrow the channel and promote incision in order to facilitate navigation. A second period (1948 - 1986) involved the construction of a series of canals and dams for hydroelectricity production. These works bypass multiple reaches of the original channel and drastically reduce the discharge and sediment load reaching them. A comprehensive study underway is aimed at describing the present-day morphology of the Rhone along its 512 km length from its source at Lake Geneva to its sink at the Mediterranean Sea and quantifying the role of management works in the evolution to its current state.\nGrainsize distributions and armour ratios were determined using a combination of Wolman counts on bars and in shallow channels and dredge samples collected from a boat in navigable reaches. Long profiles were constructed from historical bathymetric maps and bathymetric data collected between 1950 – 2010. Differential long profiles highlighting changes in bed elevation due to sediment storage and erosion were analyzed for three different periods: post-channelization, post-dam construction, and a recent period of major floods.\nResults show a complex discontinuous pattern in grainsize associated with hydraulic discontinuities imposed by dams. The D50 for bypass reaches is 45 mm compared to a D50 of 34 mm in the non-bypass reaches. The lower D50 as well as a finer tailed distribution in non-bypass reaches reflects fining associated with storage upstream of dams. Armour ratios are on average around 2 but are notably higher for reaches in the middle section of the Rhone.\nThe average incision rate was 1.8 cm/yr for the period of post-channelization and 1.2 cm/yr following dam construction, suggesting the post-dam Rhone was already partially armoured due to incision associated with channelization preceding dam construction. A period marked by large floods between 2001 – 2003 had an average incision rate of approximately 3 cm/yr. Changes in bed elevation for this period highlight destocking and restocking of fine sediments in reservoirs upstream of dams. Only a few downstream reaches where floods were most intense and grainsize is finer were truly active.",

In addition, visibility at Deagu Weather Station (DWS) and water temperature at Gangjeong-Goryeong Weir data were used.\nThe meteorological characteristics at the Weir were observed as follows: summer (winter) temperature was higher (lower) than normal year; humidity was higher than that at DWS; and soil temperature was lower than water temperature that at Gangjeong-Goryeong Weir and soil temperature that at DWS. The water temperature at the Weir increased during the last 5 years.\nFog formation at the Wier was most frequently observed in the fall - generally during dawn or morning. When the fog occurs, wind direction was Southwest and soil temperature was lower than air temperature. Evaporation fog was the main type out of four fog types (radiation, advection, evaporation, and front) considered. This study will analyze the time series of the meteorological factors of the four fog types to assess the meteorological conditions during the fog formation.",

The transpressive movement is partitioned and accommodated in the Hispaniola region along two left-lateral strike-slip structures surrounding a fold-and-thrust belt. New multibeam bathymetry data and multichannel seismic reflection profiles have been recently collected during the Haiti-SIS and Haiti-SIS 2 cruises, along part of the northern Caribbean plate boundary between Cuba, Jamaica and Hispaniola. From the north to the south, three types of deformations are observed. In the Windward Passage, the analysis of the data set reveals that the movement on the Oriente fault between Cuba and Hispaniola is purely left-lateral strike-slip according to the GPS measurements. In the Gonave basin, west of Hispaniola, the deformation is compressive. A series of folds is identified and moves toward the southwest. The Enriquillo-Plantain-Garden Fault (EPGF) is localized in the Jamaica Passage, between Jamaica and Hispaniola. The analysis of the data set reveals that the left-lateral EPGF recently intersects inherited basins from the eastern Cayman Trough margin. The study of the actual EPGF active trace shows that this fault moves with a pure strike-slip component, at least in its western part: the presence of a little push-up structure and a set of three en echelon folds is highlighting in the western part of the Jamaica Passage. The shortening rate in the inherited basins crossed by the EPGF increases from west to east (5.8% to 8.5%), indicating that a thrusting component is also accommodated around the EPGF.",

In particular we study the behavior of a fluid-saturated fault under shear, based on the assumption that the fabric presents rate- and temperature dependent response to shear loading. A creeping fault of this type can, under certain conditions, produce excess heat due to shear heating, reaching temperatures which are high enough for triggering endothermic chemical reactions. We focus on the decomposition reactions and incorporate excess pore pressure generation and variations of the porosity due to the chemical effects (a process called chemical pressurization). After deriving the corresponding system of equations in the region of the ultra-cataclastic core, we study the influence of the model parameters, namely the frictional, hydraulic and chemical properties of the material, along with the boundary conditions of the problem, on the behavior of the fault and through a non-linear bifurcation analysis we provide regimes of stable-frictional sliding and pressurization. Furthermore, the system is integrated in time to extract its temporal behavior, providing regimes of stable creep, non-periodic and periodic seismic slip events due to chemical pressurization, depending on their frictional properties. It is shown that this chemically induced seismic slip is an ultra-localized event in the post failure regime. It takes place in an extremely narrow band, 2 orders of magnitude narrower than the initial one, verifying the field observations.",

The initial data, obtained during the first mission phases to the comet, allow us to derive albedo and global spectral properties of the comet nucleus as well as spectra of different areas on the nucleus.\nThe characterization of cometary nuclei surfaces and their comparison with those of related populations such as extinct comet candidates, Centaurs, near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), and primitive asteroids is critical to understanding the origin and evolution of small solar system bodies.\nThe acquired VIRTIS data are used to compare the global spectral properties of comet 67P/CG to published spectra of other cometary nuclei observed from ground or visited by space mission. Moreover, the spectra of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko are also compared to those of primitive asteroids and centaurs.

            "abstract": "An adequate quantification of groundwater recharge is required for sustainable water resource management and robust hydrological model predictions. However, estimation of the future temporal evolution of groundwater recharge rates at annual, seasonal or daily time scales remains a challenging task due to the strong linkage of infiltration processes with predicted changes of the frequency distribution of precipitation. While many studies have addressed recharge processes under climate change scenarios, only limited work has been carried out systematically focusing on the impact of precipitation variability.\nThus, we simulated groundwater recharge in the Swiss pre-Alpine Rietholzbach research catchment based on a water balance model, that was calibrated to daily direct recharge measured at a weighting lysimeter. Three approaches, employing different degrees of complexity, were utilized to obtain future climatic forcing functions. First, a relatively simple delta change factors approach for three stationary time periods was applied. For this scenario 10 different climate model chains were used to determine the predictive uncertainty accompanied with the different GCM (Global Circulation Model) x RCM (Regional Climate Model) combinations. Second, these delta change values were combined with a stochastic weather generator, which allows for a more realistic simulation of climatic variability compared to the simple delta change downscaling approach. Further, additional uncertainty, linked to natural climate variability in the climatic forcing functions, can be determined more efficiently. Finally, the frequency distribution of precipitation events was artificially adjusted to account for a larger amount of extreme events, thus simulating what is expected for the future.\nThe first simulations indicate that annual recharge is less affected by changes of the frequency distribution of precipitation, however there was a marked impact on the seasonal signal. All approaches demonstrated that the uncertainty of projected recharge rates were relatively large. Preliminary results of the third modeling approach indicate that the impact of extreme precipitation events seems to be underestimated in many climate change impact studies.",

Because of the large size of the body of sand (21.5 million m3) and the position at the coastline and near coastal dunes, the Sand Motor might cause a substantial increase of the fresh water availability by increasing the volume fresh water lens underneath the dunes. This creates an opportunity to combine coastal protection with an increase of fresh water resources in coastal regions. With a three dimensional, density dependent, groundwater model the effects of changing morphology over time and the potential increase in fresh water availability have been studied.",

            "abstract": "In the last decades, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) has been proven to be one of the most valuable techniques to improve our understanding of the Earth's shape, gravity field and rotational motion. Apart from the ''traditional'' tasks of SLR, in the recent past the portfolio has been considerably widened. Especially the SLR-based orbit determination and orbit prediction of space debris objects is gaining increasing attention. The reliable and accurate orbit determination/prediction of debris objects is of crucial importance for any effort towards debris collision avoidance. Hitherto, this task is performed by space surveillance networks using ground-based radar tracking and passive optical tracking with telescopes. These methods, however, are characterized by low accuracy, ranging from several hundreds of meters to a few kilometers for low-Earth orbiting objects. As demonstrated successfully, SLR has the potential to considerably improve these numbers, and hence to improve debris surveillance.\nOne of the most severe limitations of the technique is the sparse network of SLR stations, and hence the sparseness of tracking data. Against this background, we propose to extend the existing SLR network by passive telescopes in combination with multi-static observations. Multi-static observations means that an object is tracked by only one active SLR station, but the diffusely reflected photons are detected at several passive stations (in case of only one passive station the measurements are referred to as bi-static). In order to demonstrate the performance of the principle, we analyzed (i) two-way laser ranges from Graz (3 passes), and (ii) two-way laser ranges from Graz (3 passes) in combination with bi-static measurements between the SLR stations Graz and Wettzell (3 passes); our investigations focus on the defunct ENVISAT satellite. We found the orbit determination/prediction results including bi-static observations to outperform single-station results by about one order of magnitude. For scenario (ii), our orbit prediction error ranges from 40m (prediction age 1 day) to 450m (prediction age 7 days). From our first experiments we conclude that bi-/multi-static SLR is capable to meet the requirements for debris surveillance, but might also be beneficial for more ''traditional'' applications.",

            "abstract": "Observations of volcanically induced seismicity are essential for eruption forecasting and for real-time and near-real-time warnings of hazardous volcanic activity. Studies of volcanic seismicity and of seismic wave propagation also provide critical understanding of subsurface magmatic systems and the physical processes associated with magma genesis, transport, and eruption. However, desipite significant advances in recent years, our ability to successfully forecast volcanic eruptions and fully understand subsurface volcanic processes is limited by our current understanding of the source processes of volcano-seismic events, the effects on seismic wave propagation within volcanic structures, limited data, and even the non-standardized terminology used to describe seismic waveforms. Progress in volcano seismology is further hampered by inconsistent data formats and standards, lack of state-of-the-art hardware and professional technical staff, as well as a lack of widely adopted analysis techniques and software. Addressing these challenges will not only advance scientific understanding of volcanoes, but also will lead to more accurate forecasts and warnings of hazardous volcanic eruptions that would ultimately save lives and property world-wide. Two recent workshops held in Anchorage, Alaska, and Oxford, UK, represent important steps towards developing a relationship among members of the academic community and government agencies, focused around a shared, long-term vision for volcano seismology. Recommendations arising from the two workshops fall into six categories: 1) Ongoing and enhanced community-wide discussions, 2) data and code curation and dissemination, 3) code development, 4) development of resources for more comprehensive data mining, 5) enhanced strategic seismic data collection, and 6) enhanced integration of multiple datasets (including seismicity) to understand all states of volcano activity through space and time. As presented sequentially above, these steps can be regarded as a road map for galvanizing and strengthening the volcano seismological community to drive new scientific and technical progress over the next 5-10 years.",

This diversity is normally interpreted as a distribution in climate sensitivity driven by some distribution of feedback mechanisms. Identification of these feedbacks relies on precise identification of the forcing to which each model is subject, including distinguishing true error from model diversity.\nThe Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) aims to disentangle the role of forcing from model sensitivity as determinants of varying climate model response by carefully characterizing the radiative forcing to which such models are subject and by coordinating experiments in which it is specified. RFMIP consists of four activities:\n1) An assessment of accuracy in flux and forcing calculations for greenhouse gases under past, present, and future climates, using off-line radiative transfer calculations in specified atmospheres with climate model parameterizations and reference models\n2) Characterization and assessment of model-specific historical forcing by anthropogenic aerosols, based on coordinated diagnostic output from climate models and off-line radiative transfer calculations with reference models\n3) Characterization of model-specific effective radiative forcing, including contributions of model climatology and rapid adjustments, using coordinated climate model integrations and off-line radiative transfer calculations with a single fast model\n4) Assessment of climate model response to precisely-characterized radiative forcing over the historical record, including efforts to infer true historical forcing from patterns of response, by direct specification of non-greenhouse-gas forcing in a series of coordinated climate model integrations\nThis talk discusses the rationale for RFMIP, provides an overview of the four activities, and presents preliminary motivating results.",

            "abstract": "Gas flaring is one of the most controversial energetic and environmental issues the Earth is facing, moreover contributing to the global warming and climate change. According to the World Bank, each year about 150 Billion Cubic Meter of gas are being flared globally, that is equivalent to the annual gas use of Italy and France combined. Besides, about 400 million tons of CO2 (representing about 1.2% of global CO2 emissions) are added annually into the atmosphere.\nEfforts to evaluate the impact of flaring on the surrounding environment are hampered by lack of official information on flare locations and volumes. Suitable satellite based techniques could offers a potential solution to this problem through the detection and subsequent mapping of flare locations as well as gas emissions estimation.\nIn this paper a new methodological approach, based on the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST), a multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis, was developed to analyze and characterize the flaring activity of the largest Italian gas and oil pre-treatment plant (ENI-COVA) located in Val d’Agri (Basilicata) For this site, located in an anthropized area characterized by a large environmental complexity, flaring emissions are mainly related to emergency conditions (i.e. waste flaring), being the industrial process regulated by strict regional laws. With reference to the peculiar characteristics of COVA flaring, the RST approach was implemented on 13 years of EOS-MODIS (Earth Observing System – Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data to detect COVA-related thermal anomalies and to develop a regression model for gas flared volume estimation. The methodological approach, the whole processing chain and the preliminarily achieved results will be shown and discussed in this paper. In addition, the possible implementation of the proposed approach on the data acquired by the SUOMI NPP – VIIRS (National Polar-orbiting Partnership - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and the expected improvements will be also discussed.",

            "abstract": "During northward passes over Mercury's dayside hemisphere, the MESSENGER spacecraft normally enters the dayside magnetosphere before it descends to below ~ 500 km altitude. However, for some of these dayside passes the dayside magnetosphere is completely absent in the magnetometer (MAG) and Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) observations. During these “disappearing\" dayside magnetosphere passes the MESSENGER measurements indicate that the spacecraft passed directly from the magnetosheath into the northern magnetospheric cusp and, finally, the high latitude nightside magnetosphere. Likely causes of these unusual events are severe reconnection-driven erosion and/or solar wind compression of the dayside magnetosphere, to the point where the closed field line dayside magnetosphere lies equatorward and/or below the orbit of MESSENGER. A survey of such cases in the MESSENGER data is presented. The hypothesis that these events are produced by extreme dayside magnetosphere reconnection and/or solar wind compression, is tested using ENLIL predictions of solar wind conditions at Mercury orbit and analysis of the MESSENGER measurements in the cusp and high-latitude nightside magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Core-log integration has been applied for rock mechanics studies in scientific ocean drilling since 2007 in plate subduction margins such as Nankai Trough, Costa Rica margin, and Japan Trench. State of stress in subduction wedge is essential for controlling dynamics of plate boundary fault. One of the common methods to estimate stress state is analysis of borehole breakouts (drilling induced borehole wall compressive failures) recorded in borehole image logs to determine the maximum horizontal principal stress orientation. Borehole breakouts can also yield possible range of stress magnitude based on a rock compressive strength criterion. In this study, we constrained the stress magnitudes based on two different rock failure criteria, the Mohr-Coulomb (MC) criteria and the modified Wiebols-Cook (mWC) criteria. As the MC criterion is the same as that under unconfined compression state, only one rock parameter, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is needed to constrain stress magnitudes. The mWC criterion needs the UCS, Poisson’s ratio and internal frictional coefficient determined by triaxial compression experiments to take the intermediate principal stress effects on rock strength into consideration. We conducted various strength experiments on samples taken during IODP Expeditions 334/344 (Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project) to evaluate reliable method to estimate stress magnitudes. Our results show that the effects of the intermediate principal stress on the rock compressive failure occurred on a borehole wall is not negligible.",

Measurements of temperature gradient and crustal rheology are concentrated in the upper crust, whereas the majority of the lithospheric measurements are approximated using empirical depth-dependent functions. We have applied a Monte Carlo approach to test the variation of crustal heat flow with temperature-dependent conductivity and the redistribution of heat-producing elements. The dense population of precision heat flow data in Victoria, Southeast Australia offers the ideal environment to test the variation of heat flow. A stochastically consistent anomalous zone of impossibly high Moho temperatures in the 3D model (> 900°C) correlates well with a zone of low teleseismic velocity and high electrical conductivity. This indicates that transient heat transfer has perturbed the thermal gradient and therefore a steady-state approach to 3D modelling is inappropriate in this zone. A spatial correlation between recent intraplate volcanic eruption points (< 5 Ma) and elevated Moho temperatures is a potential origin for additional latent heat in the crust.",

This work is presently conducted in the framework of the Franco-Chinese LIA-MONOCL\nThanks to the Westpac project, we had access to sediments collected in the deltas of the main rivers feeding the South China Sea from about 25°N to the equator. This is represented on the Asian continent by the Pearl river, the Red River, the Mekong river, by Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo regions with minor rivers but also contributing to the South China Sea, and finally by Luzon and Taiwan. The geological formations contributing to the river sediment discharges are different from one catchment basin to another as well as the present climatic conditions.\nThe magnetic analyses consist in the analysis of low-field magnetic susceptibility, ARM acquisition and decay, IRM acquisition and decay, back-field acquisition, thermal demagnetization of 3-axes IRM, hysteresis parameters, and FORC diagrams. The obtained parameters all together allow us to define the nature of the magnetic grains and their grain size distribution when magnetite is dominant. Some degree of variability is observed at the river mouths, illustrating different geological sources at the local/regional scale. As an average, it appears that the Southern basin of the South China Sea is surrounded by regions richer in high coercivity magnetic minerals than the northern basin. This mineral is identified as hematite while magnetites (and sulfides) are more abundant in the north. These results are complementary to the clay mineral assemblages previously determined on the same samples.\nThe first steps of a similar study conducted on marine core-tops well distributed in the South China Sea will also be illustrated.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami-induced flooding represents one of the most dangerous natural hazards to coastal communities around the world, as exemplified by Tohoku tsunami of March 2011. In order to further understand this hazard and to design appropriate mitigation it is necessary to develop versatile, accurate software capable of simulating large scale tsunami propagation and interaction with coastal geomorphology on a local scale. One such software package is Fluidity, an open source, finite element, multiscale, code that is capable of solving the fully three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured meshes. Such meshes are significantly better at representing complex coastline shapes than structured meshes and have the advantage of allowing variation in element size across a domain. Furthermore, Fluidity incorporates a novel wetting and drying algorithm, which enables accurate, efficient simulation of tsunami run-up over complex, multiscale, topography. Fluidity has previously been demonstrated to accurately simulate the 2011 Tohoku tsunami (Oishi et al 2013) , but its wetting and drying facility has not yet been tested on a geographical scale. This study makes use of Fluidity to simulate the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and its interaction with Japan's eastern shoreline, including coastal flooding. The results are validated against observations made by survey teams, aerial photographs and previous modelling efforts in order to evaluate Fluidity's current capabilities and suggest methods of future improvement. The code is shown to perform well at simulating flooding along the topographically complex Tohoku coast of Japan, with major deviations between model and observation arising mainly due to limitations imposed by bathymetry resolution, which could be improved in future. In theory, Fluidity is capable of full multiscale tsunami modelling, thus enabling researchers to understand both wave propagation across ocean basins and flooding of coastal landscapes down to interaction with individual defence structures. This makes the code an exciting candidate for use in future studies aiming to investigate tsunami risk elsewhere in the world.\nOishi, Y. et al.

Participants in the camp included Elders, classroom teachers, local resource managers and planners, community members, and climate scientists.

            "abstract": "As a chemically inert greenhouse gas in the troposphere with lifetimes up to 50 years but active in ozone destruction in the stratosphere, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) plays a major role in the atmospheric chlorine budget and is widely considered strictly of anthropogenic origin deriving from numerous industrial processes and products. However, satellite remote sensing studies have shown higher concentrations at the Equator, and earlier work has suggested possible biogenic sources. Here we present highly vertically-resolved atmospheric gradients of CCl4 within and above a primary rainforest ecosystem from three towers in the Central Amazon. The observed buildup of CCl4 mixing ratios near the top of the main canopies provides new evidence for a potentially large biogenic source from the Basin. By demonstrating the need to represent tropical forests as biogenic sources of CCl4, our study may help narrow the gap between remote sensing observations of CCl4 and emission, chemistry, and transport models and therefore lead to improved predictions of its role in atmospheric chemistry and climate.",

The goal of this study is to characterize the radar backscatter response of vegetation in response to natural variations in moisture availability. This is an essential step to determine if there is role for radar in the detection and monitoring of water stress in vegetation.\nThe SnowScat scatterometer was installed on a tower above a maize canopy in Flevoland in the Netherlands from July to September 2013. Snowscat is a ground-based, fully polarimetric, coherent stepped frequency continuous wave scatterometer operating in the range of 9-18GHz. Since 2009, it has been employed in several field campaigns in Switzerland and Finland to investigate the backscatter characteristics of snow. This study is its first deployment in an agricultural setting.\nBackscatter was measured hourly at a range of azimuth and elevation angles. Regular destructive vegetation sampling and dielectric property measurements are used to monitor variations in the canopy water content, dielectric properties, and canopy growth. Meteorological data, soil moisture and temperature profiles, canopy air temperature profiles and NDVI data were also collected. Results will be presented to show the influence of canopy growth, hydrometeorological conditions and the canopy moisture content distribution on the radar backscatter as a function of frequency, polarization and elevation angle.",

            "abstract": "The accommodation of deformation in the Earth’s lithosphere typically results in a heterogeneous distribution of strain in the continental crust, which is a function of effective pressure, temperature and strain rate at different structural levels. In Northeast Brazil, the Borborema Province is characterized by an interconnected, crustal-scale shear zone system associated with a widespread granitic plutonism. Two of the most prominent structures of this system, the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones, are characterized by ~ 600 km long E-W striking mylonite belts in which strain localization processes are observed either in association with partial melting in the Patos strike-slip fault, or as zones of overprinting brittle-ductile deformation in the Pernambuco shear zone. Deformation mechanisms are distinct across the Patos shear zone, mainly marked by crystalline plasticity and diffusion creep in the high-temperature northern border, magmatic flow in the central region and dislocation creep coupled with microfracturing in the southern sector. The Espinho Branco migmatite (~ 565 Ma) acts as a weak rheological layer that accumulates strain in the northern portion of the fault. Alternatively, the absence of partial melting and the dominant cataclastic/plastic flow regime lead to grain-size sensitive strain localization at the southern border. The Pernambuco shear zone was nucleated at the vicinities of two granitoid batholiths at c.a. 588 Ma. Low-temperature mylonites adjacent to the batholiths show several microstructures indicating coeval activity of brittle-ductile deformation. Recent zircon U-Pb (SHRIMP) data on these mylonites yielded mean ages of ~ 539 Ma, suggesting successive events of thermal input and shearing within the structure. These features suggest that strain localization processes exert an important control on the rheology of the continental lithosphere; the accommodation of deformation in the middle crust is mainly attained by the presence of weak rheological layers such as a melt phase, which localizes strain via diffusion creep. On the other hand, the upper crustal levels are characterized by strain accumulation along pre-existing planar anisotropies through brittle-plastic mechanisms, therefore localizing deformation at the frictional-viscous transition.",

            "abstract": "Igneous sills represent an important contribution to upper crustal magma transport, acting as magma conduits and stores (i.e. as sill networks, or as nascent magma chambers). Complex sill-network intrusion in basin settings can have significant impact on subsurface fluid flow (e.g., water aquifer and hydrocarbon systems), geothermal systems, the maturation of hydrocarbons, and methane release. Models for these effects are critically dependent on the models for sill emplacement. This study focuses on staircase-geometry sills in the Faroe Islands, on the European Atlantic Margin, which are hosted in mechanically layered lavas (1-20 m thick) and basaltic volcaniclastic units (1-30 m thick). The sills range from 20-50 m thick, with each covering ~17 km2, and transgressing a vertical range of ~480 m. Steps in the sills are elliptical in cross section, and discontinuous laterally, forming smooth transgressive ramps, hence are interpreted as representing initial stages of sill propagation as magma fingers, which inflate through time to create a through-going sheet. Although steps correspond to the position of some host rock layer interfaces and volcaniclastic horizons, most interfaces are bypassed. The overall geometry of the sills is consistent with ENE-WSW compression, and NNW-SSE extension, and stress anisotropy-induced transgression. Local morphology indicates that mechanical layering suppressed tensile stress ahead of the crack tip, leading to a switch in minimum and intermediate stress axes, facilitating lateral sill propagation as fingers, and resulting in a stepped transgressive geometry.",

            "abstract": "The solid inner core is the most remote and inaccessible part of our planet but its structure and composition may provide a key record needed to reveal the timing and nature of the onset of Earth’s protective magnetic field generated and even of long-term changes in the way the mantle convects driving surface dynamics. Key to developing our understanding of the inner core is our ability to use seismic observations to constrain its structure on all scales. Seismic wave velocities are mostly sensitive to the atomic scale crystal structure, temperature and composition. On a larger scale the microstructure of the inner core, reflecting its deformation and crystallization history, can be probed by seismic studies of elastic anisotropy and anelasticity [Makinen & Deuss (2013) Geophys. J. Int. 194:401]. The inner core is at temperatures in excess of ~0.95Tm and interpretation of the properties and history of the inner core must therefore include careful understanding of the anelastic properties of HCP iron and its alloys.\nThe most recent study of the anelasticity of iron and iron alloys is now over a decade old [Jackson et al., (2000) J. Geophys. Res. 105:23605] and is limited to low pressure where iron adopts the body centered cubic (BCC) or face centered cubic (FCC) structure. It is now widely, although not universally, accepted that iron in the core adopts the hexagonally close packed (HCP) epsilon-iron structure stable above 10 GPa and there are currently no results that reveal the anelasticity of this core-forming phase.\nWe have used Zinc as a low pressure analogue for HCP-iron and measured its anelastic response as a function of frequency (periods 10-300s), temperature and pressure (P<7GPa). Our experiments use the D-DIA to apply a sinusoidally varying strain to the sample and a corundum elastic standard. We image changes in length of the sample and standard in response to the driving strain X-radiographically. The amplitude and phase of sample length change relative to that of the elastic standard gives us the effective Young’s modulus (amplitude) and internal friction (frequency dependent phase lag). Above ~0.7Tm, we observe significant reduction in the sample’s effective Young’s modulus and an increase in internal friction; both of these are frequency dependent.",

Recent interpretations of some of these depressions as explosive volcanoes (Michalski and Bleacher, 2013) have renewed the interest for this region. However, recent observations also show the discovery in this region of a series of outflow channels named Okavango Valles (Mangold and Howard, 2013). These channels formed in the Hesperian through catastrophic flows having deposited sediments as deltas in ephemeral lakes. The source area of these channels takes place in a region of widespread depressions and local collapse pits. A continuum of landforms exists from broad depressions (~100 km in length and 100s m in depth) and sharper collapse structures (<100 km in diameter). Given the link between these depressions and the presence of outflow channels, we interpret the collapse structures as resulting from a specific lithology with volatile-rich sediments (or megaregolith) buried at depth. Collapse may be due either to the melting of subsurface ice, or subsurface flows triggered by a change in the groundwater table, or the (less likely) dissolution of buried chemical sediments. Magmatic activity is not excluded: a regionally enhanced thermal flux during the Hesperian could have triggered ground ice melting, and could have initiated subsidence subsequently, but explosive volcanism at the surface is not necessary to explain the presence of large collapsed terrains.\nMichalski, J. and J.

            "abstract": "Bioindicators are biological processes, species or communities, which are used to assess changes in the environment or environmental quality. Theoretically, they could also be used to provide advanced warning of hazards. They are inexpensive, locally relevant, and can encourage stakeholder participation in early warning system development and maintenance. While bioindicators have been identified for environmental problems such as air pollution and water pollution, and have been used to assess health of ecosystems, little information is available on bioindicators for climate related hazards. This presentation reviews possible biodindicators for droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones, based on the results of a literature review. It will also present results from a household survey of 36 communities in Kenya, Ghana and Burkina Faso. Indigenous knowledge offers a wealth of potential bioindicators; including animal and insect behavior, and plant phenology. Yet significant study is needed to verify these indicators and evaluate them against criteria such as specificity, variability, monotonicity, practicality and relevance. Bioindicators may not be specific to individual hazards and may provide limited advanced warning, as response often occurs after the actual onset of the hazard. Furthermore, indicators may become increasingly unreliable due to climate change itself. There is a need for a large-scale assessment of hazard bioindicators, which should also include forecasts of bioindicator change under global warming, and a cost-benefit analysis of the value of integrating bioindicators into early warning systems. Lessons can be drawn from ethnopharmacology. Coordinated research on this topic could contribute to the resilience of both ecosystems and human livelihoods.",

            "abstract": "Large uncertainties preside over terrestrial carbon flux estimates on a global scale. In particular, the strongly coupled dynamics between net ecosystem productivity and disturbance C losses are poorly constrained. To gain an improved understanding of ecosystem C dynamics from regional to global scale, we apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model-data-fusion approach into the CArbon DAta-MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM). We assimilate MODIS LAI and burned area, plant-trait data, and use the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and maps of above ground biomass as prior knowledge for initial conditions. We optimize model parameters based on (a) globally spanning observations and (b) ecological and dynamic constraints that force single parameter values and parameter inter-dependencies to be representative of real world processes.\nWe determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of major terrestrial C fluxes and model parameter values on a global scale (GPP = 123 +/- 8 Pg C yr-1 & NEE = -1.8 +/- 2.7 Pg C yr-1). We further show that the incorporation of disturbance fluxes, and accounting for their instantaneous or delayed effect, is of critical importance in constraining global C cycle dynamics, particularly in the tropics. In a higher resolution case study centred on the Amazon Basin we show how fires not only trigger large instantaneous emissions of burned matter, but also how they are responsible for a sustained reduction of up to 50% in plant uptake following the depletion of biomass stocks. The combination of these two fire-induced effects leads to a 1 g C m-2 d-1reduction in the strength of the net terrestrial carbon sink.\nThrough our simulations at regional and global scale, we advocate the need to assimilate disturbance metrics in global terrestrial carbon cycle models to bridge the gap between globally spanning terrestrial carbon cycle data and the full dynamics of the ecosystem C cycle. Disturbances are especially important because their quick occurrence may have long-term effects on ecosystems. Our synthetic simulations show that while tropical ecosystems uptake may reach pre-disturbance level after a decade, biomass stocks would most likely need more than a century to recover from a single extreme disturbance event.",

            "abstract": "The breakup of Gondwana translated Madagascar southwards relative to Africa along the Davie Fracture Zone (DFZ). This fracture zone now forms the Transform Passive Continental Margin (TPCM) from Kenya to Mozambique. The Davie Ridge (DR), a transform marginal ridge, has formed along the DFZ between 5 and 2°S and 22 and 11°S, but with little expression in-between. It has been proposed that this marginal ridge was formed by the thermal effects of a passing Mid Ocean Ridge (MOR) during the separation of Gondwana. Plate kinematic reconstructions, however, constrained by ocean magnetic anomalies, show that the MOR only passed between the north and south expressions of the DR. Therefore the positive linear gravity anomalies of the DR cannot be attributed to the effects of a passing MOR, and some other mechanism must be found to explain their formation.\nInterpretation of seismic reflection profiles along the DR shows that the gravity highs occur adjacent to large basin structures. In the north this correlates with a basin-bounding basement high of ~Albian age, and in the south with the rift flank uplifts of the currently active Quirimbas graben. This suggests that the northern and southern DR segments are instead shoulder uplifts resulting from two separate extensional episodes during different stress regimes. These are the Cretaceous NE-SW extension during the breakup of the south Atlantic, and the E-W extension of the Neogene-recent Afar-East Africa rift system, respectfully. The lack of deformation and DR formation along the region of the TPCM passed by the MOR suggests it has been coupled by thermal effects and/or the injection of magma.",

Many observations have been provided by the WIND spacecraft and by the Cluster mission for which wave-particle interaction has been extensively studied. More recently, with the magnetic field observations from Venus Express, an abundance of quasi-monochromatic ULF waves (with frequency below and far enough from the local proton cyclotron frequency) have been identified by an automatic survey upstream from the Venusian bow shock. One objective of this study was first to derive the relative occurrence of such foreshock waves and proton cyclotron waves associated to local pickup ions linked to exospheric hydrogen previously reported upstream from the Venusian shock. The second objective was to compare with the observed properties of the similar ULF waves in the terrestrial foreshock and discuss their association with ion distributions. The transverse part of the power spectrum dominates the parallel part for the reported Venusian foreshock ULF waves. Most of the waves display left-hand polarization in the spacecraft frame. Taking into account the Doppler-shift by the high-speed solar wind, they may be right-hand polarized in the solar wind frame. These characteristics suggest that they are RH mode waves generated by a cyclotron resonant process in the ion foreshock region by the field aligned beam protons reflected at the shock as in the terrestrial case.",

            "abstract": "Developing, or choosing, appropriate climate projections for use in a particular context is challenging. To help with this, it is useful to distinguish between two types of climate projection information. First there is scientific knowledge about the range of plausible climate change. Such knowledge can synthesise a range of relevant evidence, may convey messages in qualitative terms only, and may also have attached confidence (e.g. as in IPCC assessments).This knowledge can be used in context setting but may also be sufficient information for qualitative impact applications aimed at narrative development. Secondly, there are projection data sets tailored for use in technical risk assessments. Although these two products draw on similar source material (primarily global and regional climate model output), the information they can contain about future climate can be quite different. Often in meeting user needs, only a subset of the range of plausible future climate is considered in application-ready products. This may be due to user needs for downscaled information which comes from limited models, or their need to work with a small number of multivariate scenarios which are best provided by the outputs of single climate models. In the push to create sophisticated datasets that meet demanding technical needs, the larger perspective of representativeness can go by the wayside, and there is a risk that data users will tacitly believe their data are representative of future change when in fact they may not be. Thus a key challenge for risk assessment is for projection providers and users to work in unison to ensure that the two aspects of knowledge and data are as harmonised as possible. These concepts will be illustrated using projection products from the Australian context, including a range of new national climate projection products developed recently to support applications in natural resources management planning.",

            "abstract": "Exploratory one-line coastal models have been used to investigate the formation and evolution of coastal geomorphic features developed on sandy coasts, and are often applied by engineers for coastline management. Existing one-line models discretise the coast in a Cartesian coordinate system, limiting the evolution of the coastline to the cardinal directions, inhibiting some models from handling complex coastal geometries with high plan-form curvature. We developed a vector-based one-line model using local shoreline coordinates in order to evolve complex coastline geometries more effectively, including islands. The vector-based approach aids model efficiency whilst allowing complex coastal forms such as headland bay beaches, spits, sand waves and islands to be modelled. The coastline is discretised into polygonal, trapezoid or triangular cells depending on the coastline geometry being considered and the shoreface evolves normal to the local shoreline configuration. As in existing one-line models, changes in shoreline position are driven by gradients in alongshore sediment flux, calculated as a function of breaking wave conditions and integrated across the shoreface depth (in this case using the CERC equation). Waves are transformed following Airy wave theory, assuming that depth contours are locally shore-parallel. Additional rules for refraction and diffraction in the shadow of headlands or coastal structures have also been incorporated. We demonstrate the model’s potential by applying it to the development of concave and convex shoreline features. In particular we focus on the formation and evolution of headland bay beaches in the lee of headlands or sea defences, exploring the influence of varying offshore wave climates on emergent morphologically steady crenulate bay forms. We compare numerical modelling results to predictions of empirical models for the equilibrium form of crenulate bays as well as examples from nature.",

            "abstract": "Floodplain grasslands have one of the highest productivities of non-cultivated ecosystems on Earth. They procure a wide variety of benefits to human beings. In Eastern Africa, grasslands of Echinochloa stagnina are primordial for pastoralists as highly productive dry-season grazing zones. Regular flooding is a critical property in maintaining their productivity and resulting services. Yet, construction of hydrologic infrastructure modifies the flooding regime of rivers and the consequences on downstream floodplain grasslands need to be assessed.\nThis presentation focuses on quantifying the productivity of the floodplain grasslands in the Tana River Delta, Kenya, in order to assess potential changes under varying flooding regimes. The interactions between growth and floods are explored firstly at an experimental site, then through the construction of a process-based plant growth model adapted to floodplain grasslands. The 15-month experiment consisted in quantifying daily growth rates under various rainfall, irrigation, cutting and flooding regimes . Floods increased growth rates three-folds, and high productivities were maintained after the floods. The cutting regime and contribution of non-flood water also influenced productivity. Modelling allowed exploring the underlying processes explaining such behaviour. In an exploratory endeavour, the productivity of the grassland at the ecosystem scale was assessed with the model for a variety of flood and non-flooded scenarios. Decreasing floods led to a drop in annual productivity that could have serious consequences for the livestock keeping activities of the zone.\nThis research highlights the importance of floods in the maintenance of high productivities for a floodplain grassland typical of East Africa, and maybe of the Sahelian band. The model, once further validated, could be used on other floodplain grasslands, such as those of the Niger delta. Results for the Tana River Delta would need to be discussed with the stakeholders so that proper action can be taken.",

This very low fluctuation activity is consistent with the fluctuations being part of the ambient turbulent spectrum known as the \"great power law in the sky\". The range of wavenumbers included in the Voyager study includes waves that are expected to be generated by unstable pickup ion distributions that are believed to be the parent population of the energetic neutral atoms making up the IBEX ribbon. The absence of fluctuations have important implications for the models that rely on the presence of turbulence to scatter the ions. The talk will discuss the evolution of ring-beam distributions produced from multiple primary ENA populations generated directly from the Alabama neutral atom transport model.

            "abstract": "Using high-precision U-Pb dating we are potentially able to determine timescales of porphyry emplacement and ore formation. Previous studies have suggested timescales of porphyry Cu formation ranging from <100 yr, based on modelling diffusive equilibrium between fluids and altered rocks [1], to as much as 1 Ma using U-Pb LA-ICP-MS and SHRIMP dating techniques on zircons [2], [3]. In contrast recent numerical simulations suggest Cu precipitation occurs in the range of 50-100 ka [4]. Therefore in order to better constrain timescales of porphyry Cu formation, we apply high precision U-Pb zircon geochronology, using the youngest zircon date to estimate the emplacement age of each porphyry [5].\nThis study focuses on the ~7 Ma Bajo de la Alumbrera Cu-Au deposit, NW Argentina. The deposit consists of a composite stock of dacitic porphyries. The relative timing of each porphyry intrusion is established based on clear cross-cutting relationships between different porphyry intrusions, which include the pre-mineralisation P2 porphyry, pre-syn-minerlisation EP3 porphyry, and the post-mineralisation LP3 and P4 porphyries.\nSingle zircon crystals from individual porphyry intrusions (P2, EP3, LP3, P4) in the Alumbrera deposit have been dated using CA-ID-TIMS, employing the ET2535 tracer solution for maximum precision and accuracy. All porphyries display protracted zircon crystal growth over 100-200 ka timescales. Using the youngest zircons from each of the porphyry intrusions, Cu mineralisation occurred on 10 ka timescales, similar to those proposed by recent numerical predictions [4]. Trace element and Hf isotopic analyses may reveal geochemical distinctions within the porphyry intrusions and record temporal changes in the magmatic evolution.\n",

            "abstract": "The importance of surface wave mode coupling when modelling body-wave phases by surface-wave mode summation is now well understood but many surface-wave tomography techniques continue to rely on the assumption of modes propagating independently from source to receiver. We present an investigation into the pitfalls of this assumption at periods shorter than about 50s. Synthetic tests are conducted using a finite difference solution of the elastic wave equation in 2D Earth models that consist of a region of lateral heterogeneity imposed on a laterally homogeneous background medium. Green's functions in the background medium are computed numerically and the finite difference algorithm is used only to compute the scattered wavefield produced by the heterogeneity, so this approach allows us to see how a single mode incident on the heterogenous region emerges from it as a multimode wavetrain. A combination of dispersion analysis and eigenfunction decomposition of the emergent wavefield is used to study the exact redistribution of energy among the surface-wave modes. This is then checked against theoretical multiple scattering methods which exploit the concept of invariant embedding and are able to exactly describe surface-wave mode coupling. The synthetic seismograms generated in our tests as described above are inverted using a multimode inversion technique which decomposes a waveform into a set of independent modes. We find strong artefacts in the path average models obtained by such an inversion. It is demonstrated that whilst the inversion is successful in cases where the measured modes are generated at the source, it fails in cases where any of the measured modes are generated by mode conversions along the horizontal path from source to receiver. Since inversion for path average medium properties is often the first part of two-step tomographic procedures, our results have strong implications for surface-wave tomography.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a significant precursor of sulfuric acid and sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. Field and model studies have revealed that heterogeneous reaction on mineral dusts seem to be an important sink for SO2. However, available kinetic data about heterogeneous reaction of SO2 on authentic mineral dusts are scarce and are mainly limited at low humidity relative (RH). In addition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is the predominant oxidant of SO2 in the aqueous phase, may be able to promote the heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 on mineral dusts, but little is known about this role that H2O2 may play. In this study, we investigated the uptake kinetics of SO2 on authentic mineral dusts in the absence and presence of H2O2 at different RHs using a filter-based reactor. Three different authentic mineral dusts, i.e., Asian dust storm particles (ADS), Arizona test dust (ATD) and Tengger Desert sand (TDS), were used. The initial gas phase concentration of SO2 and H2O2 is about 5 ppbv and 0.8 ppbv, respectively, the typical concentration in the atmosphere. The values of uptake coefficients, γBET, on these particles are on the order of 10-5 under dry condition. Interestingly, with increasing RH, the γBET decreases on ADS particles, but increases on ATD and TDS particles. The difference in the mineralogy composition of these dust samples seems to rationalize the discrepancy in SO2 uptake. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of H2O2 increases the γBET by 45-90% on ADS, 45-150% on ATD and 40%-105% on TDS as RH increases 0 to 90%. One possible explanation for the observed behavior are that H2O2 can immediately react with SO2 on the surface of mineral dusts. Our results suggest that the role of heterogeneous reaction on mineral dusts as a sink of SO2 or a source of sulfate in the atmosphere may be underestimated due to the excluding of the enhancement effect of H2O2 in current atmospheric models.",

The fact that the Earth’s land surface is, in general, a relatively poor reflector of Ku band energy, with the exceptions of inland water, salar and ice surfaces has enabled Earth-orbiting satellite radar altimeters to be used for land surface applications including mapping and measurement of river and lake systems. The high along-track sampling of Cryosat-2 altimeter in SAR mode (I8 KHz) offers the opportunity to recover high frequency signals over much of the Earth’s land surface, enhancing the inland water height retrieval capability. Constraining this application is the limited availability of SAR Full Bit Rate (FBR) data from Cryosat-2 over these land surfaces; however, for Sentinel-3 the SAR mode will be deployed widely over land. This paper will summarise the CRUCIAL aims and objectives and present preliminary inland water heights from retracked Cryosat-2 altimetric waveforms, including results over Lake Malawi, the Amazon, Mekong and Brahmaputra with validation against in situ and other satellite data where possible.",

            "abstract": "Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) plantations cover vast areas throughout Southeast Asia and are of great economic importance. This study has sought to increase our understanding of throughfall inputs under teak by analyzing the abiotic and biotic factors governing throughfall amounts and throughfall ratios in relation to three canopy phenophases (leafless, leafing, and leafed). There is no rain during the brief leaf senescence phenophase. Daily data was available for both throughfall volumes and depths as well as leaf area index. Detailed meteorological data were available in situ every ten minutes. Leveraging this high-resolution field data, we employed boosted regression trees (BRT) analysis to identify the primary controls on throughfall amount and ratio during each of the three canopy phenophases. Whereas throughfall amounts were always dominated by the magnitude of rainfall (as expected), throughfall ratios were governed by a suite of predictor variables during each phenophase. The BRT analysis demonstrated that throughfall ratio in the leafless phase was most influenced (in descending order of importance) by air temperature, rainfall amount, maximum wind speed, and rainfall intensity. Throughfall ratio in the leafed phenophase was dominated by rainfall amount which exerted 54.0% of the relative influence. The leafing phenophase was an intermediate case where rainfall amount, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit were most important. Our results highlight the fact that throughfall ratios are differentially influenced by a suite of meteorological variables during leafless, leafing, and leafed phenophases. Abiotic variables (rainfall amount, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and maximum wind speed) trumped leaf area index and stand density in their effect on throughfall ratio. The leafing phenophase, while transitional in nature and short in duration, has a detectable and unique impact on water inputs to teak plantations. Further work is clearly needed to better gauge the importance of the leaf emergence period to the stemflow hydrology and forest biogeochemistry of teak plantations.",

            "abstract": "The broadband Grafenberg array (Germany) has been installed in 1976 and, thanks to visionary scientists and network maintainers, the continuous data acquired has been preserved until today. Using state of the art pre-processing and cross-correlation techniques, we are able to extract cross-correlation functions (CCF) between sensor pairs.\nIt has been shown recently that, provided enough computation power is available, there is no need to define a reference CCF to compare all days to. Indeed, one can compare each day to all days, computing the \"all-doublet\". The number of calculations becomes huge (N vs ref = N calculations, N vs N= N*N), but the result, once inverted, is way more stable because of the N observations per day. This analysis has been done on a parallelized version of MSNoise (http://msnoise.org), running on the VEGA cluster hosted at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB, Belgium).\nHere, we present preliminary results of the analysis of two stations, GRA1 and GRA2, the first two stations installed in March 1976. The interferogram (observation of the CCF through time, see Figure) already shows interesting features in the ballistic wave shape, highly correlated to the seasons. A reasonably high correlation can still be seen outside the ballistic arrival, after +-5 second lag time. The lag times between 5 and 25 seconds are then used to compute the dv/v using the all-doublet method. We expect to evidence daily to seasonal, or even to longer period dv/v variations and/or noise source position changes using this method. Once done with 1 sensor pair, the full data of the Grafenberg array will be used to enhance the resolution even more.",

            "abstract": "Stimulation of enhanced geothermal system (EGS) reservoirs by fluid injection enhances reservoir permeability by inducing microearthquakes (MEQs). Observations during the 2012 stimulation of the reservoir showed a bimodal depth distribution of seismicity. During seven weeks of hydraulic stimulation of well NWG 55-29, ~90% of the MEQs occurred in the shallow reservoir (~500 m to ~1800 m), ~10% occurred adjacent to the bottom half of the open borehole (~2500 to ~3000 m), while no seismicity was observed in the intervening interval (~2000 m to ~2500 m). Analyses of frictional stability using spatial models for fluid pressure diffusion of injected fluids shows that the distribution of MEQs is consistent with an observed distressing-of and leak-through the casing. However, this is incapable of explaining the anomalous absence of seismicity at intermediate depths. Hence, we performed rate-state friction (RSF) experiments on five samples of drill cuttings that represent the discrete depths of the MEQs zones. The results, with the effects of applied normal stresses, mineral contents and calcite dissolution on frictional parameter a-b of each sample, indicate that the observation of MEQ depths is indeed consistent with experimentally determined distributions of frictional strength and stability posited to transition from stability at intermediate depth to instability both below and above.",

            "abstract": "The Okinawa trough, a back-arc basin formed behind the Ryukyu arc-trench system, southwest Japan, represents an active rifting zone associated with extension of the continental lithosphere. The basin is located at the southeastern margin of the Eurasian plate and characterized by axial rift valleys with over 1.0 km depth and ~100 km width. Previous studies suggest that the early rifting phase started late Miocene and crustal extension is currently active at a full rate of 30 to 50 mm/yr. Within the basin, numerous active hydrothermal vents are observed, suggesting that the crustal rifting enhances melt/heat transfer from the deep mantle up to the seafloor. However, internal structure beneath the back-arc basin and its relation to the rifting system are little documented. Complex regional tectonic setting, such as active collision in Taiwan to the west, oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea slab, and changing spreading rate along the rift axis, may also have significant influences on the thermal structure and flow within the mantle wedge, but their relative roles in controlling the rifting mode and magmatic supply are still poorly understood. As a step toward filling this gap in knowledge, we started a new 7-year project that consists of four two-dimensional active-source seismic experiments and extensive passive-source seismic observations along the Ryukyu arc. In 2013, active-source seismic data were collected on the first line that crosses the southernmost part of the Ryukyu arc-trench and Okinawa trough at 124-125°E. For refraction/wide-angle reflection analyses, a total of 60 ocean bottom seismographs were deployed with approximately 6 km spacing on a ~390-km-long profile. On the same line, multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiling was also carried out. Seismic velocity models obtained by first arrival tomography show that beneath the volcanic arc a thick layer (~10 km) of the middle crust with Vp = 6.0-6.8 km/s is developed, a typical feature in the major volcanic arc in the circum-Pacific region, but such thick layers are not observed beneath the Okinawa trough. Correspondingly, crustal thickness significantly varies: Crust thins from over 20 km beneath the volcanic arc to ~15 km beneath the back-arc basin.",

            "abstract": "We describe a Micromagnetics, Inc. magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) scanning microscope developed for the University of Cambridge Nanopaleomagnetism Lab. The MTJ sensor used contains a thin film multilayer structure, whose core consists of two ferromagnetic electrodes, separated by an insulating layer. One of the electrodes is magnetically pinned via exchange bias to an antiferromagnetic layer, while the other is free to react to an external magnetic field. The magnetization of the pinned layer is fixed in a perpendicular direction, so this ferromagnetic junction can be used as a low-field magnetic sensor. The magnetoresistance of the junction is dependent on the magnetic orientation of the electrodes, and is quantified as the percent change between the low and high resistance states. The higher its value, the more sensitive the device is, which makes the MTJ sensor (magnetoresistance exceeding 200%) particularly attractive for detecting small-scale magnetic structures. The MTJ sensor does not require the use of cryogens, enabling straightforward, low-cost operation of the microscope. The lack of cryogen technology means the sensor can be brought close to the sample surface, routinely allowing for sample-to-sensor distances of 15-20 μm. Scan height depends on factors such as scanning mode (if using a static or vibrating stage), sample surface configuration, or sensor configuration (i.e., proximity of the sensor to the tip of the die). This renders the MTJ microscope capable of producing magnetic images that may resolve features as small as 15 μm, and of detecting field intensities lower than 1 μT. This technology is particularly useful for detecting stray fields from micro-regions of interest preserving the original paleomagnetic signature within a bulk sample that may also contain remagnetised regions. Examples include ancient or altered rocks, extraterrestrial materials, samples containing inclusions or exsolution structures, and in general specimens characterised by spatial heterogeneity. In addition, the high-resolution capability of the MTJ microscope makes it extremely useful for investigating sedimentary archives formed under low accumulation conditions (e.g., speleothems, stromatolites, Fe-Mn nodules) that hold a detectable environmental magnetic signal.",

            "abstract": "This talk explores the mechanisms underlying global-scale feedbacks of vegetation on climate, with a special focus on arid and transitional (semi-arid) regions and cross-scale interactions.\nWhether precipitation and temperature are known to be two of the major drivers of ecosystem dynamics, the inference of the forcing of vegetation on climate from observed data still leads to extremely contradictory results. This is mainly due to the intrinsic complex and nonlinear nature of climate-vegetation interactions, which is exerted over a wide range of space, temporal and frequency scales. Beside, traditional statistical tools applied to these feedbacks rely on linear correlation measures that can hardly distinguish the different components of these interactions.\nWe analyze monthly and sub-monthly globally gridded data of precipitation, temperature and NDVI (from both MODIS and AVHRR) by using an ensemble of different directional coupling statistics, and spectral metrics able to resolve cross-scale interactions.\nBased on the concept of Granger causality, we assess the bi-directional causal influences between precipitation, temperature and NDVI. In particular, we focus on spectral causality measures, in order to infer sub-processes acting across different time and frequency scales.\nSeveral examples from arid and semi-arid regions are introduced and examined. During the discussion of the result, we highlight the strength and weakness of the approach, also in the occurrence of nonlinear couplings.",

            "abstract": "Measurements on a set of cold-water corals (mainly Desmophyllum dianthus) have suggested that their clumped isotope composition could serve as a promising proxy for reconstructing paleocean temperatures. Such measurements have also offered support for certain isotope models of coral calcification. However, there are differences in the clumped isotope compositions between warm-water and cold-water corals, suggesting that different kinds of corals could have differences in their biocalcification processes. In order to understand the systematics of clumped isotope variations in cold-water corals more fully, we present clumped isotope data from a range of cold-water coral species from the tropical Atlantic and the Southern Ocean.\nOur samples were either collected live or recently dead (14C ages < 1,000 yrs) with associated temperature data. They include a total of 11 solitary corals and 1 colonial coral from the Atlantic, and 8 solitary corals from the Southern Ocean. The data indicate that coral clumped isotope systematics may be more complicated than previously thought. For example, for the genus Caryophyllia we observe significant variations in clumped isotope compositions for corals which grew at the same temperature with an apparent negative correlation between Δ47 and δ18O, different to patterns previously observed in Desmophyllum. These results indicate that existing isotope models of biocalcification may not apply equally well to all corals. Clumped isotope vital effects may be present in certain cold-water corals as they are in warm-water corals, complicating the use of this paleoclimate proxy.",

            "abstract": "Cenozoic volcanic outcrops in Arabia - locally known as harrats - span more than 2000 km along the western half of the Arabian plate, from eastern Yemen to southern Syria. The magmatism is bimodal in character, with older volcanics (30 to 20 My) being tholeiitic-to-transitional and paralleling the Red Sea margin, and younger volcanics (12 Ma to Recent) being transitional-to-strongly-alkalic and aligning in a more north-south direction. The bimodal character has been attributed to a two-stage rifting process along the Red Sea, where the old volcanics would have produced from shallow sources related to an initial passive rifting stage, and young volcanics would have originated from one or more deep-seated mantle plumes driving present active rifting. Early models suggested the harrats would have resulted from either lateral flow from the Afar plume in Ethiopia, or more locally from a separate mantle plume directly located under the shield. Most recently, tomographic images of the Arabian mantle have suggested the northern harrats could be resulting from flow originating at a deep plume under Jordan. In this work, we investigate the location of deep mantle plumes under the Arabian plate by mapping transition zone thickness with teleseismic receiver functions. The transition zone is bounded by seismic discontinuities, nominally at 410 and 660 km depth, originating from phase transitions in the olivine-normative component of the mantle. The precise depth of the discontinuities is strongly dependent on temperature and, due to the opposing signs of the corresponding Clapeyron slopes, positive temperature anomalies are expected to result in thinning of the transition zone. Our dataset consists of ~5000 low-frequency (fc < 0.25 Hz) receiver function waveforms obtained at ~110 broadband stations belonging to a number of permanent and temporary seismic networks in the region. The receiver functions were migrated to depth and stacked along a ~2000 km long record section displaying P-to-S conversions at seismic discontinuities under Western Arabia. Our results display a normal to thicker-than-average transition zone under the study area, suggesting thermal perturbations of the transition zone due to deep mantle upwellings under the western shield and/or Jordan are unlikely.",

            "abstract": "Coccolithophores are a main phytoplankton group and among the most important pelagic calcifying organisms playing a key role in the ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem, as primary producers and calcifiers. Reconstruction of coccolithophores productivity is critical for understanding past climate change and defining past levels of atmospheric CO2. Upwelling systems, such as the one along the Iberian margin, are important carbon sinks. Using the coccolith Sr/Ca ratio, a recent geochemistry-based proxy, we reconstructed coccolithophores productivity changes during MIS 12 to 11 at IODP Sites U1385 and U1391, the latter closer to shore and under stronger upwelling influence. The MIS 12 is considered the most extreme glacial of the last 1 Myr and MIS 11 one of the longer lasting interglacial periods. Studying these two climatic extremes will allow a better constraining of the influence of upwelling on the coccolithophores community and understand their role in phytoplankton ecology and the carbon cycle. For a clear assessment the coccolith Sr/Ca data needs to be corrected for temperature and species composition changes and the extraction of these secondary influences were made using UK37 - SST and the coccolith community.\nResults for the Iberian margin showed higher coccolithophores productivity during the glacial period, and lower during the interglacial with an increasing trend during the glaciation and a steep decline during the deglaciation. Higher productivity during colder conditions might be associated to stronger winds that increased upwelling and/or the mixing of the upper water column and thus nutrient replenishment at the surface. These results will be placed into context of other proxy data from the Sites or region, e.g. TOC, total alkenones, diatom and coccolith abundances.",

            "abstract": "High-quality magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected at 167 sites onshore in Northwestern Namibia within the framework of a project (SAMPLE) to investigate processes related to the breakup of Gondwana. The entire study area extents from the Walvis Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean and crosses onshore the Kaoko Belt and the western boundary of the Kongo Craton.\nThe surface expressions of prominent faults such as the Purros Shear Zone and the Three Palm Mylonite Zone of the Kaoko Belt are expressed in 2D models as zones of high electrical conductivity. A region where the Etendeka flood basalts outcrop in the Western Kaoko Zone appears as a 10-15 km deep reaching highly resistive feature. However, dimensionality and strike direction analysis of the data exhibit 3D effects.\nThe 3D inversion models reproduce the main structures obtained by 2D modelling but the spatial coherency of structures is better resolved. The Purros Shear Zone and the Three Palm Mylonite Zone appear in the 3D inversion models as zones of high electrical conductivity striking in NW-SE direction in the middle crust. Where the Walvis Ridge intersects with the continent, an upwelling of resistive structures indicates a modification of the middle crust, which seems be caused by a deeper anomaly which is not resolved with MT. The spatial extent and possible emplacement of the highly resistive material associated with the Etendeka flood basalts is more enigmatic as only a relatively confined region at upper- to mid-crustal levels seems to be affected. Most importantly, these Cretaceous flood basalt events did not affect or alter the high conductivity structures associated with the preexisting Proterozoic shear zones. Compared with other cratonic boundaries in Southern Africa and elsewhere the transition from the Kaoko Belt into the Kongo Craton is unusual as it is associated with an area of high conductivity at upper to mid crustal levels. As MT site coverage in this region is sparse, however, this observation may be due to a local anomaly. We also present maps showing major anomalies observed in gravimetric and magnetic data and results using these data as constraints for the 3D electrical conductivity inversions.",

            "abstract": "Krishna Godavari (K.G.) basin is a passive margin basin developed along the Eastern coast of India. This basin has a polyhistoric evolution with multiple rift systems. Rift basin exploration has provided the oil and gas industry with almost one third of discovered global hydrocarbon resources. Understanding synrift sequences, their evolution, depositional styles and hydrocarbon prospectivity has become important with recent discovery of the wells, G-4-6,YS-AF and KG-8 in the K.G. offshore basin. The East Godavari subbasin is a hydrocarbon producing basin from synrift and pre-rift sediments, and hence this was selected as the study area for this research. The study has been carried out by utilizing data of around 58 wells (w1-w58) drilled in the study area 25 of which are hydrocarbon bearing with organic thickness varying from 200 m to 600 m. Age data generated by palaentology and palynology studies have been utilized for calibration of key well logs to differentiate between formations within prerift and synrift sediments. The electrologs of wells like resistivity, gamma ray, neutron, density and sonic logs have been utilized for correlation of different formations in all the drilled wells. The individual thicknesses of sand, shale and coal in the formations have been calculated and tabulated. For Golapalli formation, the isopach and isolith maps were generated which revealed that there were four depocentres with input from the north direction. Schematic geological cross sections were prepared using the well data and seismic data to understand the facies variation across the basin. The sedimentological and petrophysical analysis reports and electro log suites were referred to decipher the environment of deposition, the reservoir characteristics, and play types. The geochemical reports [w4 (Tmax)= 455-468 °C; w1 (Tmax) = 467-514 °C; w4(VRO)= 0.65-0.85; w1(VRO)= 0.83-1.13] revealed the source facies, its maturation and migration timings i.e. the petroleum systems. It was concluded these fluvial channel systems constitute the main hydrocarbon play for the Mandapeta and Gollapalli formations and these channel systems if found at a structurally advantageous positions should prove to be good hydrocarbon targets.",

            "abstract": "Following heavy rainfall on 4/1/14, a debris flow at Slip Stream (44.59 S 168.34 E) introduced >106 m3 of sediment to the Dart River valley floor in NZ Southern Alps. Runout over an existing fan dammed the Dart River causing a sudden drop in discharge downstream. This broad dam was breached quickly; however the temporary loss of conveyance impounded a 3 km lake with a volume of 6 x 106 m3 and depths that exceed 10 m. Quantifying the impact of this large sediment pulse on the Dart River is urgently needed to assess potential sedimentation downstream and will also provide an ideal vehicle to test theories of bed wave migration in large, extensively braided rivers. Recent advances in geomatics offer the opportunity to study these impacts directly through the production of high-resolution DEMs. These 3D snapshots can then be compared through time to quantify the morphodynamic response of the channel as it adjusts to the change in sediment supply. In this study we describe the methods and results of a novel survey strategy designed to capture of the complex morphology of the Dart River along a remote 40 km reach, from the upstream landslide source to its distal sediment sink in Lake Wakatipu. The scale of this system presents major logistical and methodological challenges, and hitherto would have conventionally be addressed with airborne laser scanning, bringing with it significant deployment constraints and costs. By contrast, we present sub-metre 3D reconstructions of the system (Figure 1), derived from highly redundant aerial photography shot with a non-metric camera from a helicopter survey that extended over an 80 km2 area. Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry was used to solve simultaneously camera position, pose and derive a 3D point cloud based on over 4000 images. Reconstructions were found to exhibit significant systematic error resulting from the implicit estimation of the internal camera orientation parameters, and we show how these effects can be minimized by optimizing the lens calibration before and after scene reconstruction using both external constraints and refined camera models. An analysis of DEM uncertainty, undertaken through comparison with long-range TLS data, demonstrates the potential for this low-cost survey strategy to generate models superior to conventional laser swath mapping even over large areas.",

            "abstract": "Drinking water supply on the island of Langeoog, North Sea, solely depends on groundwater from a freshwater lens. The correct estimation of the recharge rate is critical for a sustainable use of the resource. Extensive hydrogeological and geophysical studies have revealed differences in groundwater recharge by a factor of two and more between the top of the dunes and the dune valleys. The most convincing proof of these differences in recharge is based on isotope analysis (age dating) but boreholes are scarce and a direct proof of recharge is desired. For this purpose active infiltration experiments are performed and geophysically monitored. Former applications of this method in sand and loess soil gave evidence for the applicability of the geophysical observation when combined with tensiometers installed in situ at depth. These results showed firstly that in sandy soil the water reaches the groundwater table quicker than anticipated due to the water repellent characteristic of the dry sand, inhibiting the lateral spreading of the water. The studies also revealed that in loess preferential flow is initiated by ponding and that sprinkling caused very slow movement of water within the unsaturated zone and the water remained near the surface. On the island of Langeoog field experiments underlined the importance of water repellency on the dune surface, indicating that the rain water runs off superficially into the dune valleys where higher recharge is found. The active infiltration zone of the experiment covers an area of some 7m² and includes steeper parts of the dune. The infiltration will vary depending on rainfall intensity and duration, original water content and vegetation cover. What results can we reliably expect from the active experiment and what additional measurements are required to back up the findings? Results are ambiguous with regard to the quantitative assessment but the processes can be visualized by geophysical monitoring in situ.",

            "abstract": "Water vapor isotope ratios are critical in shaping the isotopic composition of paleo-proxies used to interpret past climate. Indeed, previous research suggests speleothems are sensitive to water vapor transport, and experiments currently underway are evaluating the role of Greenlandic vapor in setting the isotopic record of the ice sheet. The recent and rapid spread of commercial vapor isotopic analyzers—based on cavity-enhanced near-infrared laser absorption spectroscopy—is creating unparalleled opportunities to elucidate which climatic factors control the vapor isotopic composition globally. This presentation describes both an exciting application of this new technology and relevant limitations imposed by measurement uncertainties associated with long-term field deployments. Using three years of continuous water vapor isotope ratio observations from Hawaii’s Mauna Loa Observatory—one of the longest records of its kind—we evaluate the influence of large-scale dynamics and cloud microphysical processes in establishing the isotopic composition of water vapor during strong convective activity. Despite the fact that vapor isotope ratios tend to decrease with latitude, greater enrichment in Mauna Loa vapor is associated with a westward retraction of the jet stream, which funnels Asiatic outflow southward, while greater depletion is associated with southwesterly low-level flow. Differences in precipitation efficiency—which are verified by differences in aerosol concentration and total scattering—cause this apparent discrepancy. These results suggest local cloud and precipitation processes are more influential than airmass origin in setting the isotope ratios observed during these strong convective events. The length of the Mauna Loa record, meanwhile, presents a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term stability of biases associated with laser-based isotopic analyzers and to discuss calibration strategies best suited for monitoring programs designed to evaluate transient relationships between isotopic and climatic variability.",

CL3 core (200m long) was drilled from 1) upper part of Black Shale Member (35m thick) to 2) lower part of BIF Member (165m thick) of the Cleaverville Formation. Here, the BIF Member can be divided into three submembers; Greenish shale-siderite (50m thick), Magnetite-siderite (55m thick) and Black shale-siderite (60m) submembers. In this study, we used bulk samples and samples treated by hot hydrochloric acid in order to extract organic carbon.\nThe Black shale Member consists of black carbonaceous　matter and fine grain quartz (< 100μm). Organic carbon content (Corg) of black shale is 1.2% in average and organic carbon isotope ratio (δ13Corg) is -31.4 to -28.7‰. On the other hand, inorganic carbon isotope ratio of siderite (δ13Ccarb) was -5.2 to +12.6‰.\nIn the BIF Member, the Greenish shale-siderite submember is composed of well laminated greenish sideritic shale and white chert (<7mm thick), which is gradually increase from black shale of the Black shale Member through about 10m. Magnetite-siderite submember contains very fine magnetite lamination with inter-bedded greenish sideritic shale and siderite lamination. Hematite is identified near fractured part. The Black shale-siderite submember is composed of black shale, siderite and chert bands.\n1) Siderite layers of these three submembers showedδ13Ccarb value of -14.6 to -3.8‰. Corg and δ13Corg content are 0.2% and -18.3 to -0.3‰. 2) Siderite grains within greenish sideritic shales showedδ13Ccarb value of -12.9 to +15.0‰. 3) Black shale of Corg and δ13Corg content in the BIF Member are 0.1% and -36.3 to -17.1‰ respectively.\nWe found great difference in values of δ13Ccarb of siderite. One is Corg-rich shale (up to +15.0‰) and the other is Corg-poor siderite layers (up to -3.8‰). The lighter value of siderite layers may be originated from precursor organic carbon which is strongly affected by biological activity.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are dynamic slip events that propagate along fault surfaces, radiating seismic waves. The majority of energy released is expended in heating and breaking of rocks along the fault. The fracture damage is linked to transient stress conditions at the rupture tip which only exist during dynamic slip, while the frictional heating depends on high velocity slip behind the rupture tip to generate heat energy faster than it can be dissipated, causing transient local temperature rise. One might think that extensive damage and alteration would result, creating an unambiguous geological fingerprint, but in fact, there are few unequivocal indicators for past seismic slip. In 1999, the rare fault rock pseudotachylyte (melt formed when frictional heating exceeds the solidus) was the only accepted evidence (Cowan, 1999). Recently, more indicators of fossilized earthquakes have been proposed.\nWe define “evidence of past earthquakes” as evidence of either fast fault slip (at rates that only occur during earthquakes) or evidence of the propagation of dynamic rupture. We first summarize advances made in identifying evidence in the rock record of fast slip. Much of the work during the past 15 years has focused on integrating carefully controlled laboratory friction experiments, and constraints from numerical modeling, with field observations in an attempt to re-create structures observed in fault rocks and then relate these to the specific boundary conditions required to form them in the laboratory. This approach has yielded a number of advances in identifying textures and geochemical signatures diagnostic of fast slip via temperature rises which may not reach the bulk melting temperature of the fault rocks. Next, we focus on damage near the tip of shear ruptures propagating at velocities characteristic of earthquakes, an approach which has received less attention in the geological literature than fast slip but is equally diagnostic. Finally, we try to frame some of the remaining challenges in this field. These challenges include future work on diagnostic features of earthquake deformation along faults, but also a more philosophical discussion of what an earthquake actually is.",

            "abstract": "Fault systems within incipient rifts that cut basaltic rocks comprise an array of fine-scale structures, including networks of fractures and small displacement (<15 m) faults that accommodate regional extension. These zones of damaged rock have mechanical and physical properties distinct from the surrounding intact host rock. As the rift system evolves this early-formed damage can be reactivated, and influence the distribution and growth of new fractures. Constraining the role of this inter-fault deformation in rift zone development is therefore important to characterizing the regional distribution of extensional strains, and the evolving physical and fluid flow properties of the host rock. Here we use high resolution field and remote mapping of the Koa’e insipient rift fault system on the south flank of Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island, and the Krafla rift system, Iceland, to investigate the evolution of segmented rift fault systems in layered basalts, formed at low confining pressures. Extension in the Koa’e system is accommodated dominantly by interaction of zones of opening-mode fractures and areas of surface flexure rather than surface-breaching normal faults, which is attributed to gravitational collapse of Kilauea. Extension in the Krafla system is localised on segmented, large displacement (>20 m) normal faults, the development of which may have been controlled by dyke emplacement. Preliminary comparison between the Koa’e and Krafla systems suggests that strain rate and/or the effective stress path plays a primary role in controlling the geometry, characteristics, and distribution of major faults, and the scale and distribution of secondary (oblique) brittle structures within rift zones.",

            "abstract": "Information on the amplification characteristics of the near-surface formations in a regional sense is essential to adequately represent both seismic hazard maps and ground shaking maps. Due to the scarceness of shear-wave velocity data in most regions, several methods have been proposed in order to obtain first order representations of Vs30. These include the surface geology method and the topographic slope method. The latter method has become the standard way for incorporating site effects into regional studies worldwide given the convenience provided by the global Vs30 Internet server.\nIn the framework of project SCENE we developed a shear wave velocity database for Portugal. The database consists of 87 shear-wave velocity depth profiles from a variety of lithological and geological formations. We used an iterative three-step procedure to develop the Vs30 based site-condition map: 1) to define a preliminary set of geologically defined units based on the literature; 2) to calculate the distribution of Vs30 for each unit; and 3) to perform statistical tests in order to estimate the significance of the difference in the Vs30 distribution characteristics between the units. The units were merged according to the results of the statistical tests and the procedure was repeated. We started by classifying the sites into six generalized geological units. The final set consists of three units only: F1 (igneous, metamorphic and old sedimentary rocks); F2 (Neogene and Pleistocene formations); and F3 (Holocene deposits).\nWe used the database to evaluate the performance of Vs30 proxies. The use of proxies based either on geological units or on correlations with the topographic slope shows relatively unbiased total residual distributions of the logarithm of Vs30. However, the performance of the methods varies significantly with the generalized geological unit analyzed. Both methods are biased towards lower values of Vs30 for rock formations. The topographic-slope method is biased towards higher values of Vs30 for Holocene formations. Our results reinforce those published for SCR in Europe using a sparser database: Vs30 is poorly correlated with topographic slope. We conclude that in the absence of endogenous data the method based on analogue surface geology units should be preferred to that based on topographic slope.",

            "abstract": "Recent progress in experimental stratigraphy of river deltas has brought an implication that basin water depth seriously affects not only delta progradation, but also distributary channel behavior and alluvial aggradation of the delta plain. A series of experiments conducted with differential basement suggests that a prograding delta can retain its isotropic shoreline configuration even though there is significant variation in basin water depth in the transverse direction, and thus that local basin water depth affects local residence time and avulsion frequency of distributary channels. With deeper basin water, a delta progrades slowly, distributary channels migrate slowly and avulse less frequently, and the feeder alluvial system aggrades slowly. Another series of experiments, which were conducted to produce a 2D graded alluvial channel, reveals that a delta facing a very deep water basin does not prograde, its distributary channels do not migrate, and the feeder alluvial system does not aggrade at all (i.e. the state of grade). These experimental facts imply a synthetic understanding of delta progradation, distributary channel stability and alluvial aggradation, in terms of the control of basin water depth. This novel understanding can be expressed in part by a simple geometrical model. Dimensionless rates of (1) delta progradation, (2) channel migration and (3) alluvial aggradation are expressed with an identical numerical formula that can be specified only with dimensionless basin water depth and alluvial slope normalized with the delta’s foreset slope. Values of those dimensionless rates, ranging between 0 and 1, denote how close the feeder alluvial system is to grade: 0 for grade and 1 for perfect aggradation. The three dimensionless rates, or grade index, are also applicable to a river delta growing with sea level change, as far as it retains an isotropic shoreline configuration.",

            "abstract": "The San Gabriel Mountains (SGM) in Southern California, rate amongst the most rapidly uplifting and eroding mountains in the United States. Their steep slopes and sensitivity to wildfires, flash floods, landslides, and debris flows account for imminent hazards to nearby urban areas that might be accentuated by climatic and other environmental changes. Previous studies suggested that river terraces along the North Fork of the San Gabriel River, record temporal variations in sediment supply and river transport capacity that are representative for the SGM and related to climatic changes during the Quaternary.\nBased on field observations, digital topographic analysis, and dating of Quaternary deposits, we suggest that valley aggradation in the North Fork San Gabriel Canyon was spatially confined and a consequence of the sudden supply of unconsolidated material to upstream reaches by one of the largest known landslides in the SGM. New 10Be-derived surface exposure ages from the landslide deposits, previously assumed to be early to middle Pleistocene in age, indicate at least three Holocene events at ~8-9 ka, ~4-5 ka, and ~0.5-1 ka. The oldest landslide predates the valley aggradation period, which is constrained by existing 14C ages and new luminescence ages to ~7-8 ka. The spatial distribution, morphology, and sedimentology of the river terraces are consistent with deposition from far-travelling debris flows that originated within the landslide deposits. Valley aggradation in the North Fork San Gabriel Canyon therefore resulted from locally enhanced sediment supply that temporarily overwhelmed river capacity but the lack of similar deposits in other parts of the SGM argues against a regional climatic signal. So far, there exists no evidence that in the San Gabriel Mountains, climatic changes can cause sustained increases in hillslope sediment supply that lead to river aggradation and terrace formation.",

            "abstract": "Little has challenged our understanding of climate change more so than the abruptness with which large-scale shifts in temperature occurred during the last glacial period. Atmospheric temperature jumps occurring within decades over Greenland were closely matched by rapid changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and major re-organisation of the deep ocean circulation. Although these climatic instabilities are well-documented in various proxy records, the causal mechanisms of such short-lived oscillations remain poorly understood, largely due to the dating uncertainties that prevent the integration of different archives. Synchronisation of palaeoclimate records on a common timescale is inherently problematic, and unravelling the lead/lag responses (hence cause and effect) between the Earth’s climate components is currently beyond our reach. TRACE - a 5 year project funded by the European Research Council - exploits the use of microscopic traces of tephra deposits to precisely correlate the Greenland ice-cores with North Atlantic marine records. Here we draw upon examples of how these time-lines can be used to constrain the lead/lag responses between the atmospheric and oceanic systems during the last glacial period. High-resolution proxy data from North Atlantic marine cores MD04-2829CQ from the Rosemary Bank and MD04 2820CQ from the Goban Spur are integrated with the Greenland ice-cores according to the position of common tephra isochrons. These direct tie-lines allow us to focus in detail on the relative timing of rapid warming transitions between Greenland and the North Atlantic ocean during the last glacial period.",

            "abstract": "Water is one of the most vital natural resource and its availability and quality determine ecosystem productivity, both for agricultural and natural systems. Una district is one of the major potential agricultural districts in Himachal Pradesh, India. More than 70% of the population of this district is engaged in agriculture and allied sectors and major crops grown are maize, wheat, rice, sugarcane, pulses and vegetables. The region faces drought every year and about 90 per cent of the area is water stressed. This has resulted in crop loss and shortage of food and fodder. The sources of drinking water, small ponds and bowlies dry-up during summer season resulting in scarcity of drinking water. Una district receives rainfall during monsoons from June to September and also during non-monsoon period (winter). The annual average rainfall in the area is about 1040 mm with 55 average rainy days. But due to heavy surface run-off the farmers not able to cultivate the crops more than once in a year. Past research indicate that the geomorphology of the Una district might be responsible for such droughts as it controls the surface as well as ground water resources. The research proposes to develop a water stress model for Una district using the geomorphic parameters, water resource and land use land cover data of the study area. Using Survey of India topographical maps (1:50000), the geomorphic parameters are extracted. The spatial layers of these parameters i.e. drainage density, slope, relative relief, ruggedness index, surface water body’s frequency are created in GIS. A time series of normalized remotely sensed data of the study area is used for land use land cover classification and analyses. Based on the results from the water stress model, the drought/water stress areas and water harvesting zones are identified and documented. The results of this research will help the general population in resolving the drinking water problem to a certain extent and also the cultivators to water the crops more than twice per year which might increase the crop yield in Una district.",

            "abstract": "Climate-induced heat waves have been increasing globally in the past 5-10 years and are projected to continue increasing throughout the 21st century. In urban areas, heat waves are exacerbated by the non-climate stressor of urban heat islands (UHIs). The vulnerability of a city’s population to heat waves reflects exposure to extreme heat events, sensitivity of the population to impacts, such as adverse health effects, and adaptive capacity to prepare for and respond to heat waves. Socially and economically vulnerable populations are especially at risk to the impacts of heat waves, due to increasing energy costs, air pollution, and heat-related illness and mortality. NASA earth science datasets, combined with socioeconomic data, can be used to create indicators that characterize vulnerability to urban heat events and address the effectiveness of adaptation measures designed to reduce local temperatures. The indicator development process should include engagement from local stakeholders and end users from the onset to ensure local relevance and, ultimately, indicator uptake and sustainability. This presentation will explore the process of working with urban stakeholders in Philadelphia to develop a set of policy-relevant, interdisciplinary vulnerability indicators focused on extreme heat events in urban areas. Ambient and land surface temperature, land cover classifications, NDVI, and US Census data are used to create a basket of indicators that reflect urban heat wave duration and intensity, UHI exposure, socioeconomic vulnerability, and adaptation effectiveness. These indicators can be assessed at the city level and also comparatively among different parts of a city to help quantify and track heat wave impacts on vulnerable populations and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.",

Unspiked K-Ar dating method (peak comparison method) enables mass fractionation correction of initial Ar ratio, and this method has been applied successfully to young lavas, especially younger than 0.5 Ma, with high atmospheric contamination. Zao volcano is the first volcano that is demonstrated the reliability of the mass fraction corrected ages by Takaoka et al. (1989). They reported 30 ages for central Zao volcano, and However, not all units are covered and some data contradict the stratigraphy probably because of low-K and/or excess Ar contamination.\nBased on new geological and geochrolonogical study, the volcanic activity can be divided into six stages. Stage I: subaqueous eruptions of low-K tholleiitic basaltic to andesitic magmas occured in central part at around 1 Ma. Stage II: andesitic northwestern edifice was formed at ca. 0.5 Ma. Stage III: several small to meddle sized andesitic to deictic edifices were formed at western part during ca. 0.35-0.25 Ma. Stage IV: andesitic to dacitic lavas swelled out from central summit area and the main edifice was formed during ca. 0.25-0.20 Ma. Stage V: andesitic lava flows with pyroclastic materials erupted from several vents during ca. 0.13-0.04 Ma. Several lava flows younger than 0.05 Ma were first dated on this study. Stage VI: The most recent stage of Zao volcano began at ca. 35 ka, when the horseshoe-shaped Umanose calderawas formed.",

Taiwan Executive Yuan is conducting a six-year (2014~2019) program “Integrated River Basin Management Plan” applying LID to build sponge cities. Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior is editing the manual of LID technology for Taiwan. However, since the hydrological environments, physiographic conditions, climates, the strength and frequency of disasters in Taiwan are different from that in America, this study takes the first laboratory experiment and model simulation to evaluate the efficiency of application of LID in Taiwan.\nLID Facilities includes porous pavement, rain garden, green roof, tree box filter facilities and so on, and in this study, porous pavement is taken as an example for discussion. In the part of laboratory experiments, the sand box experiments is designed to operate with the specified rainfall return period calculated by Horton formula and rainfall characteristics of Taipei. Then the outflow hydrograph in each designed rainfall of specified return period can be evaluated. As for model simulation, this study constructs LID simulation elements by SWMM model and tests the suitability for simulation of the outflow hydrograph obtained from experiments, and definitely quantifies the efficiency of water retention and flood reduction of porous pavement. The results fits well with the experimental observation data with less than 10% error of pick flow. It suggests that, with LID simulation elements constructed in this study, the efficiency of LID in actual on-site application can be evaluated.\nThe results shows that porous pavement is able to delay arrival time of pick about 5% ~10% and reduce the pick flow about 5%~20%, and hold the ability of near 3~5% water retention. It proves that application of LID can retain water and reduce flood in Taiwan.",

Desert Island. As the Northeast Creek watershed was the site of previous water quality studies, this program of courses enabled continued monitoring of portions of the watershed. The program includes 4 new courses: Critical Zone 1, Critical Zone 2, Wildlife Biology, and Botany. In Critical Zone 1 students are introduced to general topics in Earth Science and learn to use ArcGIS to make basic maps. In Critical Zone 2, Wildlife Biology, and Botany, students are in the field every week using classic field tools and methods. All three of these courses use the same three general field areas: two with working farms at the middle and lower portion of the watershed and one uninhabited forested property in the higher relief headwaters of the watershed. Students collect daily surface water chemistry data at five stream sites within the watershed, complete basic geologic bedrock and geomorphic mapping, conduct wildlife surveys, botanical surveys, and monitor weather patterns at each of the main sites. Beyond the class data collected and synthesized, students also complete group independent study projects at focused field sites, some of which have turned into much larger research projects. This program is an opportunity for students and faculty with varied interests and expertise to work together to study a specific field locality over multiple years. We see this model as enhancing a number of positive education components: field-based learning, teamwork, problem solving, interdisciplinary discussion, multiple faculty interaction, student mentoring, and original research. In the future we see the possibility of welcoming even more interdisciplinary work including rigorous studies spanning the arts and humanities.",

Although the influence of channel morphology on bed particle dispersion has been widely recognized in the literature for decades, there continues to be limited understanding of the mechanics of this process. In order to closely examine the influence of morphology on particle travel dispersion, long-term displacement data was collected from 1,400 tracer particles since 2004 in East Creek – a small channel with both riffle-pool and rapid morphologies. A set of flume experiments was devised to complement the field data in a controlled environment. Herein, particles were traced through a scale model of the field site using two tracing techniques in both plane bed, as well as riffle-pool bed morphologies and under varying flow conditions. Field data shows that channel morphology influences both particle travel distance and vertical mixing. Furthermore, detailed mapping of the channel bed displays a localized spatial pattern of particle mobility that reflects changes in both channel morphology and particle composition. The flume experiments allowed for the exploration of the conditions and timing under which a shift in the travel distance distribution occurs from a stochastic distribution (a Gamma distribution), to a distribution controlled by the local bed morphology.",

            "abstract": "The heat budget of a lake is a fundamental component of physical limnology, and is strongly dependent on the surface heat flux. However, the surface energy exchange depends on several factors, making it difficult to estimate. In this study we employed several bulk formulas to estimate Lake Geneva’s surface heat flux. Combination of different surface heat flux terms leads to a surface heat exchange model which requires various data. Different data sources were used in the heat flux estimates. Meteorological data were taken from an operational numerical weather prediction model, namely COSMO-2 (run by the Swiss meteorological service), while satellite imagery was used for the lake surface water temperature (LSWT). In order to find the best combination of the bulk formulas and to calibrate the model, the temporal evolution of the heat budget was estimated using long-term time series of vertical temperature profiles. Vertical temperature profiles at two points (one in the Lake Geneva’s large basin and one in its small basin) were used. A sensitivity analysis was performed to find the key parameters, and more significantly the optimal combination of different heat flux terms. Finally, the spatio-temporal surface heat flux variation was calculated according to the proposed model. In addition, the relationship between variability of the surface heat flux and meteorological forcing was assessed. The different models, which are of differing complexity, gave reasonably consistent results, with differences attributed to simplifications inherent in them. The modeling results revealed that the LSWT and wind forcing are dominant factors underlying Lake Geneva surface heat flux spatial variation, while its temporal variability is mainly due to the global radiation and air temperature changes. In conclusion, the bulk heat balance approach is a useful tool to estimate various heat flux terms as well as their monthly or seasonally contributions. But, in large lakes where the LSWT is highly variable, the variable surface heat flux would be unavoidable.",

            "abstract": "The economy and environment of the Hertfordshire and North London Area (H&NL Area) within Thames River Basin rely on the limited water resources in the region, especially groundwater. The water resources in the area are managed, amongst other mechanisms, through water abstraction licences and discharge permits. Current management practice is not responsive or flexible enough to address future pressures. To support improving current water management in the area, a Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) study was conducted.\nThis is a pioneering work in the field of WFA applied in a regulatory context. The study deals with a high level of complexity in a number of aspects: 1) high spatial and temporal resolution (sub-catchment level and monthly time scale); 2) multiple water use sectors (industry, domestic and agriculture); 3) different sources of water for human use (surface and groundwater); 4) different types of human pressure on water resources (consumption and pollution); 5) integrated assessment of water use sustainability (water scarcity and water pollution level); and 6) projected water footprint (WF) with water demand and climate change scenarios.\nThe green, blue and grey WF on surface water, the blue and grey WF on groundwater of the 35 sub-catchments within the H&NL Area have been estimated for the domestic, industrial and agricultural sectors on a monthly basis. Blue water scarcity (BWS) and water pollution level (WPL) were evaluated to assess the sustainability of the blue and grey WF respectively, distinguishing between ground and surface water. A “wet” and “dry” climate change scenario for 2060 was used to project the WF components and BWS. This study identifies sub-catchments in the area facing moderate to severe BWS and/or WPLs and illustrates the relation between the two.\nThe results demonstrate that WFA and in particular BWS and WPLs can and should form a basis for regulatory reform for water resources management. Levels of BWS in sub-catchments can inform decisions on issuing and putting conditions on water abstraction licenses. Data on sub-catchment grey WF and WPLs can help review of the current effluent discharge consenting scheme. Abstraction licensing should be linked to effluent discharge consenting. The study proposes an approach to this regulatory reform based on the BWS and WPLs within the area.",

            "abstract": "During the last decades an increase of debris flow catastrophic events has been recorded along the Italian territory, mainly due to the increment of settlements and human activities in mountain areas. Considering the large extent of debris flow prone areas, non structural protection strategies should be preferably implemented because of economic constrains associated with structural mitigation measures. In such a framework hazard assessment methodologies play a key role representing useful tools for the development of emergency management policies.\nThe aim of the present study is to apply an integrated debris flow hazard assessment methodology, where rainfall probabilistic analysis and physically-based landslide triggering and propagation models are combined. In particular, the probabilistic rainfall analysis provides the forcing scenarios of different return periods, which are then used as input to a model based on combination of the USGS TRIGRS and the FLO-2D codes. The TRIGRS model (Baum et al., 2008; 2010), developed for analyzing shallow landslide triggering is based on an analytical solution of linearized forms of the Richards’ infiltration equation and an infinite-slope stability calculation to estimate the timing and locations of slope failures, while the FLO-2D (O'Brien 1986) is a two-dimensional finite difference model that simulates debris flow propagation following a mono-phase approach, based on empirical quadratic rheological relation developed by O'Brien and Julien (1985). Various aspects of the combination of the models are analyzed, giving a particular focus on the possible variations of triggered amounts compatible with a given return period.\nThe methodology is applied to the case study area of the Messina Province in Italy, which has been recently struck by severe events, as the one of the 1st October 2009 which hit the Giampilieri Village causing 37 fatalities. Results are analyzed to assess the potential hazard that may affect the densely urbanized areas and the transportation infrastructures which are present in this Province, demonstrating the usefulness of the modeling approach.",

Our goals are: i) to understand the instrument and the environmental conditions that control the observed seismic noise; and ii) to obtain reliable broadband surface wave dispersion measurements.\nThe noise sources are investigated through the probability density functions (PDFs) of power spectral density (PSDs), which provides insights on the generation and propagating of seismic noise in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nWe show the results of the Rayleigh wave group velocity tomography performed using ambient seismic noise observed on the 24 broadband OBS and on 7 broadband land stations located in the south of Portugal.\nThe time-series, for the 11 months, were cross-correlated to obtain the empirical Green's functions between all vertical sensors pairs, namely the OBS-vertical, the OBS-hydrophone and the vertical component of the land seismic stations. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the individual cross-correlograms were summed using a time-frequency domain phase weighted stack.\nThe stacked cross-correlograms enabled us to compute short-period surface-wave group-velocity measurements for all the interstation paths. We used these measurements to construct maps of Rayleigh-wave group-velocity lateral perturbations, at different periods.\nDespite the great difference in the crustal structure below the OBS (thin continental or oceanic type) and the land stations (typical continental crust, 30 km thick) we were able to derive high S/N cross-correlations between these different types of sensors.\nThis study was co-sponsored by several projects namely the QuakeLoc-PT (PTDC/GEO-FIQ/3522/2012), AQUAREL (PTDC/CTE-GIX/116819/2010), NEAREST FP6-2005-GLOBAL-4 (OJ 2005 C177/15), WILAS (PTDC/CTE-GIX/097946/2008), and PEST-OE/CTE/LA-0019/2013-2014.",

            "abstract": "Tropical Cyclones (TCs) lead to potentially severe coastal flooding through wind surge and also through rainfall-runoff processes. There is growing interest in modeling these processes simultaneously. Here, a statistical approach that can facilitate this process is presented with an application to the Hudson River Basin that is associated with the New York City metropolitan area.\nThree submodels are used in sequence. The first submodel is a stochastic model of the complete life cycle of North Atlantic (NA) tropical cyclones developed by Hall and Yonekura (2011). It uses archived data of TCs throughout the North Atlantic to estimate landfall rates at high geographic resolution as a function of the ENSO state and of sea surface temperature (SST).\nThe second submodel translates the attributes of a tropical cyclone simulated by the first model to the streamflows at specific points of the tributaries of the Hudson River. That points are the closure sections of five different watersheds. Two different approaches are used and compared: 1) an ANN-cyclone/rainfall clustering model which calculates the rainfall intensity at selected stations within the watershed, that are then used as inputs of an ANN rainfall/runoff model; 2) an ANN/ Bayesian multivariate approach that translates the TC attributes ( track, SST, Velocities,..) directly in streamflows in the tributaries.\nFinally, the streamflows of the tributaries of the Hudson River are to be used as inputs in a hydrodynamic model that includes storm surge dynamics for the simulation of coastal flooding along the Hudson River. Calibration and validation of the model is carried out by using, selected tropical cyclone data since 1950, and hourly and daily station rainfall and streamflow recorded for such extreme events. Seven stream gauges (Croton River, Rondout Creek, Wappinger Creek, Troy dam, Mohawk River at Cohoes, Mohawk River diversion at Crescent Dam, Hudson River above lock one nr Waterford) and over 20 rain gauges are used. The performance of the proposed model as tool for storm events is then analyzed and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic deep ocean circulation in the Latest Cretaceous (75-66 Ma) was dominated by regional processes, as indicated by the presence of distinct deep water masses. Due to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, its different sub-basins became progressively connected and a global mode of ocean circulation commenced in the early Paleogene, ~60 Ma. To understand the evolution of deep water formation and exchange, Nd-isotope data and δ13C stratigraphies are generated for a range of sites in the North and South Atlantic. These permit to identify different intermediate and deep-water masses, to recognize their potential source regions and to determine the exact timing of deep water connection.\nThe carbonate-rich pelagic sediments of Site U1403 near Newfoundland can be astronomically tuned and correlated to the global δ13C framework.\nRelatively negative seawater εNd(t) signatures in the 67-62 Ma interval at Site U1403 of ~-10 are distinct from those recorded further south in the North Atlantic. Possible explanations could include elevated non-radiogenic weathering inputs from the North American craton.\nIn the latest Maastrichtian, the Site U1403 εNd(t) record displays a short-term positive excursion before the K/Pg boundary (67-66 Ma) followed by a sudden drop to unradiogenic values at the boundary. Changes in ocean circulation might be related to climatic changes in the pre-extinction interval and the impact itself.\nThe εNd(t) records at Sites 1267 and 525 at Walvis Ridge show that an early Maastrichtian excursion to highly radiogenic values reflects a brief interval at 72-70 Ma, related to a period of increased hot-spot volcanism. Concomitant measurements of εNd(t) values in three different archives, fish teeth, ferromanganese coatings of bulk sediments and of foraminifera, provide a test for the partial influence of detrital particles on the isotopic composition of coatings.\nThe first data of Sites U1403, 1267 and 525 indicate the occurrence of a common deep-water neodymium isotope signature (εNd(t) -8) in the North and South Atlantic since 60 Ma. At this time, the sub-basins of the deep Atlantic became fully connected. A deep-water mass with a common εNd(t) signature, likely originating in the high southern latitudes, prevailed over a broad range of water depths, indicating vigorous deep ocean circulation.",

            "abstract": "The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is known as the period when ice volume reached its maximum and global temperature was lower than that of today. Accurate record of ice volume change requires relative sea-level reconstruction. Yokoyama et al. (2000) reported that the LGM terminated abruptly at 19 ka with a rapid rise (19 ka Event) using marine sediment cores from Bonaparte Gulf, Northwestern Australia. Although their reconstruction of the duration and magnitude of sea-level minima was confirmed to be reliable (cf. De Deckker and Yokoyama, 2009), relatively weaker evidence was presented for sea level during the time into the LGM. Partly because the number of their radiocarbon dates is insufficient to constrain the duration of LGM, thus further dating on sediment cores obtained from the key water depth (ca. 120m) is desired. Here we present the relative sea level record from Bonaparte Gulf using high-resolution radiocarbon dating. The result indicates that the duration of LGM is shorter than that from previous studies (cf, Yokoyama et al., 2000, Mix et al., 2001, Clark et al., 2009). Bonaparte Gulf is a far-field site located in a tectonically stable region. Consequently, this area is considered to be suitable for reconstructing accurate records of ice volume change. Using a marine sediment core (water depth: 120 m, length: 583 cm) taken from this region, we found the timing of LGM by reconstructing relative sea-level records. High-resolution radiocarbon dating of 23 shell samples and 26 bulk sediments is conducted to determine the precise relative sea-level records. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as stable carbon isotope from bulk sediments are also employed for the paleo-environmental reconstruction caused by sea level change. Our result shows that the contributions from terrestrial organic matters were higher during the LGM than that for a sea-level highstand. This indicates that a sea-level lowstand occurred at ca. 21 ka and that ice volume in the high latitude continent could have changed rapidly during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "Quartz is the most abundant mineral in the Earth’s crust and is found in virtually every geological context. Despite its ubiquity and the detailed studies on the conditions of quartz crystallization, some questions concerning its growth and sector zoning with regard to trace element incorporation and oxygen isotope fractionations and the implications thereof for interpretations on the conditions of formation remain (e.g., Jourdan et al., 2009). This study presents new in-situ measurements of trace element and oxygen isotope ratios on natural hydrothermal quartz from an extensional gold-bearing quartz vein in the western Swiss Alps. The temperature of formation of the veins is estimated by quartz-hematite oxygen isotope thermometry to be about 360°C. A detailed SEM-CL study of this sample shows cyclic lamellar growth, alternating with phases of dissolution that are directly followed by macro-mosaic growth of the quartz, before returning to a cyclic lamellar growth again.\nTrace element concentrations (measured for Na, K, Li, Al, and Ti) notably showed Al/Si variations of three orders of magnitude and coupled Al and Li variations, likely substituting for Si in different growth zones with lower values in macro-mosaic zones precipitating after the period of dissolution. The oxygen isotope composition of the crystal, in contrast, is homogeneous through all growth zones (δ18O values between 15.6‰ and 16.2‰) indicating that the fluid must have been buffered by the host-rock and/or the source of the fluid remained the same despite the period of quartz dissolution. Furthermore, the temperature during crystallization of the quartz crystal has likely also remained similar. The fact that no variations are measured in oxygen isotope compositions but some variations in trace element contents may suggest that changes in pressure were important during the formation of this quartz crystal. Give the pressure effects on the solubility of quartz (Fournier and Potter, 1982), both the cyclic character of quartz growth and perhaps also the changes in Al/Si may be related to pressure variations caused by seismic activity during retrograde Alpine metamorphism.\nA-L.

            "abstract": "The lowermost 300 km of mantle (D'') acts as the lower boundary layer to mantle convection. Numerous observations find that this layer is anisotropic, unlike the bulk of the lower mantle above, which is isotropic. The causal mechanism for this anisotropy remains elusive, though its organisation is likely to be imposed by deformation associated with mantle convection. The subduction of the Tethys ocean (since 180 Ma) is predicted to have deposited slab material in D'' in circum-Pacific regions, making these regions cold, encouraging the phase transformation in the MgSiO3 polymorph bridgmanite to a post-perovskite (ppv) structure. These regions are probably rich in ppv.\nHere we present new observations of anisotropy from shear wave splitting of ScS phases recorded in the epicentral distance range 50-85 degrees. These observations are corrected for anisotropy in the upper mantle beneath source and receiver. Due to the layout of events and receivers we primarily sample D'' beneath the landward side of the circum-Pacific. A detailed pattern of anisotropy is revealed. Anisotropy predominantly leads to SH fast wave propagation with an inferred average strength of 0.9%. This is consistent with many previous observations. However, we do not limit our observations to the SH/SV system. Many observations show non SH/SV fast polarisation. We interpret these data for tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) style anisotropy. We resolve non-radial anisotropy at unprecedented global scale, in turn placing new constraints on the D'' flow field.\nWe test the ability of the flow model TX2008 (Simmons et al., 2009) to fit our observations. This is achieved by modelling the development of a lattice preferred orientation texture of a ppv layer subject to this flow field using a visco-plastic self consistent theory (Walker et al., 2011). Due to uncertainty in the slip system of ppv three candidate glide planes are trialled: (100)/{110}, (010), and (001). The seismic anisotropy of these models is probed using the full wave field simulation code SPECFEM3D_GLOBE (Tromp et al., 2008). Using these synthetic seismograms we assess the ability of flow model TX2008 (assuming a ppv D'') to explain our observations, and determine which slip system fits the data best.",

This orbit provides more comprehensive coverage of the tropics and mid-latitudes than sun-synchronous orbiting sensors, with nearly a three day repeat cycle. Thus, science applications of CATS include cloud and aerosol climate studies, air quality monitoring, and smoke/volcanic plume tracking.\nCurrent uncertainties in cloud and aerosol properties limit our ability to accurately model the Earth’s climate system and predict climate change. These limitations are due primarily to difficulties in adequately measuring aerosols and clouds on a global scale. A primary science objectives of CATS is to provide global aerosol and cloud vertical profile data in near real time to for assimilation in aerosol transport models such as the NASA GEOS-5 model. Furthermore, the vertical profiles of cloud and aerosol properties provided by CATS will complement current and future passive satellite sensors.\nAnother important science objective of CATS is to advance technology in support of future mission development. CATS will employ 355 nm and HSRL capabilities, as well as depolarization at multiple wavelengths. These expanded measurement capabilities will provide the science community with new and improved global data products that have yet to be retrieved from space-based lidar. In preparation for launch, simulations of the CATS lidar signal are produced using GEOS5 model data to develop and test future data products. An example of the simulated CATS attenuated total backscatter for the 532 nm parallel channel is shown in Figure 2 using the GEOS-5 model forecast from 15 July 2009. This work provides an overview of the CATS mission, science objectives and simulated data.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for recent climate-wildfire linkages underscores the need for better understanding of relationships between wildfire and major climate shifts in Earth history, which in turn offers the potential for prognoses for wildfire and human adaptations to it. In particular, what are the links between seasonality and wildfire frequency and severity, and what are the feedbacks between wildfire, landscape evolution, and biogeochemical cycles, particularly the carbon and iron cycles? A key first step in addressing these questions is recovering well-described wildfire records from a variety of paleolandscapes and paleoclimate regimes. Although charcoal and organic biomarkers are commonly used indicators of fire, taphonomic processes and time-consuming analytical preparations often preclude their routine use in some environments and in high-stratigraphic resolution paleowildfire surveying. The phenomenological relationship between fire and magnetic susceptibility can make it a useful surveying tool, but increased magnetic susceptibility in sediments is not unique to fire, and thus limits its diagnostic power. Here we utilize component-specific rock magnetic methods and analytical techniques to identify the rock magnetic fingerprint of wildfire. We use a custom-designed air furnace, a series of iron-free laboratory soils, natural saprolites and soils, and fuels from Arizona Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands to simulate wildfire in a controlled and monitored environment. Soil-ash residues and soil and fuel controls were then characterized using First Order Reversal Curve (FORC) patterns, DC backfield IRM coercivity spectra, low-temperature SIRM demagnetization behavior, and low-temperature cycling of room-temperature SIRM behavior. We will complement these magnetic analyses with high-resolution TEM of magnetic extracts. Here we summarize the systematic changes to sediment magnetism as pyrolitized organic matter is incorporated into artificial and natural soils. These observations help us elucidate the processes and sources responsible for increases in magnetic susceptibility observed in natural burned soils, as well as identify a unique rock magnetic fingerprint for natural wildfire that has the potential to be preserved in sedimentary sequences in the geological record.",

            "abstract": "The rapid deposition of volcanogenic sediments, highly susceptible to alteration by seawater has led to distinct pore water geochemical profiles throughout the sedimentary basins of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc. Drilling at Site U1438, in the Amami-Sankaku Basin, recovered a 1300 m thick volcaniclastic section overlain by a 160 m thick section of sediments largely devoid of volcanic input. At Site U1438, 67 porewater samples were analyzed onboard for salinity, pH, oxidation-reduction potential and major and trace element concentrations. Here we focus on the depth profiles of elements which were also analyzed at Sites U1201, 792 and 793. Chloride and Bromide concentrations display similar trends; near constant in the upper 160 m and a linear downward increase to maximum concentrations from 600 mbsf onwards. This increase is likely caused by uptake of water by secondary minerals, resulting in chloride and bromide enrichment in the porewater. Calcium and magnesium porewater concentrations display opposite trends in the upper 440 m; the first increases from 11.5 to 140 mM, and the latter decreases from 53 mM until its depletion in the porewater. Leaching of Ca from the glass-rich sediments and underlying igneous basement are potential sources for Ca in the porewater, while Mg, Na and K presumably replace Ca through cation-exchange. Compared to Site U1438, similar trends of major elements concentration in the pore water were observed at the nearby Sites U1201 (serpentine mud volcano in the forearc of the Mariana subduction system), 792 and 793 (both in the Izu-Bonin forearc sedimentary basin). However, differences in depositional rates, thickness and age of the sedimentary basins, geothermal gradients and the influence of serpentine mud flows, have led to distinct pore water geochemical profiles.",

            "abstract": "On geologic time scales concentrations of atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas and critical mediator of Earth’s surface temperature and climate, is thought to be controlled by a balance between CO2 input from mantle degassing through volcanism and metamorphism and consumption via temperature-sensitive chemical weathering of tectonically uplifted continental rocks. This interplay between global climate and tectonic uplift also controls the delivery of cations to the oceans. Hence, past changes in seawater chemistry provide a powerful archive of the interplay and feedback between climate and tectonics. Mass Extinction Events, like that at K-Pg boundary, are characterized by rapid, global Carbon Cycle Perturbations either from increased mantle degassing or by incineration of the continents due to extra-terrestrial impact. It is hypothesized that enhanced chemical weathering of continental silicate rocks consumes this excess CO2 and restores steady-state.\nLithium, B, and Mg are conservative ions in seawater that are isotopically homogeneous with a residence time much longer than the oceanic mixing time. As a result, δ7LiSW, δ11BSW, and δ26MgSW, recorded by marine calcites reflect a global picture and secular variations in isotopic composition of these elements within periods shorter than their residence time must thus reflect imbalances between the sources and sinks of these elements to and from the ocean. Cenozoic δ7LiSW shows an abrupt 5‰ drop across the K-Pg boundary, simultaneous with the seawater Ir and Os isotope spikes. This rapid decrease in δ7LiSW is due to a large instantaneous delivery of isotopically light Li to the oceans and cannot be produced by an impactor nor by Deccan trap volcanism, suggesting large-scale continental denudation. We will create high-resolution δ7LiSW, δ11BSW, and δ26MgSW records across K-Pg boundary using planktonic and benthic foraminifera from multiple ODP/DSDP sites to quantify the amount of C excursion and the response of continental weathering feedbacks to regain climatic steady states. This multi-proxy approach will help quantify the extent of CCP; time scale and magnitude of continental chemical weathering response; and the contribution of both carbonate rock and silicate rock weathering in CO2 drawdown across carbon cycle excursion episodes.",

Our work is to apply an optimal search strategy introduced by Zoi and Pinder[1], with some modifications, to a field site in Nanjing City, China to define the strength, and location of DNAPL sources using the least samples. The overall strategy uses Monte Carlo stochastic groundwater flow and transport modeling, incorporates existing sampling data into the search strategy, and determines optimal sampling locations that are selected according to the reduction in overall uncertainty of the field and the proximity to the source locations. After a sample is taken, the plume is updated using a Kalman filter. The updated plume is then compared to the concentration fields that emanate from each individual potential source using fuzzy set technique. The comparison followed provides weights that reflect the degree of truth regarding the location of the source. The above steps are repeated until the optimal source characteristics are determined. Considering our site case, some specific modifications and work have been done as follows. K random fields are generated after fitting the measurement K data to the variogram model. The locations of potential sources that are given initial weights are targeted based on the field survey, with multiple potential source locations around the workshops and wastewater basin. Considering the short history (1999-2010) of manufacturing optical brightener PF at the site, and the existing sampling data, a preliminary source strength is then estimated, which will be optimized by simplex method or GA later. The whole algorithm then will guide us for optimal sampling and update as the investigation proceeds, until the weights finally stabilized.\n",

            "abstract": "Understanding the vertical profile of atmospheric aerosols plays a vital role in utilizing spaceborne, column-integrated satellite observations. The properties and distribution of light-absorbing aerosol are particularly uncertain despite significant air quality and climate ramifications. Advanced retrieval algorithms are able to derive complex aerosol properties (e.g., wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient and single scattering albedo) from remote-sensing measurements, but quantitative relationships to surface conditions remain a challenge. Highly systematic atmospheric profiling during four unique deployments for the NASA DISCOVER-AQ project (Baltimore, MD, 2011; San Joaquin Valley, CA, 2013; Houston, TX, 2013; Denver, CO, 2014) allow statistical assessment of spatial, temporal, and source-related variability for light-absorbing aerosol properties in these distinct regions. In-situ sampling in conjunction with a dense network of AERONET sensors also allows evaluation of the sensitivity, limitations, and advantages of remote-sensing data products over a wide range of conditions.\nIn-situ aerosol and gas-phase observations were made during DISCOVER-AQ aboard the NASA P-3B aircraft. Aerosol absorption coefficients were measured by a Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP). Approximately 200 profiles for each of the four deployments were obtained, from the surface (25-300m altitude) to 5 km, and are used to calculate absorption aerosol optical depths (AAODs). These are quantitatively compared to AAOD derived from AERONET Level 1.5 retrievals to 1) explore discrepancies between measurements, 2) quantify the fraction of AAOD that exists directly at the surface and is often missed by airborne sampling, and 3) evaluate the potential for deriving ground-level black carbon (BC) concentrations for air quality prediction. Aerosol size distributions are used to assess absorption contributions from mineral dust, both at the surface and aloft. SP2 (Single Particle Soot Photometer) mixing state and coating thickness analyses will be explored to explain in-situ/AERONET discrepancies, and ground-based absorption coefficient and BC-mass observations will be utilized whenever possible to fully obtain the true absorption vertical profile.",

Active extension is precisely measured by a dense distribution of GPS stations belonging to several networks, thanks also to additional sites recently installed in the framework of the INGV national RING network and of the ATF observatory. Advanced Interferometry SAR (A-InSAR) techniques play today a key role in Earth Sciences thanks to their capability to detect and monitor slow surface movements over wide areas. A-InSAR techniques, along with in-situ ground measurements, can provide suitable information on the causes of interseismic (seismic, creep) movements. Large datasets of SAR images of European (ERS 1-2 and ENVISAT) and Italian (COSMO-SKyMed) satellites have been used to retrieve surface velocity maps and relevant time series from 1992 to 2014, along both ascending and descending orbits. A network of artificial Corner Reflectors has also been deployed in the proximity of some GPS sites in order to calibrate the processing results of the COSMO-SkyMed SAR data-set and to derive velocity maps.\nWe use an elastic Block Modeling (BM) approach in order to model GPS data by considering the major fault systems as bounds of rotating blocks, while estimating geodetic fault slip-rates.,Thanks to the latest imaging of its deep structure obtained from seismic profiles, the ATF is represented as a complex rough surface with the goal of evaluating the distribution of interseismic fault coupling. The preliminary results obtained show firstly that the observed extension is partially accommodated by interseismic deformation on the ATF, highlighting the important role of this LANF inside an active tectonic contest. Secondarily, using the ATF surface “topography”, we found for the resolved areas an interesting correlation between microseismicity and creeping portions of the ATF.\nThus we integrate A-InSAR results and GPS velocities in order to use such data within a BM approach, with the aim that the availability of high-resolution data will contribute to understand better the behavior of this LANF and to evaluate the seismic potential associated to this geologic structure.",

While intersecting the TMR the closely E-W trending trace of the GF system is slightly deflected (changing to WNW-ESE), and splays into several fault branches that often coincide with aligned (TMR related?) active volcanic plugs. The segment of the plate boundary between the TMR and the Gorringe Bank (further to the East) corresponds to a more complex (less discrete) tectonic configuration, within which the tectonic connection between the Gloria Fault and another major dextral transcurrent system (the so called SWIM system) occurs. This SWIM fault system has been described to extend even further to the East (almost until the Straits of Gibraltar) across the Gulf of Cadiz domain. In this domain the relative movement between the Eurasian and the African plates is thought to be accommodated through a diffuse manner, involving large scale strain partition between a dextral transcurrent fault-system (the SWIM system), and a set of active west-directed én-échelon major thrusts extending to the North along the SW Iberian margin.\nWe present new analog modeling results, in which we employed different experimental settings to address (namely) the following main questions (as a first step to gain new insight on the tectonic evolution of the TRM-GF critical intersection area): Could the observed morphotectonic configuration of such intersection be simply caused by a bathymetric anomaly determined by a postulated thickened oceanic crust, or is it more compatible with a crustal rheological (viscous) anomaly, possibly related with the active volcanism in the intersection zone? What could cause the observed deflection and splaying of the GF in the intersection with the TMR? Is the GF cutting across the TMR, or is it ending against a morpho-rheological anomaly through waning lateral propagation?",

            "abstract": "Recently there has been a raft of manuscripts which claim to show that arctic amplification (AA, largely due to increased thermal forcing around the time of the late-summer sea-ice minimum) is responsible for broad changes in the large-scale wintertime mid-latitude atmospheric circulation patterns and could even lead to an increase in extreme weather events. A number of responses to these studies have shown that the results are likely artefacts of the chosen methodology, but do not discount the potential influence of AA on the mid-latitude circulation. Relatively few studies have demonstrated physical mechanisms or physical pathways by which AA may drive a lagged atmospheric response. In this investigation we employ a linear stationary wave model to investigate the hypothesis that AA, in the form of a low-level anomalous heating of the atmosphere, may drive a lagged mid-latitude circulation response. A change in the quasi-stationary wave pattern may be regarded as a necessary though not sufficient condition for any subsequent changes in the frequency, timing or magnitude of extreme events. The low-order model is well suited to the question due to its ability to reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation, and its simplicity – as it requires only four forcing components plus the zonal mean state from reanalysis or a GCM, interpreting the model results is relatively straightforward. An ensemble of simulations are performed with idealized low-level diabatic heatings imposed in regions matching the observed thermal anomaly maxima during the record sea-ice minimum event of 2012. The preliminary results are presented here and we evaluate the atmospheric response of the mid-latitude stationary waves, if any, to the heating and identify the driving mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Kriging has recently been revived as a powerful tool for predicting the outcome of costly numerical experiments and for guiding simulator evaluations, be it for optimization, inversion, or uncertainty quantification purposes. One key requirement for a successful application of Kriging is to formulate a suitable covariance (or variogram) model reflecting the (dis)similarity between locations or “inputs”, in the sense that two inputs with a high covariance (or a low variogram) value are expected to correspond to close outcomes. Here we present an approach where the inputs can be very high-dimensional, like curves and maps, or even not identifiable as vectors, like shapes or geological scenarios. We extend the Kriging methodology to a very general set-up where a collection of inputs is given together with some measure of similarity between them, the response of interest is known only for a subset of the inputs, and predictions of the response are needed for the remaining inputs. The proposed Similarity Based Kriging (SBK) method relies on the combination of Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) together with some well-chosen class of positive definite kernels. Possible degrees of freedom that govern the similarity measure and the MDS algorithms employed as well as the selected kernel make it a very versatile approach. Provided a relevant (dis)similarity measure between inputs is available, SBK appears as a simple and powerful method for predicting the outcome of complex experiments in a dimension-free set-up. After a global introduction to SBK, we will present results that concern the optimal tuning of MDS and kernel parameters. The potential of SBK for prediction and adaptive experimental design in geosciences will finally be illustrated using data sets from aquifer modelling and beyond.",

            "abstract": "We use particle-in-cell PIC 3D Electromagnetic, relativistic global code to address large-scale problems in magnetosphere electrodynamics. Terrestrial bow shock is simulated as an example. 3D Magnetohydrodynamics model ,MHD GUMICS in CCMC project, have been used in parallel with PIC under same scaled Solar wind (SW) and IMF conditions. We report new results from the coupling between the two models. Further investigations are required for confirmations of these results. In both codes the Earth's bow shock position is found at ~14.8 RE along the Sun-Earth line, and ~29 RE on the dusk side which is consistent with past in situ observation. Both simulations reproduce the theoretical jump conditions at the shock. However, PIC code density and temperature distributions are inflated and slightly shifted sunward when compared to MHD results. Reflected ions upstream of the bow shock may cause this sunward shift for density and temperature. Distribution of reflected ions and electrons are shown in the foreshock region, within the transition of the shock and in the downstream. The current version of PIC code can be run under modest computing facilities and resources. Additionally, existing MHD simulations should be useful to calibrate scaled properties of plasma resulting from PIC simulations for comparison with observations. Similarities and drawbacks of the results obtained by the two models are listed. The ultimate goal of using these different models in a complimentary manner rather than competitive is to better understand the macrostructure of the magnetosphere",

            "abstract": "The Water Framework Directive 60/2000/EC requires European Union member states to ensure good status of water bodies. To this end, it requires to identify relevant pressures (e.g. diffuse pollution) on waters, to address them through appropriate measures (e.g. enforce good agricultural practices), and to report both pressures and measures to the European Commission (EC). In spite of existing assessment guidance, member states report about pressures in a rather heterogeneous way. This has stimulated the EC to undertake a comparison between the pressures reported by the member states with those depicted by Europe-wide model-based indicators. This alone has required turning model results to communicable maps to be used in a decision making context with minimal risk of interpretive distortion. The comparison suggests that the identification of relevant pressures at the continental scale is not always the same as at the national and regional scale, causing difficulties in the prioritization of investments and doubts about the effectiveness of envisaged measures. A simple rank-based classification has been used to map the level of agreement between pressures reported by the member states and the corresponding European indicators, highlighting regions where a more detailed insight is required in order to come to a shared judgment on pressures hampering the achievement of good water body status. Reported pressures may suffer from incompleteness and semantic uncertainty, while European indicators suffer from model uncertainties and errors. A discussion of differences between European indicators and river basin assessments in the light of agreed-upon reporting and model limitations may help to collaboratively improve the assessment from both sides, and consequently to design more effectively the measures to be implemented at the respective levels. We present and discuss the case study, highlighting how the approach may be useful in contexts of transnational water management.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is the source of water for evapotranspiration over the continents and it participates in both energy and water balance of the earth. Soil moisture participates in the energy cycle by managing the partitioning of the energy budget into latent and sensible heat, there by influencing the hydrological cycle. But to better understand the influence of soil moisture on the hydrological cycle, large scale monitoring is required. The objective of this study is to qualitatively analyze the active-passive merged soil moisture distribution, prepared under the ESA_CCI programme, against two AMSR-E soil moisture distributions, AMSR-E/NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) and AMSR-E/VUA(Virje Universiet Amstradam) and GLDAS_NOAH model simulations. The ESA_CCI soil moisture distribution is also compared with the GPCC monthly precipitation distribution to observe the representativeness of the precipitation seasonality in the satellite retrieved soil moisture. India has been selected as the study area, esp. the Central Indian region, as it has shown to be a soil moisture hot-spot for land-surface atmosphere interaction. The preliminary study show that both ESA_CCI and AMSR-E/VUA soil moisture distributions capture similar seasonal patterns in addition to processes like rainfall events and inter-annual variations. In addition to this it was also observed that the soil moisture distribution of ESA_CCI and AMSR-E/VUA are linearly related to each other for more than 50% of the land points. In case of ESA_CCI and AMSR-E/NSIDC, the soil moisture distributions are able to capture similar seasonal patterns but not the random events and they also do not show a strong linear relationship. We also analyze the effect of topography and vegetation distribution on the error charactristics of the satellite retrieved soil moisture distributions.",

            "abstract": "The sequence of 4 large earthquakes of magnitude 8 and more, which occurred in Mongolia and its border during the XX century, is unique in the world. Starting in 1905 July 7 by the Tsetserleg earthquake of Mw≈8, it was followed by the great Bolnay earthquake the 1905 July 23 Mw≈8.4, the FuYun earthquake the 1931 August 10 Mw≈8, and the Bogd (Gobi-Altay) earthquake the 1957 December 4 Mw≈8.1. The seismicity recorded since 1964 by the RCAG (Research Center of Astronomy and Geophysics, Mongolia) is concentrated, still up to now, along the large surfaces ruptures induced by theses four events with a cumulative length of more than 1000 km. We do not observe such high seismicity along the other active faults in the region that produced similar large events several centuries ago. The recurrence period estimated of these large earthquakes is more than 3000 years related to the low deformation rate along the faults (estimated between 1 to 3 mm/year). Thus, an important part of the observed seismicity is related to “late aftershocks”.\nDespite the seismic network started to cover Mongolia only by 1964, it covers a period allowing us to reconstruct one century of aftershocks decay by combining these 4 events of “similar” magnitude. The completeness magnitude of the catalog is considered over various periods. Yet, the area of the 1905 events has a more complex aftershocks behavior probably due to the proximity of the Hovsgol extension basin at the north and the close location of the two 1905 events (the rupture of the Bolnay event touches the ones of the Tsetserleg). We show the very long duration of aftershocks related to such great intracontinental earthquakes. Therefore, the hazard assessment in such context should include the aftershocks as a characteristic of the area.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative estimates of the composition of the Late Archean atmosphere are integral to deciphering the drivers of planetary oxygenation in the early Paleoproterozoic. However, the majority of geochemical proxies from marine sediments only inform on planetary redox via inference, making direct constraints on the ancient atmosphere difficult to place. Fortunately, the quadruple S-isotope (QSI) record (δ34S, Δ33S, and Δ36S) is implicitly tied to the composition of the ancient atmosphere.\nWe have generated coupled QSI and δ13COrg records from two cores through the Transvaal basin in South Africa (GKF01 and BH1-Sacha) and from three time-equivalent cores through the Hammersley basin in Western Australia. These records reveal similar, apparently synchronous, co-variation between deviations from “typical” Neoarchean Δ36S/Δ33S values and negative δ13COrg values (C-S anomalies). We have interpreted these trends to reflect increased incorporation of 13C-depleted substrates (methane) into sedimentary matter following apparently episodically enhanced methanogenesis in the prelude to the GOE. These records suggest the terminal Neoarchean atmosphere operated in a bi-stable fashion, oscillating between a clear skies and organic-rich hazy state (Zerkle et al., 2010; Izon et al., in review).\nWe speculate that these C-S anomalies reflect enhanced nutrient availability, facilitating the proliferation of an oxygenic photosynthetic/methanogenic biosphere, concomitantly amplifying biogenic CH4 and O2 fluxes and altering atmospheric chemistry. Here we present a new S- and C-isotope data set, derived at unprecedented resolution, encompassing the youngest C-S anomaly identified in core GKF01. These analyses will be combined with Fe-speciation and trace-metal data to elucidate whether atmospheric methane levels were regulated by climatically driven changes in nutrient fluxes to the marine biosphere. Taken together, our research serves as an initial foray to determine how, and why, the early Earth redox balance shifted, initiating oxygenation and ultimately spawning a habitable planet capable of supporting macroscopic life.",

            "abstract": "Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi remains one of the most useful benthic species in paleoceanographic studies due to its epibenthic lifestyle and use in geochemical studies. However, misconceptions exist about this important taxon. Genetic comparisons with Genbank have shown that C. wuellerstorfi living in the Pacific are the same species as those in the North Atlantic, and the Antarctic. Sediment cores taken on a transect through the Southern California Bight oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) have shown that C. wuellerstorfi make up as much as 11.2% of the stained population despite oxygen-poor conditions (0.47-0.63 mL/L with water depths ranging from 360-3000m). Living C. wuellerstorfi has also been found to inhabit many areas of methane seepage with available oxygen levels as low as 0.23mL/L. Colonization of experimental substrates at Hydrate Ridge revealed substantial colonization within 12 months (~1,000 individuals/~5,000cm3) and preference between substrate materials (e.g. abundance on plastic and absence on adjacent wood). As in other seep studies; stable carbon isotopic values of C. wuellerstorfi of Hydrate Ridge seeps exhibit a wider range than their non-seep counterparts. Stable carbon isotopes at Hydrate Ridge were significantly different between seep and non-seep locations despite having an overlapping range. Changes in seep fluid characteristics (e.g. temperature and composition) are evidently recorded in the δ18O of benthic foraminiferal calcite at methane seeps and hydrothermal seeps in the Pacific. The use of δ18O of benthic foraminiferal calcite may hold promise as a valuable means to assess seep characteristics, especially in recognizing and evaluating hydrothermal seeps.\nThese results have significant implications for the cosmopolitan distribution, ecophenotypic variation, and genetic exchange of C. wuellerstorfi. The prevalence of C. wuellerstorfi in areas of low oxygen availability shows that this species is able to thrive in oxygen-poor habitats, and provides strong evidence that this taxon is not a reliable indicator of oxygen rich environments. Geochemical results suggest that there is a relationship between seeping fluids and foraminiferal calcite geochemistry and implying that novel geochemical relationships should be further explored at cold and hydrothermal seeps.",

Two orogens that contain such oblique elements, the Pan-African Araçuai-Ribeira belt and the Caledonian orogen, are here discussed and compared. While the Scandinavian Caledonides are a relatively cool orogen owing to rapid subduction and quick subsequent exhumation, the Brazilian example is much hotter (>750 °C), with widespread partial melting (>30% melt volume). This makes for an interesting comparison both with respect to orogen-perpendicular and oblique convergence and divergence.\nIn general, the northern section of the Araçuai-Ribeira belt in Brazil (the N-S oriented Araçuaí part) experienced more or less margin-perpendicular contraction, while the NE-SW oriented southern (Ribeira) section was strongly influenced by dextral transpression. The transpressive Ribeira section has a ~150 km wide network of transcurrent shear zones. A possible analog to this zone is the Møre-Trøndelag shear zone in the Caledonides, which also defines a marked regional change in the trend of the orogen. This shear zone is located in the hottest (>650 °C) part of the Scandinavian Caledonides, but has a width of only ~50 km. While several factors may have an influence on this difference in width between the laterally sheared Ribeira belt and the Møre-Trøndelag shear zone, we suspect that the cooler and therefore more rigid nature of the Caledonides may have imposed an important rheologic control on the way that strain is distributed in the middle crust. This goes for the contractional phase, but also for the postcollisional transtensional phase during which multiple crustal-scale shear zones formed or reactivated in the Caledonides. Caledonian extension/transtension structures involve extensive reactivation of Caledonian thrusts, but also formation of new extensional shear zones and faults. Hence the fact that post-collisional transtension/extension structures are better defined and more localized in the Caledonides than in the Araçuai-Ribeira belt may relate to the temperature difference between the two orogens.",

            "abstract": "A new paleobiological proxy for Antarctic paleoclimate history provides insight into past extent of open marine shelves on Wilkes Land margin, and calls for reassessment of IRD interpretations in the deep-sea. Marine, epiphytic benthic diatoms that grow attached to macroalgae (seaweed) are recovered in Miocene sediment from DSDP Site 269. They suggest periodic presence of floating rafts or ‘biotic oases’ in the Southern Ocean comprising buoyant macroalgae, attached benthic diatoms, and biota associated with this displaced coastal community. Macroalgae attach to the substrate with a holdfast, a multi-fingered structure that serves as an anchor. Uprooted holdfasts attached to buoyant macroalgae can raft sedimentary particles, some large (>50 kg), into the deep-sea. In addition, a rich biota of associated invertebrates live in cavities within the holdfast, the dispersal of which may explain the biogeographic distribution of organisms on Subantarctic islands. The stratigraphic occurrence of large, benthic epiphytic diatoms of genera Arachnoidiscus, Isthmia, Rhabdonema, Gephyra, Trigonium, and smaller Achnanthes, Cocconeis, Grammatophora, and Rhaphoneis in sediment cores from DSDP Site 269 reflect a rich, productive epiphytic diatom flora that maintained its position in the photic zone attached to their buoyant seaweed hosts. Amphipods and other herbivores grazed the benthic diatoms and produced diatom-rich fecal pellets that were delivered to the sea-floor. The discontinuous stratigraphic occurrence of the epiphytic diatoms, amongst the background of planktonic diatoms in Core 9 of DSDP Site 269, suggests environmental changes induced by either warm or cold events may have controlled the production and/or release of the macroalgae into the deep-sea. Warm events led to increased shelf areas, and cold events led to formation of ice on the macroalgae to increase their buoyancy and lift-off. Complicating the distinction between warm and cold events is the potential for the transport of sediment within the holdfast, biologically-rafted-debris (BRD). Identifying the abundance and provenance of the terrigeneous sediment may help to distinguish the climate and source-area signal of this complex relationship and refine the use of epiphytic diatoms as a paleoclimate and stratigraphic tool.",

            "abstract": "The transformation of swell waves from deep water across reef flats is the primary process regulating energy regimes in coral reef systems. The geomorphic evolution of a coral reef is dependent on this process, yet there have been comparatively few studies focusing on wave processes on coral reefs when compared to siliciclastic settings. Of these studies none have recorded storm wave propagation across reef flats. This is a significant oversight since major geomorphic change occurs during storm events with some studies considering coral reefs as event based systems that are primarily driven by high intensity stochastic events such as cyclones or storms. This study focuses on the transformation of swell waves generated by Tropical Cyclone Dylan (storm conditions, January 2014) across the windward reef flats in comparison to data collected during modal fair weather conditions (modal conditions). As such the data sets used in this study are novel due to the difficulty of accessing remote reef sites during storm events. Wave height on the reef flat was similar during modal and storm conditions with wave height primarily controlled by water depth. However, during storm conditions greater wave energy - particularly long period wave energy - and wave generated current velocity was observed despite the regulatory effects of water depth over the reef flat. The potential for sediment and coral rubble transport was much greater during storm conditions with limited sediment transport during modal conditions. This suggests that high frequency storm events are crucial processes driving sediment dynamics in coral reef systems.",

Pointer Ridge is a ridge situated on the passive China continental margin formed by down slope erosion of the continental slope material on either side of the ridge. High methane flux rate and several seismic chimneys were observed in this area from previous studies, which may imply active ongoing fluid migration processes. To find the possible fluid migration pathways and understand the fluid migration processes, we firstly use both 2D and 3D seismic images to map the spatial distribution of the BSRs, and to identify the structural and sedimentary features in our study area. Secondly, seismic attribute analyses are carried out for fluid migration pathways detection and fault seal analysis. Finally, we propose a conceptual model to illustrate how fluids migrate along those pathways to the seafloor. The results show that the fluid migration pathways obtained from seismic attribute analysis results correlate well with the chimney and fault structures recognized from conventional seismic amplitude sections. We suggest that high angle normal faults may play an important role for fluid migrating upward, and the ongoing fluid migration processes will increase the seafloor instabilities. Since the Pointer Ridge is a gas hydrate leaking site, our results could provide useful information for further risk evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) provides global estimates of future cumulative carbon dioxide emissions of anthropogenic origin, for various representative concentration pathways (RCP). For example, for an approximately 50% probability of limiting the increase in temperature to 2 deg. C, the table shows that the limit on cumulative global carbon-dioxide emissions is 780 Gt of carbon between 2012 and 2100. We can now ask what each nation will get as a share of the globally allowed cumulative emissions. Corresponding to this share of cumulative emissions, every nation will have the flexibility to consider a range of emissions trajectories within its share. This paper calculates the “entitlements” and potential emissions (based on some reasonable growth and reduction rates) using four different methods for all the four RCPs discussed in the IPCC report – i) simply allocating the remaining carbon space (for the period from 2012 to 2100) on a per capita basis amongst the regions; ii) calculating entitlements for the period between 1850 and 2100 based on total emissions emitted in the past and allowed in the future divided among countries on a per capita basis; iii) the entitlements calculated in (ii) are weighted by per capita GDP to include a measure of ‘capability’ while calculating entitlements; iv) the entitlements calculated in (ii) are weighted by non-income HDI as another measure of ‘capability’. The values are benchmarked against the potential emissions for the future resulting from the commitments already made by different countries and regions towards mitigation. The paper then goes on to provide an estimate for the avoided cost of carbon for India given a range of constraints on emissions that it will have to undertake as a part of such a schema of allocating the mitigation burden.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century, the northeastern United States has warmed by over 1C, with the region of strongest warming found in coastal Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. These states are amongst the fastest warming in the entire country and the region as a whole is also warming faster than the national average. While these records all appear exceptional in the context of the last century, it is not known how these compare on longer time scales, to potential preindustrial late Holocene warm epochs, and in the context of decadal-scale variability in regional climate. Here, we develop a January through August temperature reconstruction using three Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic White Cedar) chronologies in Massachusetts and Maine. The chronologies show a strong winter-spring-summer temperature signal representative of temperature variability from southern New York to northeastern Maine. The reconstruction is skillful and tracks upwards temperature trends since the early 19th century, reproducing decadal scale variability associated with warming from the 1920s through 1940s, cooling in the region from the 1940s until the 1960s, and warming since that time. No year since at least the middle of the 19th century is as warm as the Janaury through August temperatures seen in the exceptionally warm 2012. Recent modeling experiments simulate a range of decadal warming trends for the northeastern United States that is slightly higher than the reconstructed and instrumental trends. Atlantic White Cedar holds the potential to develop multicentury temperature reconstructions from this heavily-populated region.",

We present self-consistent thermo-mechanical models to study oceanic subduction, slab retreat, and back arc formation. We focus on two aspects of the subduction process: 1) factors that control retreat of the subduction zone, and 2) those that control the opening of the back arc. The model evolution is calculated using 2D plane strain thermo-mechanical finite element techniques for the finite element solution of incompressible viscous-plastic creeping flows (Fullsack, 1995). The models extend from the surface to 660 km depth. The upper surface of the model is free to move. We investigate interaction of the subducting slab with the overlying plate and focus on factors that may control the opening of a back-arc basin. The down going plate is driven by a kinematic boundary condition, far from the subduction zone. After an initial stage of far-field driven contraction, negative buoyant down welling of the oceanic lithosphere may drive continued subduction zone leading to mature subduction and the formation of an extensional back arc. The models suggest that two primary factors are required for slab retreat and the formation of an extensional back-arc system: 1) Convective destabilization and weakening of the overlying continental back arc region, and 2) sufficient negative buoyancy of the subducting plate.",

The main area of 3D coverage extends from 9º42-57’N, spanning the seafloor extent of two documented volcanic eruptions. There, the 3D geometry of the mid-crustal axial magma lens (AML), located ~1.5 km below the seafloor, was initially investigated using a best 1D stacking velocity function hung from the seafloor and two-pass post-stack time migration. Preliminary results suggested a relatively narrow (~0.5-1.8 km wide) AML showing fingering and overlap of individual magma bodies, particularly in association with several small-scale ridge-axis discontinuities identified from seafloor morphology and structure of the axial summit trough. A westward-dipping limb of the AML was imaged near 9º51’N, where the AML attains its largest width. From 9º53-56’N, the AML was seen to veer slightly westward, in accordance with a shift in orientation of the ridge. Sub-axial magma lenses (SAMLs) have been recently imaged between 9º20’ and 9º56’N on along-axis reflection profiles from the same survey, with the suggestion that these deeper lenses may have contributed melts to the 2005/06 eruption. In the cross-axis dataset, SAML events are observed down to ~600-700 ms (~1.7-2 km) below the AML. They sometimes appear slightly offset with respect to the center of the AML. They are generally less bright than the AML reflection, some of them display prominent diffraction tails on un-migrated sections, and the deeper events have a distinctly lower frequency content than the shallower ones. New images for the 9º42-57’N area are currently being generated from a suite of detailed stacking velocities for the AML and SAML events and 3D post-stack time migration, which will provide insight into the width and along-axis continuity of individual magma bodies at multiple levels within the crust. The fine-scale AML structure will be constrained from the reprocessed seismic volume, beyond the main features noted above. The 3D geometry of the AML and SAMLs will be discussed in relation with other ridge properties along this ~27-km long section of the EPR.",

            "abstract": "Along plate boundary subduction thrusts, the transformation of smectite to illite within fault gouge at temperatures of ~150C is one of the key mineralogical changes thought to control the updip limit of seismicity. Saffer and Marone (2003) reported illite shale exhibited only velocity-strengthening behavior, whereas illite is widely expected to be velocity-weakening behavior. The limitation of their experiments were temperature, in which the frictional experiments were csrried out at room temperature, although the updip limit of seismogenic zone is thermally controlled that occurs at temperature around 150C. Therefore, in this study, we determined the effect of temperature of frictional properties of smectite and illite and discuss whether the smectite-illite transition accounts for the updip limit of seismogenic zone along subduction thrust. In the frictional experiments, we determined the velocity dependence of sliding friction, which is a key parameter for stable or unstable sliding. After steady-state sliding, the loading velocity of 3 μm/s was abruptly changed to 33 μm/s in each frictional experiments to determine the velocity dependence of these clay minerals. The velocity dependence of both smectite and illite at room temperature shows always positive at normal stress higher than 40 MPa, which is similar to the results of Saffer and Marone (2003). However, at temperature of 200C, illite shows negative values of (a-b), suggesting that illite exhibits unstable velocity-weakening behavior. den Hartog et al. (2012) also showed the velocity-weakening for illite gouge by high temperature ring shear experiments, but the transition from velocity strengthening to weakening occurs at temperature around 250C. These results explain that smectite is potentially aseismic for stable sliding at the subduction thrust, whereas illite becomes seismic due to a negative velocity dependence and unstable sliding at high temperatures. Thus, the smectite-illite transition has a potential to explain the updip limit of seismogenic zone along subduction thrust.",

Agricultural development-driven LUCC at regional scales can alter surface energy budgets, evapotranspiration (ET) and rainfall; these hydroclimatic changes impact streamflows, and thus hydropower. To date, there is only limited empirical understanding of these complex land-water-energy nexus dynamics, yet understanding is important to developing countries where both agriculture and hydropower are expanding and intensifying.\nTo observe these changes and their interconnections, we synthesize a novel combination of ground network, remotely sensed, and empirically modeled data for LUCC, rainfall, flows, and hydropower potential. We connect the extensive temporal and spatial trends in LUCC occurring from 2000-2012 (and thus observable in the satellite record) to long-term historical flow records and run-of-river hydropower generation potential estimates. Changes in hydrologic condition are observed in terms of dry and wet season moments, extremes, and flow duration curves. Run-of-river hydropower generation potential is modeled at basin gauge points using equation models parameterized with literature-based low-head turbine efficiencies, and simple algorithms establishing optimal head and capacity from elevation and flows, respectively. Regression analyses are used to demonstrate a preliminary causal analysis of LUCC impacts to flow and energy, and discuss extension of the analysis to ungauged basins.\nThe results are transferable to tropical and transitional forest regions worldwide where simultaneous agricultural and hydropower development potentially compete for coupled components of regional water cycles, and where policy makers and planners require an understanding of LUCC impacts to hydroclimate-dependent industries and ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "This study presents luminosity and leader propagation during the initial breakdown (IB) stage of a cloud-to-ground flash, beginning at 6.06 km altitude and 31.86 ms before the return stroke. High-speed video (50,000 frames per s) and time-correlated electric field change data show multiple branch ends advance concurrently in the first 6 ms of the flash; each branch begins with IB pulses and propagates first via bursts as an initial leader. Burst luminosity (brightest pixel intensity) is directly related to the IB pulse amplitude. Some initial leader branches transition to advancing as stepped leaders after a few milliseconds. Each initial leader branch end makes the transition to a stepped leader branch end at a slightly different time, resulting in a complex E-change waveform having relatively narrow step-type pulses during the IB stage and no apparent Intermediate stage prior to the Leader stage. There is no visible evidence of an upward propagating leader end prior to the RS, nor of any light above the earliest visible IB luminosity prior to or during the RS. In the RS, the topmost visible portion of the channel that developed as an initial leader (above 5.1 km) appears different (dimmer and with slower speed) from the channel below, indicating it is less conductive. Radar and time-of-arrival lightning source data indicate that the IB luminosity visible to the camera comes from about 6 km deep inside the thundercloud echo. The 1276-m long initial leader transitions to a stepped leader near 4.9 km and the altitude of the radar bright band.",

Climate change is about people, about water, and about change itself. Understanding the rate of climate change, relative to the abilities of both humans and ecosystems to adapt is critical. I will briefly describe the multiple, independent lines of evidence that the climate is changing, and that the primary cause of this change is a change in atmospheric composition caused by the burning of fossil fuels. I will cover the history of climate change as seen within the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Navy, how this challenge is being addressed from budgetary, policy, and political angles, and what are the greatest challenges to national security that arise from climate change and in particular, the associated changes in the Arctic. I will conclude with an assessment of future challenges and opportunities regarding climate change, from science, policy, and political perspectives, and why we know enough to take significant action now, even if we don’t know every detail about the future. In addition, this talk will address how to effectively talk about climate change through the use of analogies, plain, non-jargon English, and even a little humor.",

            "abstract": "Large negative carbon (δ13C) and boron (δ11B) isotope excursions (both >6‰) within the widely distributed Neoproterozoic “Snowball Earth” cap carbonates are interpreted as evidence for considerable perturbation of the carbon cycle and the associated reduction, then recovery of global ocean pH. Yet, before conclusive interpretations may be drawn, isotopic data must first be shown to be primary in origin and non-diagenetic. Recent studies of Quaternary carbonate platform sediments from a number of locations worldwide reveal δ13C excursions of similar magnitude and distribution to the “Snowball Earth” excursions. However, these recent analogues were formed following eustatic sea level fall and exposure of recent carbonates to meteoric diagenesis (\nSwart and Kennedy, 2012\n). Here we present δ11B and B/Ca data from Pleistocene-aged carbonate platform sediments recovered by the Clino Core from the Bahamas to examine the effects of diagenesis on the boron system. We find that within the interval of meteoric diagenesis the δ11B of bulk carbonate is substantially reduced by approximately 6‰ in conjunction with a drop in B/Ca of 90%. These isotopic and elemental down-core patterns are strikingly similar to those reported for δ11B and B/Ca in the cap carbonates of the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth events (\nKasemann et al., 2005\n;\nKasemann et al., 2010\n). Our results may therefore question the primary nature of “Snowball Earth” isotope excursions. We recommend more rigorous assessment of the diagenetic history of these ancient carbonates to ensure palaeoclimatological interpretations are robust.",

However, their overall contribution is largely unconstrained, partly due to sampling campaigns with short measurement periods and few sampling locations against a backdrop of high spatiotemporal variations in the emissions. Using CH4 emission data from a total of 49 studies, we point out that high-end fluxes that average above 200 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 were measured during sampling intervals of 1 week or less. The range of these short-term fluxes is also twice that of those measured during sampling intervals of 3 months or longer. Further, measurements of small shallow thaw ponds are overrepresented in the literature, which adds error and complexity when scaling CH4 emissions regionally and globally. We use these and other examples to suggest improved sampling strategies that will reduce biases of CH4 emission estimates from high latitude inland waters.",

            "abstract": "Faults in shallow, unconsolidated sediment are often associated with aseismic creep, due to the velocity-strengthening behaviour of unconsolidated materials observed during lab experiments. They are expected to appear as broad zones of distributed deformation. However, large seismic ruptures can still propagate to the surface through shallow sediment, causing vast damage and destructive tsunamis. Our understanding of how seismic rupturing of shallow faults in unconsolidated sediment occurs in nature is limited due to the lack of direct observations constraining their structure, deformation patterns and mechanisms, and frictional behaviour.\nWe studied syn-depositional normal faults, which deform unconsolidated, saturated lake sediments of the palaeo-Dead Sea. The sediments belong to the Lisan Formation (~70-18 Ka) and comprise alternating 1-3 mm thick laminae of aragonite and ultrafine-grained detritus. The faults formed at the surface, the only overburden being the overlying water column, and are known to have hosted seismic slip during large events (M ≥ 6), due to their association with seismites. The faults are discrete, localized structures, which sharply truncate laminae in the host sediment. Slip surfaces are sharp and straight and accompanied by a narrow slip zone, up to 1 cm wide, but often ≤ 1 mm wide, containing ultrafine-grained gouge. The majority of slip, up to 3 m, is concentrated in these slip zones. Faults can be categorised as having either simple geometry (one continuous fault strand accommodates all the displacement) or complex geometry (two or more fault segments share the overall displacement). Slip profiles constructed for simple geometry faults all have similar shapes, regardless of maximum displacement, whereas those for complex geometry faults are highly variable, due to segment interaction. It is apparent from the slip profiles that these faults grow and interact in the same way as ‘brittle’ faults in cohesive rocks.\nWe will present results of microstructural analyses of the fault rocks, to constrain the deformation mechanisms occurring during seismic slip in unconsolidated sediment. We will also present results of low- and high-velocity friction experiments, which will constrain the conditions under which brittle deformation and seismic slip occur in these materials.",

            "abstract": "Recent research on an agricultural maize canopy has demonstrated that leaf water content can change considerably during the day and in response to water stress. Model simulations suggest that these changes have a significant impact on backscatter, particularly in times of water stress. Radar is already used for several vegetation and soil monitoring applications and might be used for water stress detection in agricultural canopies. Radar observations of the land surface are sensitive because it results in two-way attenuation of the reflected signal from the soil surface, and vegetation contributes to total backscatter from the canopy itself. An important driver that determines the impact of vegetation on backscatter is the dielectric constant of the leaves, which is primarily a function of their moisture content. Understanding the effects of water stress on the dynamics of leaf dielectric properties might shed light on how radar can be used to detect vegetation water stress. Previous studies have investigated the dielectric properties of vegetation. However this has mainly been done using destructive sampling rather than in-vivo measurements. Unfortunately, few in-vivo measurements of vegetation dielectric properties exist. This study presents datasets of in-vivo dielectric measurements of maize leaves, taken during two field experiments. One experiment was done using was done during a period of water stress, the other during a period without. Field measurements revealed a vertical profile in dielectric properties during both the period with and without water stress. During a period of increased water stress, the diurnal dynamics of leaves at different heights responded differently to a decrease in bulk moisture content. This study provides insight in the effect of water stress on vegetation dielectric properties and highlights the potential use of radar for water stress detection in agricultural canopies.",

            "abstract": "We report on the solar phenomena associated with the longitudinal extent of the solar energetic particle (SEP) event observed on 2013 April 11. SEPs were observed over a wide range of heliolongitudes by STEREO and near-Earth spacecraft. We use EUV and white-light coronagraph observations from SDO, SOHO, and STEREO to analyze the angular extent of the EUV and CME-driven shock waves associated with the SEP event. We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each spacecraft with that of the arrival of the CME-associated waves at the footpoints of the magnetic field lines connecting each spacecraft to the solar surface. Whereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock at the footpoint of STEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the observed particles, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint of magnetic field lines connecting near-Earth spacecraft to the solar surface even though an intense SEP event was observed there. Modeling of the propagation of the CME-driven shock wave at high coronal altitudes shows that the latter was most likely the source of the particles observed near Earth. The present analysis shows that the angular extent of the EUV wave on the solar surface does not agree with the longitudinal extent of the SEP event in the heliosphere. Hence EUV waves cannot be used consistently as a proxy for the solar phenomena that accelerates and injects energetic particles over broad ranges of longitudes.

            "abstract": "Recent MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) findings, corroborated by petrologic modeling, reviewed the surface composition of Mercury as mainly constituted by low-Fe and Mg-rich basalts. This interpretation dismisses the previously assessed widespread presence of more felsic materials - as on the Moon’s surface - leaving open the question of the crust petrogenesis of Mercury. Assessing the presence of a differentiated crust on the surface of Mercury is among the intrinsic objectives of the next ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission to Mercury. The ESA Mercury Planetary Orbiter will carry the Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (MERTIS, 7-14 µm), which will map the surface mineralogical composition of the planet. The interpretation of spectra collected along a wide range of daily surface temperatures is complicated by the relocation of the band minima depending on the temperature (e.g., Helbert et al. 2013). In addition, the simultaneous presence of different minerals, each one with its characteristic thermal expansion coefficient, results in a more difficult interpretation of the spectra. In this work we examine the spectral variations of linear mixtures of plagioclase and pyroxenes that most likely could be present in the differentiated igneous crust of Mercury, in addition to the T-dependent spectral variations of the single constituents. Furthermore we show how two different thermal expansion coefficients combined in the same sample reveal in a thermal infrared spectrum. To this aim we measure high-T emissivity - up to 725K - of natural binary compositions (e.g., anorthosite, gabbro, norite) and their single-phase components, whose chemistries are provided by microprobe analyses. Besides spectroscopy, all the provided samples are analyzed before and after the heat-treatment using X-Ray Diffraction, in order to verify any possible variation due to the annealing.",

            "abstract": "Zones of continent collision form mountain ranges with high topographies and complex geometries. Compressional stresses during ongoing convergence result in crustal thickening and localized deformation, where crustal material is transported and redistributed within the orogen.\nWe use numerical high-resolution thermo-mechanical models to investigate the physical processes of continent collision zones and its implications on rock exhumation. We demonstrate that compression of two continental blocks, separated by a rheologically weak suture zone can result in (i) doubly-vergent (Fig. A) or (ii) single-sided orogens (Fig. B), with distinct geometries, deformation and exhumation patterns. The transition between these different modes of collision is strongly controlled by the rheology of the continental lithosphere and therefore its temperature distribution. Doubly-vergent orogens form at relatively high thermal gradients, while single-sided orogens are typical for lower ones.\nDoubly-vergent orogens (Fig. A) are formed in response to the gradual accretion of crustal material to the upper plate along retro-shears. In these models continental subduction results in upper plate deformation and nested exhumation against retro-shears. Typical examples include the collision recorded by the Swiss Alps and the Pyrenees. In contrast, single-sided orogens are characterized by large-scale lower plate deformation and are accompanied by the subduction of lower crustal material (Fig. B). Modeling infers that shortening and associated exhumation will gradually propagate towards the foreland. In this situation, no significant retro-shear formation is observed, which is in agreement with recent physical modelling studies on deformation of the continental lithosphere [Willingshofer et al., 2013]. Natural examples of such single sided orogens are common in the Mediterranean (Carpathians, Dinarides, Apennines, Betics) or the SE Asia subduction zones.\nWe conclude that deformation and exhumation in continent-continent collision zones may occur in foreland or hinterland settings, depending on the rheological structure of the continental lithosphere, forming single-sided or doubly vergent orogens.",

            "abstract": "Allanite Th-U-Pb age-dating has recently been found to be powerful in unraveling the timing of geological processes such as the metamorphic dynamics in subduction zones and crystallization velocity of magmas. However, inconsistencies among analytical techniques have raised doubts about the accuracy of allanite age data. Spot analysis techniques such as LA-ICP-MS are claimed to be crucially dependent on matrix-matched standards, the quality of which is variable.\nWe present a new approach in LA-ICP-MS data reduction that allows non-matrix-matched standardization via well constrained zircon reference materials as primary standards. Our data were obtained using a GeoLas Pro 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation system coupled to an ELAN DRC-e quadrupole ICP-MS. We use 32 µm and 24 µm spot sizes; laser operating conditions of 9 Hz repetition rate and 2.5 J/cm2 fluence have proven advantageous. Matrix dependent downhole fractionation evolution is empirically determined by analyzing 208Pb/232Th and 206Pb/238U and applied prior to standardization. The new data reduction technique was tested on three magmatic allanite reference materials (SISSb, CAPb, TARA); within error these show the same downhole fractionation evolution for all allanite types and in different analytical sessions, provided measurement conditions remain the same. Although the downhole evolution of allanite and zircon differs significantly, a link between zircon and allanite matrix is established by assuming CAPb and TARA to be fixed at the corresponding reference ages. Our weighted mean 208Pb/232Th ages are 30.06 ± 0.22 (2σ) for SISSb, 275.4 ± 1.3 (2σ) for CAPb, and 409.9 ± 1.8 (2σ) for TARA. Precision of single spot age data varies between 1.5 and 8 % (2σ), dependent on spot size and common lead concentrations. Quadrupole LA-ICP-MS allanite age-dating has thus similar uncertainties as do other spot analysis techniques. The new data reduction technique is much less dependent on quality and homogeneity of allanite standard reference materials. This method of correcting for matrix-dependent downhole fractionation evolution opens new possibilities in the field of LA-ICP-MS data acquisition, e.g. the use of a NIST standard glass to date all material types given a set of well constrained reference materials.",

A deep geological CO2 storage is not expected to leak but potential impacts on groundwater have to be studied. A better understanding on how it could affect groundwater quality, aquifer minerals and trace elements is necessary to characterize a future storage site. Moreover, monitoring and remediation solutions have to be evaluated before storage operations. As part of the ANR project CIPRES, we present here reactive transport works.\n In a 3D model using ToughReact v.2, we perform different CO2 leakage scenarios in a confined aquifer, considering CO2 gas leakage. The model is based on the Albian aquifer, a strategic water resource. It takes into account groundwater and rock chemistry of the Albian green sand layer (Quartz, Glauconite, Kaolinite) at 700 m deep. The geochemical model was elaborated from experimental data. The aquifer consists in a mesh, divided roughly in 20000 cells making a 60 m thick and a 500 m large layer. Furthermore, cells are subdivided near the leakage point to consider local phenomena (secondary precipitation, sorption/desorption...). The chemical model takes into account kinetics for mineral dissolution, ion exchange and surface complexation.\n We highlight the importance of sorption processes on trace element transport (As, Zn and Ni) in fresh groundwater. Moreover, we distinguish different geochemical behavior (CO2 plume shape, secondary precipitation, desorption...) according to different horizontal flow rates influenced by the hydrodynamics (regional gradient). Understanding how geochemical processes and regional flows influence water chemistry, allows to ascertain measurement monitoring and verification plan and remediation works in case of leak considering a given location.",

To couple the different parts of our system we use the Basic Model Interface (BMI) as developped in the CSDMS community.\nStarting point of the eWaterCycle project was the PCR-GLOBWB model built by Utrecht University. The software behind this model has been partially re-engineered in order to enable it to run in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment, and to be able to interface using BMI, and run on multiple compute nodes in parallel. The final aim is to have a spatial resolution of 1km x 1km, (currently 10 x 10km).\nFor the data assimilation we make heavy use of the OpenDA system. This allows us to make use of different data assimilation techniques without the need to implement these from scratch. We have developped a BMI adaptor for OpenDA, allowing OpenDA to use any BMI compatible model. As a data assimilation technique we currently use an Ensemble Kalman Filter, and are working on a variant of this technique optimized for HPC environments.\nOne of the next steps in the eWaterCycle project is to couple the model with a hydrodynamic model. Our system will start a localized simulation on demand based on triggers in the global model, giving detailed flow and flood forecasting in support of navigation and disaster management.\nWe will show a live demo of our system, including real-time integration of satellite data.",

            "abstract": "The critical zone (CZ) is characterized by the duality between mass transport processes such as diffusion and flow of gases, fluids, and solids and localized bio-geochemical interactions especially linked to the “immobile” capillary/adsorbed water. Open questions are towards the role of capillarity onto reactive mechanisms: is there a geochemical signature of capillary water that can change the bio-geochemical balance? The research efforts focused on this issue to develop modeling tools integrating capillary effects at the soil-profile or CZ scale.\nWater suction gains geochemical significance when ranging from 20 to 200 MPa, meaning high tension and low amount of stretched water with its specific thermophysical properties (Mercury and Tardy, 2001; Mercury et al., 2003; 2004; Pettenati et al., 2008). Therefore, our interest is directed to the dry end of the water retention curve (WRC). The recent model from Silva and Grifoll (2007) proposed a full-range soil-water retention functions, extending the description to the adsorbed films down to the monolayer thickness. At this stage, it becomes possible to evaluate the role of both capillary pockets and adsorbed films at all water content in the geochemical dynamics of non-saturated soils. We developed from that point by fitting the WRC not through a continuous porous network, but through a decomposition into two porous domains (immobile/mobile domains), each with its own potential-water content law. This amounts to treat the WRC according to an intrinsic dual porosity scheme, and make easier to involve chemical effects at each potential-water content couple.\nA simple test simulation is developed with calcite rock kinetically interacting with immobile and mobile water, themselves connected by diffusive and advective gradients in the limits of the immobile-mobile contact area. The reactive transport simulations are run with HP1 (Jacques and Šimůnek, 2005). The mass balance exporting toward groundwater is calculated with and without capillary effects, according to a wide range of conditions (climate, recharge rate, water potential in each domain, etc). It demonstrates how the capillary component acts on the chemical dynamics at the CZ scale.\n Keywords: critical zone, unsaturated zone, capillarity, reactive transport modeling,“stretched water”.",

            "abstract": "A common assumption is that the modern day continental Si cycle is at steady-state. However, a new paradigm is emerging regarding the terrestrial biogeochemical Si cycle and its importance. We now know that the terrestrial Si cycle is strongly biologically mediated, which creates and recycles a pool of reactive Si in soils and sediments that ultimately buffers the export of dissolved silicate (DSi) to the oceans. Our recent results show that imbalances in the continental Si pool on millennial scales may have caused systematic mis-estimation of silicate weathering rates, particularly when using river chemistry at large spatial scales to calculate weathering rates. Quantifying this imbalance is essential to understand ocean-terrestrial biogeochemical interactions. On short (human) timescales large-scale changes in land cover, erosion and eutrophication have significantly altered the fluvial flux of Si. Likewise, periods of glacial-interglacial transitions produce new weathering products from the continents with subsequent impacts on oceanic DSi. Over still longer timescales significant changes in fluvial Si fluxes have probably occurred with large-scale changes in chemical weathering due to orogeny, climate change, the emplacement of large igneous provinces, or changes in volcanic activity. We will discuss the timescale dependency of processes and the assumption of steady state. In addition, we will examine how a changing terrestrial Si cycle impacts the ocean Si cycle. Finally, we will address unresolved questions regarding the delivery of Si to the oceans from the continents.",

Here we present data acquired during the first observations of the comet, starting from mid-July 2014, when the spacecraft-target distance was approximately 13000 km and the comet nucleus as seen by the instrument was pixel-size, up to the more recent acquisitions in which the surface was resolved. These far-approach data have allowed us to produce both light curves of the nucleus at different solar phase angles and disk-integrated phase curves over the entire instrument spectral range. The light curve is characterized by two asymmetric peaks due to the elongated, e.g. double-lobed, shape of the nucleus. The disk-integrated phase curves exhibit a back-scattering behavior. Comparisons with light curves and phase curves of other comets will be discussed, as well as the dependence of color ratios on rotational phase and phase angle in order to exploit surface compositional variations.

Much of the reactive organic halogen originates from biological processes in the surface ocean, which can be quite variable by season and location. The tropics and coastal margins are potentially important sources that are being examined.\nThe recent coordinated CONTRAST/ATTREX/CAST missions were conducted in the Western Tropical Pacific, a region that is a major transport pathway for tropospheric air entering the stratosphere. One of the goals of the missions was to identify sources, distributions, and transport of organic halogens from the ocean surface into the tropical lower stratosphere. The missions were conducted during the NH winter season, Jan-Feb, 2014. In this presentation, we will discuss the distributions and variability of organic halogen gases in the study region and will examine the input of organic halogen species into the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). Comparison with other tracers, such as methyl nitrate and NMHC, will help identify source regions for these gases. We will focus on the measurements obtained in the CONTRAST and ATTREX missions with data from in-situ GC/MS measurements and whole air samples collected on the NSF GV and NASA Global Hawk aircraft. Comparisons with other recent airborne campaigns, such as HIPPO and TC4, and with several ship-based studies will provide an additional context for evaluating the variability of organic halogen species in the tropical atmosphere and their role in transporting reactive halogen compounds into the UT/LS.",

            "abstract": "Limitation over region specific data on dust morphology (particle shape, size) and mineralogy gives rise to uncertainty in estimation of optical and radiative properties of mineral dust (Mishra and Tripathi, 2008; Mishra et al., 2008). To address this issue over Indian arid zone (local source of mineral dust), a short field campaign was organized in Jodhpur, located in Rajasthan, a north western state of India, over seven sites (four in city and three far from city) with varying altitudes in June 2013. Jodhpur lies in vicinity of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. Particles were collected on pure Tin substrates for individual particle morphological and elemental composition analysis using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). The morphological parameters (e.g. Aspect ratio; AR, Circulatory parameter; CIR.) were retrieved following Okada et al. (2001) using Image J software. Columnar spectral aerosol optical thickness has been measured by Microtops-II sun photometer for a set of five wavelengths (380 to 1020 nm) over all the sites in tandem with regional aerosol collection. SEM analysis reveals that the particles close to spherical shape (AR range 1.0-1.2) were found to be ~ 18% whereas particles with AR range 1.2-1.4 were found to be abundant (25%) followed with that of AR range 1.4-1.6 and 1.6-1.8 (each ~ 17%) and 1.8-2.0 (~ 14%) while the particles with AR >2 (highly non-spherical) were found to be ~ 8%. Here, it is noteworthy to mention that AR=1 for spherical particle while increasing AR (>1) exhibit increasing non-sphericity of particles. The EDS analysis reveals that 43% particles were observed with low hematite (H ≤ 1%; volume percentage), 24% (H 1-2 %), 14% (H 2-3%), 5% (H 3-4%) and 14% (H >4%). The aforementioned proportions will be extremely useful for simulating the optical and radiative properties of regional aerosols. From the Microtops-II observations, Ångström exponent for spectral interval of 380 to 1020 nm over Masuria Hill Garden was found to be the least (~0.55) amongst all the sites indicating the presence of coarse mode particles over this site. The SEM micrographs also reveal the dominance of coarse mode particles over this site. The correlation amongst all the observed parameters together with meteorological parameters will be discussed in detail.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes generate mass transport deposits (MTDs); megaturbidites (MTD overlain by coeval turbidite); multi-pulsed, stacked, and mud homogenite seismo-turbidites; tsunamites; and seiche deposits. The strongest (Mw 9) earthquake shaking signatures appear to create multi-pulsed individual turbidites, where the number and character of multiple coarse-grained pulses for correlative turbidites generally remain constant both upstream and downstream in different channel systems. Multiple turbidite pulses, that correlate with multiple ruptures shown in seismograms of historic earthquakes (e.g. Chile 1960, Sumatra 2004 and Japan 2011), support this hypothesis. The weaker (Mw = or < 8) (e.g. northern California San Andreas) earthquakes generate dominantly upstream simple fining-up (uni-pulsed) turbidites in single tributary canyons and channels; however, downstream stacked turbidites result from synchronously triggered multiple turbidity currents that deposit in channels below confluences of the tributaries. Proven tsunamites, which result from tsunami waves sweeping onshore and shallow water debris into deeper water, are a fine-grained turbidite cap over other seismo-turbidites. In contrast, MTDs and seismo-turbidites result from slope failures. Multiple great earthquakes cause seismic strengthening of slope sediment, which results in minor MTDs in basin floor turbidite system deposits (e.g. maximum run-out distances of MTDs across basin floors along active margins are up to an order of magnitude less than on passive margins). In contrast, the MTDs and turbidites are equally intermixed in turbidite systems of passive margins (e.g. Gulf of Mexico). In confined basin settings, earthquake triggering results in a common facies pattern of coeval megaturbidites in proximal settings, thick stacked turbidites downstream, and ponded muddy homogenite turbidites in basin or sub-basin centers, sometimes with a cap of seiche deposits showing bi-directional flow patterns.",

            "abstract": "During the TACTS aircraft campaign enhanced tropospheric trace gases such as CO, CH4, and H2O and reduced stratospheric O3 were measured in situ in the lowermost stratosphere over Northern Europe on 26 September 2012. The measurements indicate that these air masses differ from the stratospheric background. The calculation of 40 day backward trajectories with the trajectory module of the CLaMS model shows that these air masses are affected by the Asian monsoon anticyclone. Some air masses originate from the boundary layer in Southeast Asia/West Pacific and are rapidly lifted (1–2 days) within a typhoon. Afterwards they are injected directly into the anticyclonic circulation of the Asian monsoon. The subsequent long-range transport (8–14 days) of enhanced water vapour and pollutants to the lowermost stratosphere in Northern Europe is driven by eastward transport of tropospheric air from the Asian monsoon anticyclone caused by an eddy shedding event. We find that the combination of rapid uplift by a typhoon and eastward eddy shedding from the Asian monsoon anticyclone is an additional fast transport pathway that, for the case studied here, carries boundary emissions from Southeast Asia/West Pacific within approximately 5 weeks to the lowermost stratosphere in Northern Europe.",

            "abstract": "Lower Cretaceous strata of the Alaska North Slope contain the world’s most voluminous (1.2 million km3), highest relief (>1 km thick), and longest (600 km west-east) foreland clinoform depositional sequence. Although the regional stratigraphic framework of the Torok-Nanushuk clinoform sequence is well known, absolute age constraints are lacking. Existing, relatively imprecise “Aptian-Albian” biostratigraphy has hindered a quantitative understanding of clinoform depositional processes. We establish chronostratigraphy for the Torok-Nanushuk clinoform sequence with detrital zircon U/Pb geochronology from 9 localities from exploration well cores and outcrop samples (n=1666 grains). Maximum depositional ages defined by young detrital zircon U/Pb age populations, likely derived from coeval volcanism in Russian Chukotka, become progressively younger in the direction of eastward progradation. These data reveal a major progradational surge between 116 and 104 Ma when the shelf margin prograded more than 525 km. The rapid progradation (~45 km/m.y.) and sediment flux (~100,000 km3/m.y.) of this high-relief clinoform deposystem was sustained for 12 m.y. and suggests a supply-dominated system. This deposystem filled relict Colville basin accommodation that had developed as a flexural response to earlier Brooks Range tectonic loading. Clinoform dip directions and detrital zircon provenance indicate that the sediment was derived primarily from Russian Chukotka during longitudinal, eastward sediment dispersal. Progradation slowed after 104 Ma when seismic stratigraphy shows a shift from progradational to aggradational shelf-margin trajectories. The shelf margin prograded only another 60 km eastward before a sequence-bounding retrogradation occurred at 96 Ma. Our chronostratigraphy quantifies that rates of progradation and sediment flux were three times greater than previously believed during the major phase of basin filling. These rates are among the highest in the world for a clinoform deposystem in a foreland basin. This system is unique in that nowhere else are such high rates sustained for this long a duration (12 m.y.) or this high of relief (>1 km).",

            "abstract": "Large amplitude Alfven waves are ubiquitously observed in solar wind plasmas. Mjolhus(JPP, 1976) and Mio et al(JPSJ, 1976) found that nonlinear evolution of the uni-directional, parallel propagating Alfven waves can be described by the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLS). Later, the multi-dimensional extension (Mjolhus and Wyller, JPP, 1988; Passot and Sulem, POP, 1993; Gazol et al, POP, 1999) and ion kinetic modification (Mjolhus and Wyller, JPP, 1988; Spangler, POP, 1989; Medvedev and Diamond, POP, 1996; Nariyuki et al, POP, 2013) of DNLS have been reported. Recently, Nariyuki derived multi-dimensional DNLS from an expanding box model of the Hall-MHD system (Nariyuki, submitted). The set of equations including the nonlinear evolution of compressional wave modes (TDNLS) was derived by Hada(GRL, 1993). DNLS can be derived from TDNLS by rescaling of the variables (Mjolhus, Phys. Scr., 2006). Nariyuki and Hada(JPSJ, 2007) derived a kinetically modified TDNLS by using a simple Landau closure (Hammet and Perkins, PRL, 1990; Medvedev and Diamond, POP, 1996). In the present study, we revisit the ion kinetic modification of multi-dimensional TDNLS through more rigorous derivations, which is consistent with the past kinetic modification of DNLS. Although the original TDNLS was derived in the multi-dimensional form, the evolution of waves with finite propagation angles in TDNLS has not been paid much attention. Applicability of the resultant models to solar wind turbulence is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Mars is a dry planet, with actively blowing sand in many regions. In the absence of stable liquid water and an active hydrosphere, rates of chemical weathering are slow, such that aeolian abrasion is a dominant agent of landscape modification where sand is present and winds above threshold occur at sufficient frequency. Reflecting this activity, ventifacts, rocks that have been abraded by windborne particles, and wind-eroded outcrops, are common. They provide invaluable markers of the Martian wind record and insight into climate and landscape modification.\nVentifacts are distributed along the traverse of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. They contain one or more diagnostic features and textures: Facets, keels, basal sills, elongated pits, scallops/flutes, grooves, rock tails, and lineations. Keels at the junction of facets are sharp enough to pose a hazard MSL’s wheels in some areas. Geomorphic and textural patterns on outcrops indicate retreat of windward faces. Moonlight Valley and other depressions are demarcated by undercut walls and scree boulders, with the valley interiors containing fewer rocks, most of which show evidence for significant abrasion. Together, this suggests widening and undercutting of the valley walls, and erosion of interior rocks, by windblown sand.\nHiRISE images do not show any dark sand dunes in the traverse so far, in contrast to the large dune field to the south that is migrating up to 2 m per year. In addition, ChemCam shows that the rock Bathurst has a rind rich in mobile elements that would be removed in an abrading environment. This indicates that rock abrasion was likely more dominant in the past, a hypothesis consistent with rapid scarp retreat as suggested by the cosmogenic noble gases in Yellowknife Bay. Ventifacts and evidence for bedrock abrasion have also been found at the Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity sites, areas, like the Curiosity traverse so far, that lack evidence for current high sand fluxes. Yardangs are also common on the planet, regardless of whether local sand is mobile. This suggest that abrasion on Mars is an episodic process driven by the passage of sand in which rock retreat rates, based on fluxes of current active dunes, may reach 10s of microns per year. Such a process has acted, over long time scales, to imprint upon the surface a record of sand activity.",

            "abstract": "Asian dust is a well-known spring season phenomenon originating from arid or semiarid highlands in northern China and Mongolia. Many previous studies suggested that the occurrence and transport of Asian dust (i.e. dust activity) are closely related to variations in large-scale climate variables and local to regional climate conditions, and demonstrated the physical and dynamic mechanisms behind these relationships. However, the physical mechanism involved in the link between wintertime climate variability and spring dust activity was not fully explored. In this work, we analyzed the impacts of the wintertime Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on spring dust activity over northern China. After an extensive analysis for the effect of wintertime AO, we observed colder surface temperatures, stronger weather fluctuations, and frequent cold surges over northern China during the negative phase of AO, and thus found that AO can affect spring dust activity with time-lagged consistency. While there are many similarities between AO and NAO, on the other hand, previous studies suggested that they are significantly different in both their dynamical interpretation such as zonal-mean structure, and their spatial and temporal variability. In this study, AO is positively correlated with NAO with the correlation coefficient of +0.51, for the winter seasons of 1953-2007. In spite of high correlation with in-phase combinations, the enhancement of spring dust activity during the negative phase of NAO is higher than that during the negative phase of AO. Based on the superiority in dust activity, the possible differences in physical mechanism between AO and NAO will also be discussed.",

Materials were field tested during two summer workshops for educators and support was provided during the subsequent school years. Participants reported that the materials filled existing voids in their instructional materials, that they preferred to select individual exercises for use in their classrooms rather than the module as a whole, and that they found online tools in geosciences and connections to local field sites and geoscience professionals to be particularly valuable. Furthermore, while the five exercises where developed for use together in high school classrooms, individual exercises were found to be applicable in classrooms from the elementary through graduate levels.

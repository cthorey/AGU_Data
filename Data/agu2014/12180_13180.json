            "abstract": "During megathrust earthquakes, great ruptures are accompanied by large scale mass redistribution inside the solid Earth and by ocean mass redistribution due to bathymetry changes. These large scale mass displacements can be detected using the monthly gravity maps of the GRACE satellite mission. In recent years it has become increasingly common to use the long wavelength changes in the Earth's gravity field observed by GRACE to infer seismic source properties for large megathrust earthquakes, such as the Mw ~ 9 2004 Sumatra-Andaman, 2010 Maule (Chile) and 2011 Tohoku-Oki (Japan) events. In Broerse et al. (2011) we examined the effect of the presence of an ocean above the rupture on long wavelength gravity changes and showed it to be of the first order.\nHere we revisit the implementation of an ocean layer through the sea level equation and compare the results with approximated methods that have been used in the literature.\nOne of the simplifications usually lies in the assumption of a globally uniform ocean layer. We show that especially in the case of the 2010 Maule earthquake, due to the closeness of the South American continent, the uniform ocean assumption causes errors up to 57% for modeled peak geoid height changes (expressed at a spherical harmonic truncation degree of 40). In addition, we show that when a large amount of slip occurs close to the trench, horizontal motions of the ocean floor play a mayor role in the ocean contribution to gravity changes. Using a slip model of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake that places the majority of slip close to the surface, the peak value in geoid height change increases by 50% due to horizontal ocean floor motion.\nWhen GRACE observations are used to determine earthquake parameters such as seismic moment or source depth, the uniform ocean layer method introduces large biases, depending on the location of the rupture with respect to the continent. The same holds for interpreting shallow slip when horizontal motions are not properly accounted for in the ocean contribution. In both cases the depth at which slip occurs will be underestimated.",

            "abstract": "Recent megathrust earthquakes that occurred in Chile (2010) and Japan (2011) revealed a segmentation with depth of the megathrust interface: short period radiations were emitted from the deeper portion of the seismogenic zone (35-55km depth), while large coseismic slip, associated with little short period radiation and responsible for the tsunami generation, occurred on the shallower part of the subduction interface.\nOn April 1, 2014, a Mw 8.2 earthquake occurred close to the city of Pisagua in the central part of the seismic gap of southern Peru - northern Chile. This earthquake occurred in a densely instrumented area in a joint effort between Chilean, French, German and USA institutions. It is therefore an excellent case study to better understand the seismic rupture process on the subduction seismogenic interface. The availability of collocated cGPS and strong motion data (IPOC network: Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile) offers a unique opportunity to study the seismic source, compare the results derived from both type of data and study the variability of the seismic source with the frequency.\nWe perform a detailed comparison of the co-seismic movements registered by cGPS and three-component accelerograms. Then, we carry out a series of inversions to study the kinematic rupture associated with this earthquake. For this purpose, we use the accelerometer (9 stations) and high-frequency GPS (1 Hz, 13 stations) independently and jointly. We use a two-step inversion method proposed by Hernandez et al. (1999), where we use the contribution of GPS in obtaining the static displacement and then carry out the kinematic inversion using the method in frequency domain (Cotton & Campillo, 1995). Finally we study the dependency of the Mw8.2 Pisagua seismic source with the signal frequency. Data are filtered in different frequency bands and then frequency dependent inversions are conducted to explore the segmentation of the seismogenic zone in the area affected by the earthquake. In particular, we aim at testing whether a Mw8.2 earthquake can show a frequency dependency similar to the one observed for megathrust events, characterize this dependency and define segmentation along depth and along strike of the seismogenic zone, compare this segmentation with the one issued from GPS-derived interseismic coupling maps.",

            "abstract": "Despite 43 years of spacecraft observations (Duxbury et al., 2014), Phobos origin is still a matter of great debate within the scientific community. Two main scenarios have been presented in the last decades: the in situ formation and the asteroidal capture origin. Both approaches present pros and cons that do not uniquely demonstrate the debated moon’s origin; above that, Schmedemann et al. (2014) suggest that Phobos has an ancient cratering surface age of about 4.3-3.7 Ga, dating back to a period where the two proposed origins can be supported.\nWithin such context frame, the work we present suggests a new interpretation of Phobos multiple grooves, which may point at one of the two scenarios.\nPhobos parallel grooves have been debated since their first observation on Viking images in 1976 (Veverka and Duxbury, 1977). Multiple origins have been proposed for their formation i) as the result of Mars tidal stress (Dobrovolskis, 1982); ii) as fractures directly related to the formation of the 9 km Stickney crater (Fujiwara and Asada, 1983) or iii) a formation caused by rolling boulders coming from the Stickney impact crater (Wilson and Head, 1989). Another formation scenario is that the grooves are chains of secondary impacts resulting from primary impact events on Mars (Murray and Iliffe, 2011), but recently Ramsley and Head (2014) indicated that the volume of ejecta coming from Mars to Phobos is insufficient to produce the grooves as secondary craters.\nGrooves are common on asteroids, as presented in 951 Gaspra (Veverka et al., 1994), 243 Ida (Belton et al., 1994), 433 Eros (Thomas et al., (2002), Buczkowski et al., 2008), 21 Lutetia (Massironi et al., 2011), 4 Vesta (Buczkowski et al., 2012). In this work we will show the preliminary results of a novel approach on the analysis of the grooves distribution, suggesting they are the remnants of an ancient parent body from which the moon could have been originated providing important implications on the origin of Phobos.",

            "abstract": "Controls on the global distribution of surge-type glaciers hold the keys to a better understanding of surge mechanisms. Our study represents the first investigation of the correlations between the global distribution of surge-type glaciers and climatic and geometric variables, using a new geodatabase inventorying all surge-type glaciers in the world. The highest densities of surge-type glaciers occur within an optimal climatic envelope bounded by temperature and precipitation. Across all regions with both surge-type and normal glaciers, the former are larger, especially at the cold, dry end of the climatic spectrum. Climate change can also alter the distribution of surge-type glaciers. A species distribution model, Maxent, accurately depicts the major clusters of surge-type glaciers using three variables: temperature, precipitation and glacier area, but under-predicts clusters found outside of the climatically optimal surge zone. We interpret the results in terms of a new enthalpy cycle model. Steady states require a balance between enthalpy gains generated by the balance flux and losses via heat conduction and meltwater discharge. This condition can be most easily satisfied in cold, dry environments (thin, low-flux glaciers, efficient conductive heat losses), and warm, humid environments (high meltwater discharges). Intermediate conditions correspond with the optimal surge zone, where neither heat conduction nor runoff can effectively discharge heat gains, and enthalpy cycling can result.",

            "abstract": "The weather conditions from August 2011 to May 2012 produced an extreme drought in the eastern Czech Republic (Moravia), whereas the patterns were nearly normal in its western region (Bohemia). The Southern and Central Moravia regions, which represent the most important agricultural areas, were most affected by the drought. The precipitation totals for the studied period were 50% to 70% of the long-term mean, which was calculated for 1961–2000. In autumn 2011, the total precipitation accounted for 10% to 30% of the long-term mean for most of Moravia, increasing to 30% to 50% in spring 2012. Moreover, 7.5% of the Czech Republic experienced a 100-year drought; 20% of the country experienced a 20-year drought. According to the Palmer Drought Severity Index, the 2012 drought was classified as the worst in the past 130 years. The drought patterns were related to the prevailing high-pressure systems over Central Europe and the occurrence of weather types with different precipitation amounts in Bohemia and Moravia. The most substantial drought effects occurred in the agricultural sector. A decrease in cereal yields was observed in the analyzed production areas in Moravia, which was unprecedented in the past 52 years. Moreover, winter crops were affected more than spring crops. An increased risk of fire occurred due to the drought conditions; the largest forest fire in the past 15 years was recorded during this period. Furthermore, signs of hydrological drought were also reported in rivers. The 2011–2012 drought was compared with the significant droughts in 2000, 2003 and 2007. Austria and Slovakia, which neighbor the Czech Republic, experienced a similar drought. This drought analysis can be used as a scenario for future droughts and their impacts in Central Europe due to the global warming projected by GCMs.\nAcknowledgements:\nThis study was made possible by the generous support of the “Establishment of International Scientific Team Focused on Drought Research” project (no.

            "abstract": "Subduction and roll-back of narrow slabs is common in the Mediterranean region and is necessarily accompanied by a lithospheric scale slab edge tear fault or “STEP” (Subduction Transform Edge Propagator). We report on two recent marine geophysical surveys conducted in the Ionian Sea, offshore Eastern Sicily to investigate this type of structure: CIRCEE October 2013 R/V Le Suroit and DIONYSUS October 2014 R/V Meteor. The aim of the CIRCEE survey was to map potentially seismogenic faults offshore eastern Sicily and to seek the surface expression of the STEP fault (through high-resolution 72-channel seismic reflection profiles and swath mapping bathymetry). Strong historical earthquakes have struck this region repeatedly, whose origin in some cases remains unknown (1169, 1542, 1693).\nTwo major crustal scale structures have been proposed as being related to the STEP: the Malta escarpment, and a combined normal-fault and strike-slip-fault system 20-50 km further east, striking roughly N50°W and well imaged by the CIRCEE data. The main objectives of the DIONYSUS deep seismic survey in autumn 2014 are to image the deep structure (crustal thickness, nature of the crust) of this ancient Tethyan age margin (likely a transform margin) and to seek deeper expressions of reactivation (lithospheric scale faulting) related to the slab tear. The internal geometry of the Calabrian subduction zone - the crystalline basement backstop, the slab dip, the accretionary wedge composition (detritic vs. evaporitic) and its thickness, is also a target of the deep seismic survey. To achieve these goals a German-French-Italian wide-angle seismic survey was performed in October 2014 using 60 OBS (30 from Kiel-Geomar and 30 from Ifremer/Univ. Brest) deployed along 4 long profiles, 3 of which are collocated along existing multi-channel seismic lines (Italian CROP profiles) depth processed at Geomar.",

            "abstract": "Absolute ages for planetary surfaces are often inferred by crater densities, and are only indirectly constrained by ages of meteorites. Cratering chronology models are calibrated based on lunar samples, and are transferred towards other planets using crater scaling laws and cratering rate ratios. This transfer often relies on extrapolations. We have shown that the <5 Myrs old and 55-km wide Mojave Crater is the ejection source for the meteorites classified as shergottites [1], and thus allows the calibration of the chronology model of Mars. Shergottites and this crater are linked by their coinciding meteorite ejection ages and the crater formation age, and mineralogical constraints [1]. Thus, the cratering-based age determination method for Mars is now calibrated.\nOur new Martian cratering chronology model is tested against the in situ determined radiometric and exposure ages for a mudstone in Gale crater [3], and the ages found with both methods are identical. Because Mojave formed on 4.3 Gyrs old terrain, the original crystallization ages of shergottites are old, as inferred by Pb-Pb isotope ratios [4-6], and the much-quoted <600 Myrs shergottite ages [e.g., 7] are due to resetting. Martian surface features dated with cratering statistics shifts the absolute age of the oldest terrains of Mars backwards by 200 Myrs.\n",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the timing and magnitude of vertical crustal motions is key to understanding the impact of tectonic uplift on changes in atmospheric circulation, rainfall, and environmental conditions. Uplift of the East African Plateau (EAP) of Kenya has been linked to mantle processes, but paleoaltimetry data are still too scarce to unambiguously constrain plateau evolution and subsequent vertical motions associated with late Cenozoic rifting. Here we assess the fossil remains of a beaked whale (Ziphiidae) from the Turkana region of Kenya, 700 km inland from the present-day coastline of the Indian Ocean. The whale fossil was found at an elevation of 650 m and helps constraining the uplift of the northeastern flanks of the EAP. The Kenyan ziphiid was discovered in fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the extensional Oligo-Miocene Lokichar basin (Mead, 1975) along with terrestrial mammals and freshwater mollusks below a basalt dated at 17.1 ± 1.0 Ma (Boschetto et al., 1992). The unifying characteristics of riverine occurrences of modern marine mammals include sufficient discharge in low-gradient rivers to maintain pathways deep enough to facilitate migration, and the absence of shallow bedrock, rapids and waterfalls. The most likely route, which may have had these characteristics is a fluvial corridor controlled by thermal subsidence of the Cretaceous Anza Rift, which once linked extensional processes in Central and East Africa with the continental margin. The fossil locality and analogies with present-day occurrences of marine mammals in terrestrial realms suggest that the ziphiid stranded slightly above sea level. In combination with 13.5. Ma phonolite flows that utilized eastward-directed drainages away from the EAP the fossil find thus provides the older of only two empirical paleoelevation points that constrain the onset of uplift of the EAP to the interval between approximately 17 and 13 Ma. Topographic uplift of the EAP induced paleoclimatic change from a low-elevation humid environment to highly variable, much drier conditions, which altered biotic communities and drove evolution in East Africa, including that of primates.",

The growing number of projects related to enhanced geothermal systems, fracking and others has led to the question, which maximum earthquake magnitude can be expected as a consequence of fluid injection. This question is addressed from the perspective of statistical analysis. Using basic empirical laws of earthquake statistics, we estimate the magnitude MT of the maximum expected earthquake in a pre-defined future time window T. A case study of the fluid injection site at Paradox Valley, Colorado, USA, demonstrates that the magnitude m=4.3 of the largest observed earthquake on 27 May 2000 is lying very well within the expectation from past seismicity without adjusting any parameters. Vice versa, for a given maximum tolerable earthquake at an injection site, we can constrain the corresponding amount of injected fluids that must not be exceeded within pre-defined confidence bounds.",

            "abstract": "In high-elevation watersheds of the Himalayan region the correct representation of the internal states and process dynamics in glacio-hydrological models can often not be verified due to missing in-situ measurements. The aim of this study is to provide a fundamental understanding of the hydrology of a Himalayan watershed through the systematic integration of in-situ data in a glacio-hydrological model. We use ground data from the upper Langtang valley in Nepal combined with high resolution satellite data to understand specific processes and test the application of new model components specifically developed. We apply a new model for ablation under debris that takes into account the varying effect of debris thickness on melt rates. A novel approach is tested to reconstruct spatial fields of debris thickness through combination of energy balance modelling, UAV-derived geodetic mass balance and statistical techniques. The systematic integration of in-situ data for model calibration enables the application of a state-of-the art model with many parameters to model glacier evolution and catchment runoff in spite of the lack of continuous long-term historical records. It allows drawing conclusions on the importance of processes that have been suggested as being relevant but never quantified before. The simulations show that 8.7% of total water inputs originate from sub-debris ice melt. 4.5% originate from melted avalanched snow. These components can be locally much more important, since the spatial variability of processes within the valley is high.\nThe model is then used to simulate the response of the catchment to climate change. We show that climate warming leads to an increase in future icemelt and a peak in glacier runoff by mid-century. The increase in total icemelt is due to higher melt rates and large areas that are currently located above the equilibrium line altitude additionally that will contribute to melt. Catchment runoff will not reach below current levels throughout the 21st century due to precipitation increases. Debris covered glacier area will disappear at a slower pace than non-debris covered area. Still, due to the relative climate insensitivity of melt rates below thick debris, the contribution of sub-debris icemelt to runoff will not exceed 10% at all times.",

To understand the role of rivers in the global carbon cycle, the roles of chemical weathering and CO2 release from major rivers must be studied. We investigated three major Himalayan rivers in Bangladesh: the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. Although pCO2 is known to be low in the upper reaches of these rivers owing to active chemical weathering, we observed pCO2 values higher than the atmospheric pCO2 along their lower reaches, where deep soils have developed and where high air temperatures promote active soil respiration. By a simple mixing calculation, we found that seasonal variations of the river water carbonate system are controlled by subsurface water flows. In the rainy season, most of the lowlands are inundated and the contribution of subsurface flow to the river system increases. As a result, the CO2 flux to the atmosphere becomes higher. In future work, more detailed spatial and seasonal investigations are required to clarify the role of rivers in the global carbon cycle and how that role will change under global warming.",

            "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms that modify landscapes is essential for risk assessment in tropical islands. Because measurements of erosion rates are critical for understanding landform evolution, the use of cosmogenic isotopes in river sediments and the use of river load geochemistry have grown rapidly in recent years.\nIn this study we aim to estimate erosion rate of an highly eroded drainage area of the Réunion Island and we compare 3 methods of measurment : i) from cosmogenic 3He concentrations [3Hec], ii) from river geochemistry and iii) from landforms reconstruction in order to estimate chemical weathering, mechanical erosion, and to understand the message provided by each method.\nThe basin under invistagation is the Rivière Langevin Canyon, located on the south flank of the Piton de la Fournaise Volcano (PdF). Helium concentrations and isotopic ratios have been measured in olivine rich sands from the Langevin river. [3Hec] have been calculated using: (i) the 3He/4He ratio measured by crushing and (ii) the 3He and 4He concentrations measured by melting the resulting powder. Digital elevation model derivatives and K-Ar geochronological data have been used to reconstruct the PdF morphology and calculate the volume of material eroded over the past 65Ka. Finally, dissolved and suspended loads in Langevin river will be analysed for their major and trace elements contents in order to characterise both chemical and mechanical erosion products. A soil will also be analysed in order to estimate the chemical weathering of the bedrock and to understand soil formation in the studied basin. Initial results indicate 3Hec average erosion rates of 4.9±11.6 mm/yr and 4.7±0.1 mm/yr from PdF morphology reconstruction. Cosmogenic and landform reconstruction results show a reasonable agreement. However, the lack of olivine in the sampled soil rises the question of river sediment olivine sources. Such olivine need to be delivered either by deep-seated catastrophic events either from no-soil sources. In this context, 3Hec in olivine rich sands can be used as a tool for mechanical erosion estimates. Comparison with river geochemistry results in the Langevin river will help understand the coopling between chemical weathering and mechanical erosion and will confirm if olivine can be used as a proxy for mechanical erosion estimation.",

            "abstract": "Cloud detection during nighttime poses a real problem to researchers because of a lack of optimum sensors that can specifically detect clouds during this time of the day. Hence, lidars and satellites are currently some of the instruments that are being utilized to determine cloud presence in the atmosphere. These clouds play a significant role in the night weather system for the reason that they serve as barriers of thermal radiation from the Earth and thereby reflecting this radiation back to the Earth. This effectively lowers the rate of decreasing temperature in the atmosphere at night. The objective of this study is to detect cloud occurrences at nighttime for the purpose of studying patterns of cloud occurrence and the effects of clouds on local weather. In this study, a commercial camera (Canon Powershot A2300) is operated continuously to capture nighttime clouds. The camera is situated inside a weather-proof box with a glass cover and is placed on the rooftop of the Manila Observatory building to gather pictures of the sky every 5min to observe cloud dynamics and evolution in the atmosphere. To detect pixels with clouds, the pictures are converted from its native JPEG to grayscale format. The pixels are then screened for clouds by looking at the values of pixels with and without clouds. In grayscale format, pixels with clouds have greater pixel values than pixels without clouds. Based on the observations, 0.34 of the maximum pixel value is enough to discern pixels with clouds from pixels without clouds. Figs. 1a & 1b are sample unprocessed pictures of cloudless night (May 22-23, 2014) and cloudy skies (May 23-24, 2014), respectively. Figs.1c and 1d show percentage of occurrence of nighttime clouds on May 22-23 and May 23-24, 2014, respectively. The cloud occurrence in a pixel is defined as the ratio of the number times when the pixel has clouds to the total number of observations. Fig. 1c shows less than 50% cloud occurrence while Fig. 1d shows cloud occurrence more than what is shown in Fig. 1c. These graphs show the capability of the camera to detect and measure the cloud occurrence at nighttime. Continuous collection of nighttime pictures is currently implemented. In regions where there is a dearth of scientific data, the measured nighttime cloud occurrence will serve as a baseline for future cloud studies in this part of the world.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty is an inherent feature of most scientific endeavours, and many political decisions must be made in the presence of scientific uncertainty. In the case of climate change, there is evidence that greater scientific uncertainty increases the risk associated with the impact of climate change. Scientific uncertainty thus provides an impetus for cutting emissions rather than delaying action. In contrast to those normative considerations, uncertainty is frequently cited in political and public discourse as a reason to delay mitigation. We examine ways in which this gap between public and scientific understanding of uncertainty can be bridged.\nIn particular, we sought ways to communicate uncertainty in a way that better calibrates people’s risk perceptions with the projected impact of climate change. We report two behavioural experiments in which uncertainty about the future was expressed either as outcome uncertainty or temporal uncertainty. The conventional presentation of uncertainty involves uncertainty about an outcome at a given time—for example, the range of possible sea level rise (say 50cm +/- 20cm) by a certain date. An alternative presentation of the same situation presents a certain outcome (“sea levels will rise by 50cm”) but places the uncertainty into the time of arrival (“this may occur as early as 2040 or as late as 2080”).\nWe presented participants with a series of statements and graphs indicating projected increases in temperature, sea levels, ocean acidification, and a decrease in artic sea ice. In the uncertain magnitude condition, the statements and graphs reported the upper and lower confidence bounds of the projected magnitude and the mean projected time of arrival. In the uncertain time of arrival condition, they reported the upper and lower confidence bounds of the projected time of arrival and the mean projected magnitude.\nThe results show that when uncertainty was presented as uncertain time of arrival rather than an uncertain outcome, people expressed greater concern about the projected outcomes. In a further experiment involving repeated “games” with a simulated economy, we similarly showed that people allocate more resources to mitigation if there is uncertainty about the timing of an adverse event rather than about the magnitude of its impact.",

            "abstract": "The plasmaspheric virtual resonance model has been proposed as one of the source mechanisms for low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. Few studies have used simultaneous multipoint observations in space to examine the spatial structure of Pi2 pulsations both inside and outside the plasmasphere. In this study we show multipoint observations for Pi2 pulsations using the Van Allen Probes (RBSP-A and RBSP-B). We focus on the two events that occurred between 1700 and 2000 UT on March 12, 2013, which were simultaneously observed by Van Allen Probes and Bohyun (BOH, L = 1.35) station in South Korea. By using plasma density measurements, we determined that during this time RBSP-A was located outside the plasmasphere and RBSP-B was located inside it. We found that the poloidal, radial (δBx) and compressional (δBz), magnetic field components, and the azimuthal (Ey) electric field component observed by both RBSP-A and RBSP-B have a high correlation with the H component at BOH for both events. The δBx and δBz oscillations at both RBSP-A and RBSP-B are nearly out of phase with ground Pi2. The Ey -H cross phases at RBSP-A outside the plasmapause and RBSP-B inside the plasmapause are nearly in quadrature for the first Pi2 event. These observations indicate that the Pi2 pulsations exist outside the plasmasphere with a radially standing signature which supports the plasmaspheric virtual resonance model.",

Late Holocene glacier marginal fluctuations are known from earlier studies, and older, well preserved moraine ridges and glacial landforms have also been mapped and described. Presently, outlet glaciers drain into the valleys Leirufjörður and Reykjarfjörður at the northwest and east side of the ice-cap, respectively. Samples for cosmogenic exposure dating (36Cl) were collected from erratics and striated bedrock in order to date the last deglaciation and to determine ages of terminal moraines.\nPreliminary results suggest that the valleys were still glaciated during the early Holocene. Lateral and terminal moraines at the mouth of Leirufjörður were dated to 9-10 kyr BP, indicating the main outlets of the ice-cap were calving glaciers at that time. Erratics dated to 20-37 kyr BP indicate that at least some coastal capes and plateaux were ice-free much earlier. However, erratics from similar elevations, 300-500 m a.s.l., but located more proximal to the ice cap have average exposure ages about 10 kyr. The 20-37 kyr old erratics could also be older rocks preserved under less active or even cold based ice.",

            "abstract": "Laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments were performed at pressures from ~ 30 to 125 GPa on bulk compositions in the system MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O (MASH) to constrain the stability of hydrous phases in Earth’s lower mantle. Phase identification in run products by synchrotron powder diffraction reveals a consistent set of stability relations for the high-pressure, dense hydrous silicate phases D and H. Experiments show that aluminous phase D is stable to ~ 55 GPa. Aluminous phase H becomes stable at ~ 40 GPa and remains stable to higher pressures throughout the lower mantle depth range in both model peridotitic and basaltic lithologies. Preliminary FEG-probe analyses indicate that Phase H is alumina-rich at ~ 50 GPa, with only 5 to 10 wt% each of MgO and SiO2. Variations in ambient unit cell volumes show that Mg-perovskite becomes more aluminous with pressure throughout the pressure range studied, and that Phase H may become more Mg- and Si-rich with pressure. We also find that at pressures above ~ 90 GPa stishovite is replaced in Si-rich compositions by seifertite, at which point there is a corresponding increase in the Al-content of phase H. The melting curves of MASH compositions have been determined using thermal perturbations in power versus temperature curves, and are observed to be shallow with dT/dP slopes of ~ 4K/GPa. Our results show that hydrated peridotitic or basaltic compositions in the lower mantle should be partially molten at all depths along an adiabatic mantle geotherm. Aluminous Phase H will be stable in colder, hydrated subducting slabs, potentially to the core-mantle boundary. Thus, aluminous phase H is the primary vessel for transport of hydrogen to the deepest mantle, but hydrous silicate melt will be the host of hydrogen at ambient mantle temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Ambient noise tomography has provided essential constraints on crustal and uppermost mantle shear velocity structure in global seismology. Recent studies demonstrate that high frequency (e.g., ~ 1 Hz) surface waves between receivers at short distances can be successfully retrieved from ambient noise cross-correlation and then be used for imaging near surface or shallow crustal shear velocity structures. This approach provides important information for strong ground motion prediction in seismically active area and overburden structure characterization in oil and gas fields. Here we propose a new tomographic method to invert all surface wave dispersion data for 3-D variations of shear wavespeed without the intermediate step of phase or group velocity maps.The method uses frequency-dependent propagation paths and a wavelet-based sparsity-constrained tomographic inversion. A fast marching method is used to compute, at each period, surface wave traveltimes and ray paths between sources and receivers. This avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media. The wavelet coefficients of the velocity model are estimated with an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, and upon iterations the surface wave ray paths and the data sensitivity matrix are updated from the newly obtained velocity model. We apply this new method to determine the 3-D near surface wavespeed variations in the Taipei basin of Taiwan, Hefei urban area and a shale and gas production field in China using the high-frequency interstation Rayleigh wave dispersion data extracted from ambient noisecross-correlation. The results reveal strong effects of off-great-circle propagation of high-frequency surface waves in these regions with above 30% shear wavespeed variations. The proposed approach is more efficient and robust than the traditional two-step surface wave tomography for imaging complex structures. In the future, approximate 3-D sensitivity kernels for dispersion data will be incorporated to account for finite-frequency effect of surface wave propagation. In addition, our approach provides a consistent framework for joint inversion of surface wave dispersion and body wave traveltime data for 3-D Vp and Vs structures.",

We study gas phase trapping during imbibition for capillary number from 2×10-7 to 10-6 by X-ray computer tomography (μ-CT) and compare the experimental results with predictions from percolation theory. We found excellent agreement. Percolation theory could explain (i) that the capillary desaturation curves are not dependent on flow rate, (ii) the linear dependence of the total gas surface on gas saturation that is a direct consequence of the linear relationship between cluster surface and cluster volume, which is a prediction from percolation theory for large finite clusters, (iii) the power-like cluster size distribution with an exponent τexp = 2.15 that only deviates by 2% from the theoretical one (τtheor = 2.19), and (iv) that the maximal z-extension of trapped large gas cluster is described by the cut-off correlation length ξB (B – bond number).\nIn order to support the findings from μ-CT-experiments and to study the dynamics of capillary trapping, we conduct visualization experiments using monolayer- and microstructure-models.\nThe Figure shows the residual trapped air (red colored) after water imbibition: left: 2D-cut through a 3D-reconstructed image, right: 3D-slice of a 3D-reconstructed image.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 15 years, global mean surface temperatures exhibit only a weak trend - widely referred to as a hiatus - compared to the preceding 25-year period. Recent studies have attempted to attribute the hiatus to several causes, e.g., ocean-atmosphere energy exchange mechanisms, stratospheric water vapour, and impacts of volcanic emissions unaccounted for. Recently, the phenomenon has also been analysed in terms of incomplete sampling of the rapidly warming Arctic region.\nWe here examine zonal mean temperature trends in satellite-based tropospheric data sets with a global coverage, and compare them to the HadCRUT4 surface data set. MSU/AMSU data allow us to study tropospheric temperature trend patterns in the pre-hiatus period 1985--1997 relative to the hiatus period 2001--2013. The latter period is also covered by GNSS Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements from which geopotential heights of isobaric surfaces, and hence mean tropospheric temperatures, can be derived. Omission of successively larger polar regions from the global-mean temperature calculations, in both tropospheric and surface data sets, shows that data gaps at high latitudes can not explain the observed differences between the hiatus and the pre-hiatus period. Leaving out high latitudes leads to an under-estimation of the trend in the global means, but this effect is only a minor contributor to the hiatus phenomenon.Instead, the dominating causes appears to be found at low- and mid-latitudes.",

            "abstract": "There is a clear role for climate science in supporting decision making at a range of scales and in a range of contexts: from Global to local, from Policy to Industry. However, clear a role climate science can play, there is also a clear discrepancy in the understanding of how to use the science and associated tools (such as climate models). Despite there being a large body of literature on the science there is clearly a need to provide greater support in how to apply appropriately. However, access to high quality professional development courses can be problematic, due to geographic, financial and time constraints. In attempt to address this gap we independently developed two online professional courses that focused on helping participants use and apply two regional climate models, WRF and PRECIS.\nBoth courses were designed to support participants’ learning through tutor led programs that covered the basic climate scientific principles of regional climate modeling and how to apply model outputs. The fundamental differences between the two courses are: 1) the WRF modeling course expected participants to design their own research question that was then run on a version of the model, whereas 2) the PRECIS course concentrated on the principles of regional modeling and how the climate science informed the modeling process.\nThe two courses were developed to utilise the cost and time management benefits associated with eLearning, with the recognition that this mode of teaching can also be accessed internationally, providing professional development courses in countries that may not be able to provide their own. The development teams saw it as critical that the courses reflected sound educational theory, to ensure that participants had the maximum opportunity to learn successfully. In particular, the role of reflection is central to both course structures to help participants make sense of the science in relation to their own situation.\n\nThis paper details the different structures of both courses, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each, along with the educational approaches used. We conclude by proposing a framework for the develop of educationally robust online professional development programs that actively supports decision makers in understanding, developing and applying regional climate models.",

            "abstract": "Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) has been proposed as a mean to mitigate climate change and ocean acidification. Whilst the mitigation potential of this geo-engineering technology may sound promising, it poses environmental risks. Within the Priority Program “Climate Engineering” of the German Science Foundation (DFG), we investigate the mitigation potential of AOA to reduce atmospheric CO2 and counteract the consequences of ocean acidification. We are particularly interested in the residence time of the added alkalinity at the ocean surface because it must stay in the upper ocean in order to increase the oceanic CO2 uptake. The mitigation potential, risks and the unintended consequences of this geo-engineering method are also exhaustively studied. These questions are tackled through the analysis of different alkalinity enhancement scenarios in the state-of-the-art Earth system model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-ESM) in a configuration based on the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Model scenarios are designed so that AOA is performed to keep the atmospheric CO2 concentrations similar to values of the stabilization scenario RCP4.5, while fossil fuel CO2 emissions follow the pathway of the high-CO2 scenario RCP8.5. Alkalinity is added globally into the upper 12 meters of the ocean in different seasons and years. We found that on the time scale of relevance (i.e. from years to decades), season and location are key aspects to take into account in the implementation of AOA. This is because of inhomogeneous vertical mixing of added alkalinity due to the mixed layer depth which is established by the season. We also show that the rate of addition greatly determines impact and outcome of this geo-engineering method. Changes driven by the implementation of this method in the ocean biogeochemistry are also discussed. For instance, the associated changes in the carbon cycle, marine oxygen levels, saturation state of carbonate minerals, nutrient cycles and marine biota.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in in-situ U-Th/Pb monazite petrochronology allow ages obtained from micron-scale portions of texturally-constrained, individual crystals to be placed directly into a quantitative Pressure-Temperature framework.\nHowever, there remain major unresolved challenges in linking monazite ages to specific deformation events and discerning the effects of deformation on the isotopic and elemental tracers in these phases. Few studies have quantitatively investigated monazite microstructure, and these studies have largely focused only on crystals produced experimentally (e.g. Reddy et al., 2010). The dispersion in age data commonly yielded from monazite U-Th/Pb datasets suggest that monazite dynamically recrystallises during deformation. It remains unclear how this continual recrystallisation is reflected in the monazite crystal structure, and how this subsequently impacts the ages (or age ranges) yielded from single crystals.\nHere, combined laser ablation split-stream analysis of deformed monazite, EBSD imaging and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) phase equilibria modelling is used to quantify the influence of deformation on monazite (re)crystallisation mechanisms and its subsequent effect on the crystallographic structure, ages and trace-element distribution in individual grains. These data provide links between ages and specific deformation events, thus helping further our understanding of the role of dynamic recrystallisation in producing age variation within and between crystals in a deformed rock. These data provide a new dimension to the field of petrochronology, demonstrating the importance of fully integrating the Pressure-Temperature-time-deformation history of accessory phases to better interpret the meaningfulness of ages yielded from deformed rocks.\nReddy, S. et al., 2010.

            "abstract": "Stratospheric ozone change can influence on tropospheric climate. For example, Sigmond and Fyfe (2010) pointed out the Antarctic sea ice could increase due to the Antarctic ozone hole: Stratospheric cooling due to the ozone hole increases a westerly anomaly of the polar night jet by satisfying the thermal wind balance, and annular mode response increases westerly anomaly near the surface. The increase of the surface westerly intensifies the northward component of the Ekman transport in the ocean and promotes the sea ice transport to lower latitudes. However, the impact of ozone change in paleoclimate has not been investigated in detail. In most of paleoclimate experiments of CMIP5/PMIP3, the distribution of ozone is fixed to the estimated value of 1850 AD despite the ozone distribution depends on the solar radiation distribution as a function of latitude and time (season). This treatment may cause some bias to the simulation results. In this study, therefore, we examine the impacts of forecasted ozone distribution in paleoclimate experiments with an Earth system model. In this presentation, we focus on the Antarctic region in the mid-Holocene (6k year before present, hereafter MH) experiment, where significant impact is obtained.\nWe utilize Japan Meteorological Agency Meteorological Research Institute (JMA-MRI) Earth system model, which is a coupled model of the atmosphere-ocean-aerosol general circulation model of MRI-CGCM3 (Yukimoto et al., 2012) which was used in CMIP5 and the chemistry model of MRI-CCM2 (Deushi and Shibata, 2011). We examine the MH experiment and the preindustrial control experiment under the condition of 1850 AD, both of which are corresponding to CMIP5.\nWe investigated the impact of the ozone variations to climate by the change of orbital parameters of the Earth. The Antarctic sea ice in spring decreases through the deceleration of the westerly jet due to the increase of stratospheric ozone. As a result, temperature anomaly is up to about 1 K near the surface. This result suggests that the ozone distribution consistent with the solar insolation in the targeted era should be used in paleoclimate simulations in order to improve the accuracy of the climate reconstruction in the polar regions.",

            "abstract": "Crucial to lava flow hazard assessment is the development of tools for real-time prediction of flow paths, flow advance rates, and final flow lengths. Accurate prediction of flow paths and advance rates requires not only rapid assessment of eruption conditions (especially effusion rate) but also improved models of lava flow emplacement. Here we present the LAV@HAZARD web-GIS framework, which combines spaceborne remote sensing techniques and numerical simulations for real-time forecasting of lava flow hazards. By using satellite-derived discharge rates to drive a lava flow emplacement model, LAV@HAZARD allows timely definition of parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the maximum run-out distance. We take advantage of the flexibility of the HOTSAT thermal monitoring system to process satellite images coming from sensors with different spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions. HOTSAT was designed to ingest infrared satellite data acquired by the MODIS and SEVIRI sensors to output hot spot location, lava thermal flux and discharge rate. We use LAV@HAZARD to merge this output with the MAGFLOW physics-based model to simulate lava flow paths and to update, in a timely manner, flow simulations. Thus, any significant changes in lava discharge rate are included in the predictions. A significant benefit in terms of computational speed was obtained thanks to the parallel implementation of MAGFLOW on graphic processing units (GPUs). All this useful information has been gathered into the LAV@HAZARD platform which, due to the high degree of interactivity, allows generation of easily readable maps and a fast way to explore alternative scenarios. We will describe and demonstrate the operation of this framework using a variety of case studies pertaining to Mt Etna, Sicily. Although this study was conducted on Mt Etna, the approach used is designed to be applicable to other volcanic areas around the world.",

            "abstract": "The weakening mechanism of calcite-bearing rocks is still poorly understood though many major earthquakes stroke within carbonate sequences. Insights derive from the laboratory: in experiments performed on calcite-bearing gouges, up to 90% drop in friction is associated to grain size reduction to the nanoscale and the formation of crystal-plastic microstructures suggesting the activation of debated weakening mechanisms (e.g., grain boundary sliding and diffusion creep; nanopowder lubrication). Whatever the case, it is unclear how nanoparticles form and what their role is at the initiation of sliding.\nTo investigate initial fault instability we sheared with a rotary shear apparatus SHIVA pre-cut ring-shaped solid cylinders (50/30 mm ext/int diameter) of Carrara marble (99.9% CaCO3). Rock cylinders were slid for few millimetres(0, 1.5 mm and 5mm) at accelerations (6.5 ms-2) and normal stresses (10 MPa) approaching seismic deformation conditions. Initial slip (<2 mm) was concomitant with large frictional weakening (up to 30% of static friction) and CO2emission.\nMicroanalytical observations (FE-SEM, FIB-SEM and TEM) showed that the experimental slipping zones consisted of (1) defects structures, including dislocations, cleavage surfaces and deformation features such as mechanical twins, partially burden beneath (2) a 2-10 micrometer thick layer of nanograins where pervasive nano-fracturing have occurred preserving the grain shape (pulverization) and (3) reaction products attributable to high pressure and high temperature conditions (i.e. calcite decomposition into amorphous carbon rimming the nanograins). All the above features are typical of shock-induced changes in minerals.\nWe interpret the above observations as follows: pre-existing grain boundaries or newly formed defects are the nuclei for the generation of dislocations and for their pile-up; the fast release of those piles-up in avalanches under rapid stress loading (fast moving dislocations) may explain the origin of such a shock-like behaviour responsible for large initial frictional weakening. The passage of the shock wave induces pervasive nanofracturing with grain size reduction to the nano-scale and an abrupt temperature rise responsible for calcite decarbonation and formation of carbon amorphous material.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we incorporated a groundwater exploitation scheme into the land surface model CLM3.5 to investigate the effects of the anthropogenic exploitation of groundwater on land surface processes in a river basin. Simulations of the Haihe River Basin in northern China were conducted for the years 1965–2000 using the model. A control simulation without exploitation and three exploitation simulations with different water demands derived from socioeconomic data related to the Basin were conducted. The results showed that groundwater exploitation for human activities resulted in increased wetting and cooling effects at the land surface and reduced groundwater storage. A lowering of the groundwater table, increased upper soil moisture, reduced 2 m air temperature, and enhanced latent heat flux were detected by the end of the simulated period, and the changes at the land surface were related linearly to the water demands. To determine the possible responses of the land surface processes in extreme cases (i.e., in which the exploitation process either continued or ceased), additional hypothetical simulations for the coming 200 years with constant climate forcing were conducted, regardless of changes in climate. The simulations revealed that the local groundwater storage on the plains could not contend with high-intensity exploitation for long if the exploitation process continues at the current rate. Changes attributable to groundwater exploitation reached extreme values and then weakened within decades with the depletion of groundwater resources and the exploitation process will therefore cease. However, if exploitation is stopped completely to allow groundwater to recover, drying and warming effects, such as increased temperature, reduced soil moisture, and reduced total runoff, would occur in the Basin within the early decades of the simulation period. The effects of exploitation will then gradually disappear, and the land surface variables will approach the natural state and stabilize at different rates. Simulations were also conducted for cases in which exploitation either continues or ceases using future climate scenario outputs from a general circulation model. The resulting trends were almost the same as those of the simulations with constant climate forcing.",

            "abstract": "Roman aqueducts belong to the greatest engineering structures of the ancient world. Recently, carbonate deposits in the remains of aqueduct bridges and channels were recognized as a new proxy for palaeo-environmental changes. These deposits show similar fabric and lamination characteristics as other types of terrestrial carbonates from caves and rivers such as freshwater tufa, and hot spring deposits like travertine.\nWe present a multi-disciplinary study on calcium carbonate deposits from aqueduct sites in Southern France and Turkey, assisted by monitoring studies at aqueduct water sources in Italy of water composition and recent carbonate growth. The microstructure of the deposits shows considerable variation, even along a single aqueduct, mainly due to different climatic regimes, variations in channel type, aqueduct gradient and water velocity. However, downstream samples of several aqueducts show regular laminations associated with a strong δ18O cyclicity that can be interpreted as an effect of seasonal warming and cooling of water in the aqueduct channel. δ13C isotope curves are more complicated but commonly show antithetic cyclicity to δ18O. Deposits from aqueducts in the eastern Mediterranean, at Aspendos and Patara (Southern Turkey), typically show a regular layering of alternating sparite and micrite, which coincides with δ18O cyclicity. This reflects extreme seasonal cyclicity in temperature and rainfall in southern Turkey. However, deposits from the aqueduct of Cahors (Southern France), have cyclicity in δ18O that shows poor correlation with the microstructure and δ13C. This is probably due to the more variable, less seasonal rainfall patterns in southern France.\nCarbonate deposits from ancient aqueducts can serve as a high-resolution data source of palaeoclimate, and to determine the number of years the aqueducts functioned. Besides a regular lamination, most deposits also show single, distinct layers that can be a proxy for extreme weather events or earthquakes.\n ",

            "abstract": "The characterization and parameterization of both sedimentation and aggregation of volcanic particles is necessary for an accurate description of the sink term in numerical models of tephra dispersal used for the evaluation of tephra hazards. Nonetheless, our understanding of particle fallout in various eruptive and atmospheric conditions is still limited mostly due to the lack of direct observations. A comparative investigation of sedimentation and aggregation of volcanic particles is here presented based on field experiments and numerical simulations. Field experiments are based on detailed observations of particle fallout during Vulcanian explosions and ash emissions at Sakurajima volcano (Japan) on August 3, 2013. Column height was up to about 3 km above sea level and the cloud spread with average velocity of about 7 ms-1 toward southeast direction. Aggregates that fell at a distance of about 4 km from the vent were filmed with a high-speed and high-resolution camera before depositing on collection glasses. In order to preserve and analyze particle aggregates with the Scanning Electron Microscope, collecting glasses were covered with a special adhesive tape. Dedicated trays were also used to collect the depositing tephra at five-minute intervals to investigate both accumulation rate and particle size. CILAS grain size analysis showed that mode of particles deposited on the ground decreased with time from 550 μm to 250 μm at the reference location. Aggregate size ranged between 400 and 900 μm (based on video analysis) and they mostly consist of a single or multiple particles acting as nuclei with diameter between 200 and 800 μm coated with ash particles (<90 μm). Also aggregate size decreased with time during fallout and aggregate typology changed from mostly coated particles to ash clusters. Aggregation significantly affected particle residence time in the spreading cloud by changing the associated settling velocity. Based on numerical constraints, aggregates were thought to be formed within the rising plume or at the corner with the horizontal cloud and within 200 seconds of the onset of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "Observation of cliff erosion are often limited to relatively short timescales (a few decades), which are within the timeframe of anthropogenic modification of the coast and may be shorter than the recurrence interval for erosion events. Here we present long-term (centennial-millennial) averaged rates of sea cliff retreat for chalk cliffs in SE England derived from cosmogenic isotopes and coastal morphology. We determine long-term rates of sea cliff erosion from 10Be measured from in situ flint samples collected from three transects across the coastal platform in East Sussex. A numerical model of 10Be accumulation on an evolving coastal profile allows estimation of cliff retreat rate averaged over several hundred years. The model accounts for variation in 10Be accumulation with tides and sea-level rise, and takes into account platform downwear and topographic shielding by adjacent cliffs. Additionally, we use high-resolution (1m) multibeam bathymetry to map the extent of the coastal platform based on the surface texture in order to infer the position of the coast at ~8 ka. The difference in position to the current coastline provides estimates of Holocene-averaged rates of cliff erosion for all chalk cliffed coastline in the region. Comparison to historic records of cliff retreat reveals key similarities and differences between long and short-term signals. In certain locations, there are significant discrepancies (either faster or slower) between historic records and long-term rates of retreat. Each type of discrepancy may be the result of human interaction with the coastal environment, whether that interaction is local or non-local, and it is worthwhile noting that sites of relatively low historic rates of erosion are likely subject to high-magnitude, low-frequency failure events that could have devastating effects on human lives and infrastructure in areas that are considered to be low risk.",

High resolution simulations are conducted with triple nested domains having horizontal resolution of 27, 9 and 3 km; 27 vertical levels by using the 1x1 degree NCEP Final Analysis meteorological fields for initial and boundary conditions. In the study, eight fair weather days in winter and pre-monsoon season (January and April 2009). Sensitivity experiments of WRF-ARW model are conducted with two non-local [Yonsei University (YSU), Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2)] and three local turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) closure [Mellor- Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 2.5 PBL (MYNN2), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), and quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE)] turbulence diffusion parameterizations to study the evolution of PBL parameters and thermodynamic structure during the study period for providing the better meteorological parameters to AERMOD model. Sensitivity studies of PBL parameterization schemes after validation and statistical analysis reveal that the non-local PBL scheme YSU and local scheme MYJ could capture the characteristic variations of surface meteorological variables, vertical atmospheric structure as seen in observations. These simulations are coupled with AERMOD model is employed to evaluate the dispersion of NOX. After validating with monitored air quality data it is found that the integrated model with YSU followed by MYJ schemes performed better.\nKeywords: WRF, AERMOD, Dispersion, Planetary Boundary Layer",

A key problem is the lack of information about thermodynamic properties of semi- and low volatile organic molecules.\nSaturation vapor pressure and the associated temperature dependence (dH) are key parameters for improving predictive atmospheric models. In this work we combine experiments and thermodynamic modeling to investigate these parameters for a series of polyols, so-called sugar alcohols. These polyols are common in the water soluble fraction of atmospheric aerosols.\nIn our experimental system sub-micron particles are generated by nebulization from aqueous solution, and a mono disperse fraction of the aerosol is selected using a differential mobility analyzer. The particles are allowed to evaporate in a laminar flow reactor, and changes in particle size as function of evaporation time are determined using a scanning mobility particle sizer system. In this work saturation vapor pressures of sugar alcohols at several temperatures have been inferred from such measurements using thermodynamic modeling. Results are presented and discussed in context of atmospheric gas to particle partitioning.",

            "abstract": "The onshore Otway Basin is dominated by normal faults and only minimal strike-slip faulting has been reported. The basin is part of the NW-striking, passive margin that records the break-up of Gondwana and the Antarctic-Australian separation between Late Jurassic and Miocene times. From a 3D seismic cube (ca. 8 km x 7 km x 4 km depth) around the CO2CRC Otway site in SE Australia, we interpreted eight major, Cretaceous and Tertiary stratigraphic horizons (all syn-rift) and over 24 major normal faults.\nDetailed analysis of the fault system in our 3D geological model shows that the area is characterised by southwest-dipping, normal faults that have a listric character in the SW and planar character in the NE. North-dipping, antithetic faults developed secondarily due to movement on the major faults. Syn-sedimentary movement caused fourfold strata thicknesses in the hanging-wall of the faults. Fault offset increases towards the south; up to 800 m in the lower stratigraphy. Most faults, however, die out before the Eocene.\nUsing different techniques we determined that 60% the major faults didn't move in a pure dip-slip fashion, rather the movement contained a component of dextral strike-slip. In particular, juxtaposition maps of the stratigraphic horizons on the fault surfaces shows that in the obliquely-displaced faults the tip-lines of the faults are extremely asymmetric, with one flatly-dipping tip-line and one steep, overturned tip-line. Dip-slip faults demonstrate symmetrical convergence of the tip-lines. However faults with different kinematics are not grouped, but heterogeneously distributed over the model, suggesting strain-partitioning took place. This evidences that faults react differently when the stress field in the passive margin changes direction, but in a way that suggests that they are interacting.",

            "abstract": "Foliations in metapelites belong to the most important tools in structural geology to reconstruct deformation history and kinematics. Since foliations are easily developed and are hard to destroy, multiple foliations, associated with other structures such as folds and boudins, serve as a basis in reconstructing the tectonic history of all metamorphic terrains. Traditionally, such reconstructions assume regionally homogeneous tectonic effects producing distinct generations of structures, which are then labelled D1, D2, D3 etc.\nThe Goantagab Domain in NW Namibia consists of Neoproterozoic pelitic and psammitic metaturbidites with only minor changes in facies, exposed over an area of 80x40km. The rocks were deformed in a transpressive Neoproterozoic to Cambrian tectonic event during the amalgamation of Gondwanaland. Five overprinting foliations can be recognised in the area, but only three are recognisable at any location and no foliation extends over the entire area. Apparently, small variations in kinematic vorticity and other kinematic parameters and in orientation of incremental strain axes lead to local foliation development and to gradients in foliation style. The similarity in field and microstructure of the different foliations, and gradations in their development make a classical approach using D1-D2-D3 labelling problematic. Since the fieldwork area is very well exposed, it is possible to determine which factors lead to local development and destruction of foliations during ongoing ductile deformation. Detailed analysis of the local foliation architecture and history is used to explore new methods in structural geology to handle complex multiple foliations in metamorphic terrains",

            "abstract": "A carbon sequestration strategy was recently proposed in which a forest is sustainably managed, and a fraction of the wood is selectively harvested and stored to prevent decomposition under anaerobic, dry or cold conditions. Because a large flux of CO2 is constantly assimilated into the world’s forests via photosynthesis, partially cutting off its return pathway to the atmosphere forms an effective carbon sink. The live trees serve as a ‘carbon scrubber’ or ‘carbon remover’ that provides continuous sequestration. The stored wood is a semi-permanent carbon sink, but also serves as a ‘biomass/bioenergy reserve’ that could be utilized in the future if deemed more beneficial, for instance, by contributing to supply infrastructure for biomass power generation.\nBased on global forest coarse wood production rate, land availability, conservation, other wood use, and other practical constraints, we estimate a carbon sequestration potential for wood harvest and storage (WHS) 1-3 GtC y-1. The implementation of such a scheme at our estimated lower value of 1 GtC y-1 would imply a doubling of the current world wood harvest rate. This can be achieved by harvesting wood at a modest harvesting intensity of 1.2 tC ha-1 y-1, over a forest area of 8 Mkm2 (800 Mha). To achieve the higher value of 3 GtC y-1, forests need to be managed this way on half of the world’s forested land, or on a smaller area but with higher harvest intensity. However, any successful implementation strategy will need to balance the needs of the local community and environment. It nonethelss provides a novel new addition to a portfolio of existing forest management strategies. We propose ‘carbon sequestration and biomass farms’ with mixed land use for carbon, energy, agriculture, as well as conservation, provided that governance issues are properly dealt with. In another example, the forests damaged by insects, fire, storms such as in the America West could be thinned to reduce fire danger and harvested for carbon sequestration.\nBased on forestry data, We estimate a cost of $10-50/tCO2 for harvest and storage around the landing site. The technique is low tech, distributed, easy to monitor and verify. We compare the potential and cost of WHS with a number of other carbon sequestration methods, and recommend research into WHS as a 'down-to-earth' strategy for climate mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 variability is markedly influenced by biospheric fluxes (photosynthesis and respiration) from the land surface at seasonal, to annual, to decadal time scales. Process models of photosynthesis and respiration have considerable uncertainty as only the sum of these fluxes can be constrained on the bases of atmospheric CO2 measurements alone. An independent proxy for photosynthesis or gross primary productivity (GPP) has recently become available from measurement of solar induced fluorescence (SIF). We report here on the first (to our knowledge) simulations of global atmospheric CO2 concentration driven by GPP estimated from observations of SIF. A baseline model uses satellite derived FPAR, incident solar radiation, temperature, and moisture stress scalars to estimate net primary productivity (NPP). The fluorescence driven model uses only fluorescence from GOME-2 scaled to the mean annual NPP at every grid cell and assumes a constant NPP/GPP ratio. Respiration was modeled identically in the two simulations. This preserves the spatial distribution of production capacity but allows for independent seasonal cycle and interannual variability from the baseline model. The flux models were run at ½ degree monthly resolution for 2007-2012 and fluxes were reaggregated along with fossil fuel and ocean fluxes to 3-hourly, 1 x 1.25 degree resolution for the atmospheric transport model. Here, we compare the model’s skill at predicting CO2 variability at 40 NOAA CO2 flask network sites. The baseline model shows good skill at matching the seasonal cycle at the flask sites but is not as good at producing monthly and interannual anomalies. The fluorescence model shows similar (or even improved) performance even though solar radiation, FPAR, precipitation and temperature effects on GPP are not included in the simulation. The results demonstrate the capability of the fluorescence data to integrate physiological and biophysical controls on GPP into a single measured parameter.",

In this study, we compare different ways to estimate future return levels for heavy rainfall, based on the statistical extreme value theory. Both Peaks over Threshold (POT) and block maxima with the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution will be used and their results compared when linear trends are assumed in the parameters: threshold and scale parameter for POT and location and scale parameter for GEV. But rainfall over the IP is a special variable in that a large number of the values are 0. Thus, the impact of taking this into account is discussed too. Another approach is then tested, based on the evolutions of the mean and variance obtained from the time series of rainy days only, and of the number of rainy days. A statistical test, similar to that designed for temperature in Parey et al. 2013, is used to assess if the trends in extremes can be considered as mostly due to these evolutions when considering only rainy days. The results show that it is mainly the case: the extremes of the residuals, after removing the trends in mean and standard deviation, cannot be differentiated from those of a stationary process. Thus, the future return levels can be estimated from the stationary return level of these residuals and an estimation of the future mean and standard deviation. Moreover, an estimation of the future number of rainy days is used to retrieve the return levels for all days. All of these comparisons are made for an ensemble of high quality rainfall time series observed in the Iberian Peninsula over the period 1961-2010, from which we want to estimate a 20-year return level expected in 2020. The evolutions and the impact of the different approaches will be discussed for 3 seasons: fall, spring and winter.\nParey S., Hoang T.T.H., Dacunha-Castelle D.: The importance of mean and variance in predicting changes in temperature extremes, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, Vol. 118, 1–12, 2013.",

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) develops MASCOT with contributions from CNES (France) (2,3). Main objective is to in-situ map the asteroid’s geomorphology, the intimate structure, texture and composition of the regolith (dust, soil and rocks), and the thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties of the surface in order to provide ground truth for the orbiter remote measurements, support the selection of sampling sites, and provide context information for the returned samples. MASCOT comprises a payload of four scientific instruments: camera, radiometer, magnetometer and hyperspectral microscope. C- and D-type asteroids hold clues to the origin of the solar system, the formation of planets, the origins of water and life on Earth, the protection of Earth from impacts, and resources for future human exploration. C- and D-types are dark and difficult to study from Earth, and have only been glimpsed by spacecraft. While results from recent missions (e.g., Hayabusa, NEAR (4, 5, 6)) have dramatically increased our understanding of asteroids, important questions remain. For example, characterizing the properties of asteroid regolith in-situ would deliver important ground truth for further understanding telescopic and orbital observations and samples of such asteroids. MASCOT will descend and land on the asteroid and will change its position two times by hopping. This enables measurements during descent, at the landing and hopping positions #1-3, and during hopping.\nHayabusa 2 together with Mascot will launch beginning of December 2014, arrive at 1999JU3 in 2018 and return samples back to Earth in 2020.\n",

Since 2010, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory returns 1.4 TB/day of high-resolution solar images, magnetograms and EUV irradiance data. Within a few years, the scientific community will thus have access to petabytes of multi­dimensional remote­sensing and complex in-situ observations from different vantage points, complemented by petabytes of simulation data.\nAnswering overarching science questions like “How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability and space weather?” will only be possible if the community has the necessary tools at hand. As of today, there is an obvious lack of capability to both visualize these data and assimilate them into sophisticated models to advance our knowledge. A key piece needed to bridge the gap between observables, derived quantities like magnetic field extrapolations and model output is a tool to routinely and intuitively visualize large heterogeneous, multidimensional, time­dependent data sets. As of today, the space science community is lacking the means to do this (i) on a routine basis, (ii) for complex multi­dimensional data sets from various instruments and vantage points and (iii) in an extensible and modular way that is open for future improvements and interdisciplinary usage. In this contribution, we will present recent progress in visualizing the Sun and its magnetic field in 3D using the open-source JHelioviewer framework, which is part of the ESA/NASA Helioviewer Project. Among other features, JHelioviewer offers efficient region-of-interest-based data streaming, metadata and event catalog integration, as well as an interface to access science-quality data. In addition to its usage by the solar physics community, JHelioviewer has already been successfully adapted for application in planetary sciences and medical imaging.",

Teachers have specific standards or subject matters that they are required to cover and often soils and soil science is not included in that list. We have struggled with ways to bring soil science information to the larger audience as the direct approach meets with resistance due to the time commitments to other standards. Our approach now is to use soils as a media or vehicle to teach key concepts in broad subject areas. We have developed several lesson plans in science, geography, math and art that focus on a concept but use soils to convey it. For example students make “mini” monoliths of a state soil. During this exercise students need to use skills in geography to find where their state soil occurs in their state and in the country. They need to understand colors in order to choose the correct colors to use to make their monolith. Finally, they must understand how scales work in order to make the monolith accurate in terms of horizon depths. Throughout the exercise discussion on my certain colors occur in the soil can be discussed. This discussion can lead to a qualitative understanding of chemistry and biology. This presentation will demonstrate this lesson and several others that have been developed and available through the Soil Science Society of America’s K12 Education Committee and our International Year of Soil website.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the problem of intraplate melt generation with the aim of understanding spatial and temporal relationships between magmatism and extremely slow intraplate deformation. We present numerical models that consider feedback between melt generation and lithospheric deformation and incorporate three different damage mechanisms: brittle damage, creep damage, and melt damage. Melt conditions are calculated with a Gibbs energy minimization method, and the energy equation solved self-consistently for latent heat and shear heating effects. We use an extremely slowly lithosphere extension model (1-1.5 mm/y) to investigate the mechanics leading to intraplate volcanism in a cold lithosphere (~50mW/m2) such as the Harrat Ash-Shaam volcanic field in NW Arabia. We find that the extremely slow extension is a key to a very potent melt transfer mechanism through the lithosphere. The mechanism relies on multiple feedback mechanisms active in the accommodation of strain in the presence of fluids. These are capable of generating melts in the lithosphere/asthenosphere even in regions of relatively low heat flux. Once low degrees of partial melts are generated, the triple feedback between brittle-creep and melt damage leads to high porosity lithospheric-scale shear zones capable of transferring melts and fluids to the surface. Efficient localization in the weaker ductile domains implies that the final pattern of strain distribution is controlled by slow creep from below rather than by brittle deformation from above. Our model provides an explanation for intraplate volcanic provinces, which appear to rely on slowly deforming lithospheres. A significant finding is that slow extension, rather than fast extension, can localize melt damage more effectively in the deeper creeping section of the lithosphere. This finding may have profound implications to the fundamental dynamic control on intraplate volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Organic nitrogen (ON) can be a significant contributor of bioavailable N to the phytoplankton and bacteria that cause eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. In urban systems, urban stormwater runoff containing ON compounds is one source of potentially bioavailable N in water bodies. However, ON characterization and concentrations in urban stormwater are rarely reported or considered for urban stormwater management. We instrumented a 13-hectare residential catchment in Florida’s Tampa Bay area with an ISCO autosampler and collected storm event runoff samples at 15-minute intervals during the 2013 wet season (June to September, n =236). Our objectives were to determine the (1) relative importance of ON compared to inorganic N forms (i.e., NO3- and NH4+) in the runoff, (2) investigate temporal trends in the ON concentrations in runoff, and (3) assess how rainfall depth and intensity affect any temporal trends. Mean concentration of total N in stormwater runoff for the wet season was 1.86 mg/l, of which dissolved and particulate ON were 63%. The dominance of ON in urban stormwater runoff suggests that the ON fraction should also be targeted when stormwater control measures call for N reductions. Particulate ON (PON) displayed a strong seasonal first flush trend as season progressed from June (1.45 mg/l; n =75) to September (0.20 mg/l; n = 28), while dissolved ON (DON) did not display any seasonal trend, with mean monthly concentrations ranging from 0.36 to 0.80 mg/l. A principal component analysis using storm event N concentrations, rainfall depth, and rainfall intensity as variables showed no significant correlation, suggesting that storms of various sizes and intensities can mobilize ON. The seasonal first flush observed for PON in the wet season can provide a window of time for optimal N removal and implies that stormwater best management practices should focus on capturing plant materials earlier in the season.",

            "abstract": "Data from the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) and Magnetometer (MAG) sensors on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft have revealed stark differences in the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability at Mercury compared with that at Earth. Although K-H vortices have been documented in planetary magnetospheres at the interface of magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas, such features at Mercury have been observed exclusively on the dusk side. From a survey of 58 K-H events, we find that these vortices have two distinct sets of behavior separated by the dusk terminator. On the dayside, the wave frequencies measured by MAG are nearly constant at ~0.025 Hz (~40 s period) under a variety of magnetosheath conditions, whereas the wave frequency measured on the nightside is correlated with the strength of the magnetic field near the magnetopause and matches the local Na+ gyrofrequency. The polarization of these waves inside the magnetosphere is distinctly right-handed, consistent with non-linear roll-up of K-H vortices as opposed to the left-handed ion-cyclotron wave mode. During these events, measurements from FIPS reveal strong (~30%) concentrations of Na+ in the nightside plasma sheet adjacent to the magnetopause. The keV energies of these planetary ions provide them with gyroradii that are ~500-1000 km, a scale at which a kinetic description of the K-H instability may be appropriate at Mercury. These data suggest a transition from fluid-scale to kinetic scale K-H vortices from day to night along Mercury’s duskside magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical data for H2O and other volatiles, as well as major and trace elements, in 384 samples of lunar volcanic glass from three chemical groups (A15 green, A15 yellow, A17 orange 74220) constrain the behavior of volatile elements during formation and evolution of the Moon. These data are combined with published data to estimate the composition of the bulk silicate Moon (BSM). Previous estimates of the volatile element budget of the BSM, constrained by the compositions of mare basalts, are biased to low concentrations due to degassing of volatiles during mare basalt eruption and cooling; lunar picritic glasses, which have very short cooling times, are much less depleted in volatiles compared with mare basalts. The estimated BSM composition for volatile elements, constrained by H2O/Ce ratios and S contents in melt inclusions from orange glass sample 74220, are only moderately depleted compared with the bulk silicate Earth (0.1 – 0.3X BSE) and essentially overlap the composition of the terrestrial depleted MORB source. In a single giant impact scenario for the origin for the Moon, the Moon-forming material experiences three distinct stages of evolution characterized by very different timescales. Impact mass ejection (hours to days) and proto-lunar disk evolution (10s to 100s of years), both produce conditions that separate volatile elements into an atmospheric volume much larger than the Moon-forming magma disk, even under conditions in which hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen is difficult; this inevitably results in accretion of the Moon in a volatile-depleted state while the majority of the vapor surrounding the disk becomes incorporated into the Earth’s atmosphere. Only the extended evolution of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) presents a time window sufficiently long (10-200 Ma), and at the right time (4.30 – 4.50 Ga), for the Moon to gain water during the tail end of accretion. Yet there exists little evidence that the Moon formed in a singular event, as all detailed accretion models predict several giant impacts in the terrestrial planet region in which the Earth forms. It is thus likely that the Moon, like the Earth, experienced a history of heterogeneous accretion, with the possibility that the Moon may have inherited material directly from the Earth prior to the final giant impact.",

To understand these events, and to judge whether they represent environmental change, we need to compare today's weather to the long-term historical record. Our long-term historical record of the weather is based on the billions of observations, from scientists, explorers, mariners, and others, that have been made, across the world, over the last few centuries.\nMany of these records are still dark: They exist only as hand-written paper documents in various archives and libraries, and are inaccessible to science. As a result our historical weather reconstructions have major gaps, where we do not know how the climate has varied.\noldWeather.org is a citizen science project rescuing these observations. By providing an web interface to scans of paper records, we enable volunteers around the world to contribute to the task of rescuing the observations. So far a community of around 20,000 volunteers have read well over 1 million pages of paper records and contributed millions of recovered weather observations to international climate datasets.\nAs well as learning about past weather, we are also learning what it takes to build a successful volunteer science project in this area: building a community, breaking down the task into manageable steps, feeding back success to the volunteers, and enabling comitted volunteers to take on more responsibilities were all vital to our success. We are currently using those lessons to build a new version of oldWeather that can rescue even more data.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture and the monsoon are inextricably linked in India. A large part of the steady rise in agricultural production since the onset of the Green Revolution in the 1960’s has been attributed to irrigation. Irrigation is used to supplement and buffer crops against precipitation shocks, but water availability for such use is itself sensitive to the erratic, seasonal and spatially heterogeneous nature of the monsoon. We provide new evidence on the relationship between monsoon changes, irrigation variability and water availability by linking a process based hydrology model with an econometric model for one of the world’s most water stressed countries. India uses more groundwater for irrigation than any other country, and there is substantial evidence that this has led to depletion of groundwater aquifers. First, we build an econometric model of historical irrigation decisions using detailed agriculture and weather data spanning 35 years. Multivariate regression models reveal that for crops grown in the wet season, irrigation is sensitive to distribution and total monsoon rainfall but not to ground or surface water availability. For crops grown in the dry season, total monsoon rainfall matters most, and its effect is sensitive to groundwater availability. The historical estimates from the econometric model are used to calculate future irrigated areas under three different climate model predictions of monsoon climate for the years 2010 – 2050. These projections are then used as input to a physical hydrology model, which quantifies supply of irrigation water from sustainable sources such as rechargeable shallow groundwater, rivers and reservoirs, to unsustainable sources such as non- rechargeable groundwater. We find that the significant variation in monsoon projections lead to very different results. Crops grown in the dry season show particularly divergent trends between model projections, leading to very different groundwater resource requirements.",

The accumulation of tilted lake-margin sediments interfingered with basalt flows began 1.1 Ma and ended after 0.6 Ma. The excavations (1989–1997) exposed 34 m thick deposits that provide unique data sets on climate, environment, biology, culture and hominin behavior. Hominin presence is known throughout the sequence, providing information on Acheulian technology and cognition along the time trajectory, but the richest sites (15 in number) occur above the M/B Chron Boundary. Reconstructions of paleoenvironment and habitats are based on fossil remains yielding an extremely rich typically Mediterranean biomass of diverse biogeographic origins. Macro and micro organic material (over 140 identified taxa) exhibits a typical Mediterranean environment similar to the extant flora, with few extinctions (20 species). The rich fossil faunal include molluscs, ostracods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, micromammals and medium-sized to large mammals (over 237 taxa), predominantly Palearctic in biogeographic origin. Many of these taxa are still extant, attesting to stable habitats and paleoclimatic conditions. Hominin occupations are documented by thousands of lithic artifacts (flint, limestone and basalt), all assigned to the Large Flake Acheulian culture. These assemblages show a continuous cultural tradition of the same tool kit along the time trajectory. The lithic reduction required developed cognitive abilities and communication abilities, interpreted as language. Evidence of hominin subsistence includes data on carcass processing including extraction of marrow, with a preference for consumption of fallow deer, elephant, hippopotamus and fish. Edible plant remains include nuts, USO, fruits, seeds and vegetables in association with stone artifacts and animal bones. Fire, present throughout, was clearly instrumental in the expansion of diet and is documented spatially. The GBY analyses provide novel evidence for hominin adaptations to a Mediterranean environment and prolonged Levantine Corridor occupations, illustrating the mechanisms of diffusion along the African Great Rift system.",

In fact, quantitative micropaleontological analysis of benthic foraminifera assemblages highlighted 12 anomalous intervals, marked by peaks with high percentages of displaced epiphytic specimens and an increase in the sandy component. These anomalies were generally accompanied by a significant amount of Posidonia remnants, a localized concentration of molluscs and organic-rich bands. Thus, the twelve anomalous peaks were interpreted as the primary effect of tsunami waves (back-wash). Moreover, five out of the twelve anomalous layers were embedded in age intervals encompassing the dates of major tsunamis that hit eastern Sicily (1908, 1693, and 1169) and the broader Eastern Mediterranean (AD 365 Crete and Santorini at about BP 3600).\nSeven additional cores were sampled from the northern part of the Augusta Bay, along a transect 60 to 110 m of water depth, to retrieve the details of the MS06 sequence uppermost part. Four out of the seven new cores were selected and studied. Preliminary dating suggests that the sampled sequence spans ca. 400-500 yrs. Moreover, physical properties, ITRAX X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and grain size analyses point out the presence of a peculiar interval made of Posidonia remnants, coarse sand and shell debris on the two cores closer to the shore. The two far-off cores seem to be more homogenous but a few thin sandy lenses enriched of Posidonia remnant were also recognized. Further detailed micropaleontological analysis and corroboration with instrumental data are still in progress and will help in discriminating single events potentially related to tsunami back-wash.",

While the Moroccan Turbidite System is extremely well investigated, almost no data from the source region, i.e. the Agadir Canyon, are available. Understanding why some submarine landslides remain as coherent blocks of sediment throughout their passage downslope, while others mix and disintegrate almost immediately after initial failure, is a major scientific challenge, which was addressed in the Agadir Canyon source region during Cruise MSM32. We collected ~ 1500 km of high-resolution seismic 2D-lines in combination with a dense net of hydroacoustic data. About 1000 km2 of sea floor were imaged during three deployments of TOBI (deep-towed sidescan sonar operated by the National Oceanography Centre Southampton). A total of 186 m of gravity cores and several giant box cores were recovered at more than 50 stations. The new data show that Agadir canyon is the source area of the world’s largest submarine sediment flow, which occurred about 60,000 years ago. Up to 160 km3 of sediment was transported to the deep ocean in a single catastrophic event. For the first time, sediment flows of this scale have been tracked along their entire flow pathway. A major landslide area was identified south of Agadir Canyon. Landslide material enters Agadir canyon in about 2500 m water depth; the material is transported as debrite for at least another 200 km down the canyon. Initial data suggest that the last major slide from this source entered Agadir canyon at least 130,000 years ago. A large field of living deep-water corals was imaged north of Agadir canyon. To our knowledge, these are the first living cold water corals recovered off the coast of Morocco (except for the Gulf of Cadiz). They represent an important link between the known cold-water coral provinces off Mauritania and in the Gulf of Cádiz.",

            "abstract": "The recent tsunamigenic Tohoku earthquake (2011) strongly affirms, again, after the 26 December 2004, the necessity to open new paradigms in oceanic monitoring. Detection of ionospheric anomalies following the Sumatra earthquake tsunami (e.g., Occhipinti et al. 2006) demonstrated that ionosphere is sensitive to earthquake and tsunami propagation: ground and oceanic vertical displacement induces acoustic-gravity waves propagating within the neutral atmosphere and detectable in the ionosphere. Observations supported by modelling proved that tsunamigenic ionospheric anomalies are deterministic and reproducible by numerical modeling via the ocean/neutral-atmosphere/ionosphere coupling mechanism (Occhipinti et al., 2008). To prove that the tsunami signature in the ionosphere is routinely detected we show here perturbations of total electron content (TEC) measured by GPS and following tsunamigenic eartquakes from 2004 to 2010 (Rolland et al. 2010, Occhipinti et al., 2013, Occhipinti, 2014), nominally, Sumatra (26 December, 2004 and 12 September, 2007), Chile (14 November, 2007), Samoa (29 September, 2009) and the recent Tohoku-Oki (11 Mars, 2011). In addition to GPS/TEC observations close to the epicenter and measured by GEONET network, new exciting measurements in the far-field were performed by Airglow measurement in Hawaii: those measurements show the propagation of the IGWs induced by the Tohoku tsunami in the Pacific Ocean (Occhipinti et al., 2011). Based on the observations close to the epicenter, mainly performed by GPS networks located in Sumatra, Chile and Japan, we highlight the TEC perturbation observed within the first hour after the seismic rupture. This perturbation contains informations about the ground displacement, as well as the consequent sea surface displacement resulting in the tsunami. In this talk we present all this new tsunami observations in the ionosphere and we discuss, under the light of modelling, the potential role of ionospheric sounding in the oceanic monitoring and future tsunami warning system by GPS, Airglow and OTH radar (Coisson et al., 2011).

            "abstract": "Freshwater is a vital natural resource for multiple needs, such as drinking water for the public, industrial processes, hydropower for energy companies, and irrigation for agriculture. In the UK, crop production is the largest in East Anglia, while at the same time the region is also the driest, with average annual rainfall between 560 and 720 mm (1971 to 2000). Many water catchments of East Anglia are reported as over licensed or over abstracted. Therefore, freshwater available for agricultural irrigation abstraction in this region is becoming both increasingly scarce due to competing demands, and increasingly variable and uncertain due to climate and policy changes. It is vital for water users and policy makers to understand how these factors will affect individual abstractors and water resource management at the system level. We present first results of an Agent-based Model that captures the complexity of this system as individual abstractors interact, learn and adapt to these internal and external changes.\nThe purpose of this model is to simulate what patterns of water resource management emerge on the system level based on local interactions, adaptations and behaviours, and what policies lead to a sustainable water resource management system. The model is based on an irrigation abstractor typology derived from a survey in the study area, to capture individual behavioural intentions under a range of water availability scenarios, in addition to farm attributes, and demographics. Regional climate change scenarios, current and new abstraction licence reforms by the UK regulator, such as water trading and water shares, and estimated demand increases from other sectors were used as additional input data. Findings from the integrated model provide new understanding of the patterns of water resource management likely to emerge at the system level.",

            "abstract": "A complete assessment of climate change projections requires understanding the combined effects of decadal variability and long-term trends and evaluating the ability of models to simulate them. The western Amazon severe droughts of the 2000s were the result of a modest drying trend enhanced by reduced moisture transport from the tropical Atlantic. Most of the WA dry-season precipitation decadal variability is attributable to decadal fluctuations of the north-south gradient (NSG) in Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST). The observed WA and NSG decadal co-variability is well reproduced in Global Climate Models (GCMs) pre-industrial control (PIC) and historical (HIST) experiments that were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report (IPCC-AR5). This suggests that unforced or natural climate variability, characteristic of the PIC simulations, determines the nature of this coupling, as the results from HIST simulations (forced with greenhouse gases (GHG) and natural and anthropogenic aerosols) are comparable in magnitude and spatial distribution. Decadal fluctuation in the NSG also determines shifts in the probability of repeated droughts and pluvials in WA, as there is a 65% chance of 3 or more years of droughts per decade when NSG>0 compared to 18% when NSG<0. The HIST and PIC model simulations also reproduce the observed shifts in probability distribution of droughts and pluvials as a function of the NSG decadal phase, suggesting there is great potential for decadal predictability based on GCMs. Persistence of the current NSG positive phase may lead to continuing above normal frequencies of western Amazon dry-season droughts.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, the driving forces for SOA growth is believed to be the partitioning onto aerosol seeds of condensable gases, either emitted primarily or resulting from the gas phase oxidation of organic gases. However, even the most up-to-date models based on such mechanisms cannot account for the SOA mass observed in the atmosphere, suggesting the existence of other, yet unknown formation processes. The present study shows experimental evidence that particulate phase chemistry produces photo-sensitizers that lead to photo-induced formation and growth of secondary organic aerosol in the near UV and the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as terpenes.\nBy means of an aerosol flow tube reactor equipped with Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Differential Mobility Analyzer (DMA) and Condensation Particle Sizer (CPC), we identified that traces in the aerosol phase of glyoxal chemistry products, namely imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC) are strong photo-sensitizers when irradiated with near-UV. In the presence of volatile organic compounds such as terpenes, this chemistry leads to a fast aerosol growth.\nGiven the potential importance of this new photosensitized growth pathway for ambient OA, the related reaction mechanism was investigated at a molecular level. Bulk and flow tube experiments were performed to identify major products of the reaction of limonene with the triplet state of IC by direct (+/-)ESI-HRMS and UPLC/(+/-)HESI-HRMS analysis. Detection of recombination products of IC with limonene or with itself, in bulk and flow tube experiment ts, showed that IC is able to initiate a radical chemistry in the aerosol phase under realistic irradiation conditions. Furthermore, highly oxygenated limonene reaction products were detected, clearly explaining the observed OA growth. The chemistry of peroxy radicals derived from limonene upon addition of oxygen explains the formation of such low-volatile compounds without any traditional gas phase oxidant.\nThese results demonstrate that, upon ageing, organic aerosols can produce photo-sensitizers which auto-photo-catalyse their SOA growth.",

            "abstract": "Topo-Iberia has been a large-scale Spanish project running from 2007 to 2013 that integrated more than 150 researchers on Earth Sciences. One of its key assets was the management of an observatory platform, named IberArray, aimed to provide new geophysical datasets (seismic, GPS, MT) to constrain the structure of Iberia with unprecedented resolution. The IberArray seismic pool was composed by 70+ BB stations, covering the study area in 3 deployments with a site-density of 60km x 60km. The data base holds ~300 sites, including the permanent networks in the area. Hence it forms a unique seismic database in Europe that allow for multiple analyses to constrain the complex geodinamics of the Western Mediterranean. A summary of new results coming from different techniques is presented here. The SKS splitting analysis has provided a spectacular image of the rotation of the fast velocity direction along the Gibraltar Arc. In central and northern Iberia, the fast polarization directions are close to EW, consistently with global mantle flow models considering contributions of surface plate motion, density variations and net lithosphere rotation. Those results suggest an asthenospheric origin of the observed anisotropy related to present-day mantle flow. Receiver functions have revealed the crustal thickness variations beneath the Rif and southern Iberia, including a crustal root beneath the Rif. The Variscan Iberian massif shows a flat Moho discontinuity, while the areas reworked in the Alpine orogeny show a slightly thicker crust. Beneath N Iberia, the imbrication of the Iberian and Eurasian crusts results in complex receiver functions. Depths exceeding 45 km are observed along the Pyrenean range, while the crust thins to values of 26-28 km close to the Atlantic coasts. The geometry of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities has been investigated using novel cross-correlation/stacking techniques. Ambient noise tomography allows to identify the main sedimentary basins and to discriminate between the Variscan and the Alpine reworked areas. Local body-wave tomography in North Morocco has improved the location of the small magnitude events on the area and the details of the crustal structure. Teleseismic tomography has confirmed, using an independent data set, the presence of a high-velocity slab beneath the Gibraltar Arc.",

PP-SESAME will thus allow to determine the water ice content in the near-surface and to monitor its diurnal and orbital variations thus providing essential insight on the activity and evolution of the cometary nucleus.\nThe PP-SESAME instrument is derived from the quadrupole array technique. A sinusoidal electrical current is sent into the ground through a first dipole, and the induced electrical voltage is measured with a second dipole. The complex permittivity of the material is inferred from the mutual impedance derived from the measurements. In practice, the influence of both the electronic circuit of the instrument and the conducting elements in its close environment must be accounted for in order to best estimate the dielectric constant and electric conductivity of the ground. To do this we have developed a method called the “capacity-influence matrix method”.\nA replica of the instrument was recently built in LATMOS (France) and was tested in the frame of a field campaign in the giant ice cave system of Dachstein, Austria. In the caves, the ground is covered with a thick layer of ice, which temperature is rather constant throughout the year. This measurement campaign allowed us to test the “capacity influence matrix method” in a natural icy environment.\nThe first measurements of the PP-SESAME/Philae experiment should be available in mid-November. In this paper we will present the “capacity-influence matrix method”, the measurements and results from the Austrian field campaign and the preliminary analysis of the PP-SESAME/Philae data.",

The Cordillera Blanca Shear Zone (CBSZ) in the central Peruvian Andes records changes in temperature, microstructures, and deformation mechanisms that occurred during exhumation through the brittle-ductile-transition during normal-sense slip over the last ~5 m.y. The 100-500-m-thick mylonitic shear zone occupies the footwall of a 200-km-long normal detachment fault, marking the western boundary of the 8 Ma, leucogranodiorite Cordillera Blanca Batholith. Though local variations do occur, including recrystallized quartz veins and local, decimeter- to meter- scale shear zones, the CBSZ follows a general trend of increasing strain towards the detachment. Structurally lowest positions are weakly deformed and transition to protomylonite, mylonite, and ultramylonite at higher positions, truncating at a cataclasite nearest the detachment.\nWe characterize strain using EBSD analyses of quartz lattice preferred orientations and deformation temperatures using quartz and feldspar textures and two-feldspar thermometry of asymmetric strain-induced myrmekite. At the deepest structural positions, feldspar grains record a complex history characterized by bulging recrystallization, myrmekite formation, and brittle fracture, while quartz exhibits dominant grain-boundary migration recrystallization (T> 500 °C) and prism <a> slip. Intermediate samples exhibit more prevalent strain-induced myrmekite, brittle fracture in feldspar, and reaction-associated recrystallization of K-feldspar to mica; quartz records mainly subgrain-rotation recrystallization (400-500 °C) and dominant prism <a> slip with a rhomb <a> component. Shallower positions preserve fewer, smaller, and more rounded feldspar porphyroclasts with no myrmekite, and dominant bulging recrystallization (280-400 °C) in quartz that records prism <a>, rhomb <a>, and some basal <a> slip.",

            "abstract": "Classifying catchments represents a significant challenge to hydrology and hydrologic modeling, restricting widespread transfer of knowledge from well-studied sites. Traditionally, catchment classification has focused on identifying important physical, climatological, or hydrologic attributes (to varying degrees depending on application/data availability). Such classification approaches are regularly assessed with regard to their ability to provide suitable hydrologic predictions – commonly via the transfer of hydrologic model parameters from the catchment at which they were fitted to a catchment the classification deemed similar. While intuitive, such an approach makes the implicit assumption that physical similarity begets functional (model parameterization) similarity and ignores the most uncertain aspect of the process – the model itself. Here, we explore catchment classification and parameter transferability of the internally verifiable Catchment Connectivity Model across seven catchments located within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest. Our analysis investigates the roles of model consistency, parameter sensitivity, and catchment structure with regard to catchment classification and introduces the concept of universal donor and universal acceptor catchments.",

            "abstract": "One of the remaining challenges in paleoseismological research is quantification of ancient-earthquake magnitudes, and rupture locations and extent. Such reconstructions require multiple continuous paleoseismic records with excellent temporal and spatial resolution and stable threshold conditions, which can be offered by turbidite records in lakes. Recent, well-documented, great megathrust earthquakes provide an ideal opportunity to calibrate the turbidite record in different types of lakes, and determine which settings are suitable for quantitative paleoseismology. We study the sedimentary impact of the 1960 and 2010 Chilean megathrust earthquakes using 107 short sediment cores in 17 lakes. A combination of image analysis, magnetic susceptibility and grain-size analysis allowed to distinguish two types of lacustrine turbidites (i.e. LT1s and LT2s) from background sediments and other seismically-induced event deposits. LT1s have a composition similar to the hemipelagic background sediments and result from shallow mass wasting on sublacustrine slopes covered by hemipelagic sediments. LT2s have a composition different from the background sediments and can result from delta collapses, floods etc. Comparison of the frequency of all seismically-induced event deposits with local seismic intensities shows that turbidites, and especially LT1s, are most reliable for quantitative paleoseismology. LT1s are almost exclusively triggered by earthquake shaking and they most sensitively record varying seismic intensities. Over all studied lakes, the number of locations with LT1s linearly increases with increasing seismic intensity, starting with no LT1s at intensities just below VI and reaching 100% when intensities are higher than VII½. In 3 lakes that have been studied in higher detail, we found that also a turbidite’s spatial extent and thickness within a certain basin are a function of the local seismic intensity. Hence, these records allow determining the seismic intensity of ancient earthquakes at each lake. Consequently, our multilake turbidite record aids in pinpointing magnitudes, rupture locations, and extent of past subduction earthquakes in South-Central Chile. The consistent results in 17 lakes indicate that many more lacustrine basins worldwide have similar potential.",

Heavy loading of aerosols reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching ground, that could lower surface temperature, reduce ocean-land contrast and thus affect monsoon system, whereas solar energy absorbed by aerosols alters atmospheric stability to have a feedback effect on atmospheric dynamics. By altering cloud microphysics and macrophysics, aerosols can also change cloud properties and precipitation frequency and amount. All of these can influence regional weather and climate in a dramatically. We have analyzed ample data from long-term routine measurements, intensive field experiments and global satellite products to study, together with some modeling studies, to study the impact of aerosol on global and regional climate.

For many arc systems, onset of arc volcanism and early evolution are obscured by metamorphism or the record is deeply buried; however, initial products of arc systems may be preserved in forearc and backarc sedimentary records. IODP Expedition 351 recovered this history from the dispersed ash and pyroclast record in the proximal rear-arc of the northern IBM system west of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge. Drilling at Site U1438 in the Amami Sankaku Basin recovered a thick volcaniclastic record of subduction initiation and the early evolution of the Izu-Bonin Arc. A 160-m thick section of Neogene sediment overlies 1.3 kilometers of Paleogene volcaniclastic rocks with andesitic average composition; this volcaniclastic section was deposited on mafic volcanic basement rocks. The thin upper sediment layer is primarily terrigenous, biogenic and volcaniclastic mud and ooze with interspersed ash layers. The underlying Eocene to Oligocene volcaniclastic rocks are 33% tuffaceous mudstone, 61% tuffaceous sandstone, and 6% conglomerate with volcanic and rare sedimentary clasts commonly up to pebble and rarely to cobble size.

Collection 6 represents a significant advancement of the Deep Blue aerosol products.\nThe Deep Blue aerosol algorithm was first introduced into the MODIS operational stream for Collection 5.1 (C51). It was originally only applied over bright, non-snow surfaces such as deserts and urban areas and complemented the existing aerosol products that provided retrievals over dark vegetation. However, since then, an enhanced Deep Blue (e-Deep Blue) algorithm has been developed. Now, e-Deep Blue covers all snow-free land surfaces, including both deserts and vegetated regions, by utilizing more dynamic surface reflectance estimation techniques to account for seasonal cycles in vegetation. Cloud screening and aerosol model selection schemes have also been updated. Since the MODIS instrument on Terra continues to degrade, we’ve also applied the latest polarization and response-vs-scan-angle corrections to the MODIS C6 L1B data to improve the performance of the resulting e-Deep Blue aerosol products.\nHere we introduce our latest e-Deep Blue algorithm and C6 data products along with validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements for both Aqua and Terra MODIS instruments.",

Its northern termination displays a transcurrent shear zone network, the ~250 km long Além Paraíba-Pádua shear zone, which involves granulites, migmatites and granites facies mylonites deformed in transpression. A detailed microstructural and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) study of the rock-forming minerals is being undertaken to infer constraints on the rheology of continental crust during the nucleation and development of this shear zone. A variety of mylonites (from protomylonites to ultramylonites) have been analyzed by Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD) in order to determine the CPO of minerals, especially quartz, feldspars, amphibole, pyroxene and biotite. High-grade mylonites often exhibit ribbon-shaped quartz, probably due to high temperature grain boundary migration. They frequently wrap around K-feldspar porphyroclast exhibiting undulose extinction and core-mantle structures that may be related to bulging and/or subgrain rotation recrystallisation. In these HT mylonites, plagioclase is dynamically recrystallized and form fine-grained layers alternating with quartz-ribbons. Hornblende porphyroclasts present strain shadows of opaque mineral. Medium to high-grade mylonites derived from each felsic and mafic granulite and migmatitic gneisses show plagioclase with undulose extinction and deformation twins, quartz grains with both ribbon and porphyroclast shapes (> 3mm in size), orthopyroxene and garnet as porhyroclast and porphyroblast, respectively, and strongly oriented biotite. CPO of quartz indicates that it was deformed through plastic deformation with the activation of prism {a}. Feldspar CPOs show concentrations of [001] close to the lineation, of [010] close to the pole of the foliation and of [100] close to the Y strain axis, suggesting activation of the [001] (010) slip system.",

            "abstract": "The process of earthquake rupture nucleation and propagation has been investigated through laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling, but a limited number of observations exist at the scale of earthquake fault zones. Distinct models have been proposed, and whether the magnitude can be predicted while the rupture is ongoing represents an unsolved question. The ability to correctly distinguish a small shock from a large event through the analysis of the first P-wave observation is crucial for risk mitigation actions triggered by earthquake early warning systems. Here we show that the evolution of P-wave peak displacement with time is informative regarding the early stage of the rupture process and can be used as a proxy for the final size of the rupture. In the present study, we measure the peak displacement amplitude of filtered P-wave signals over a progressively expanding P-wave time window, starting from the P-wave onset time, and expanding the time window until the expected arrival of the S-waves. We use a large, high-quality dataset of 43 moderate-to-strong Japanese events, in the magnitude range between 4 and 9. We analyzed more than 7000 three-component waveforms recorded at 1,208 stations, spanning a wide distance range (0-500 km). We study the relationship between the time evolution of the peak displacement and the earthquake magnitude itself to investigate a possible different scaling for small and large events. For the analyzed earthquake set, we found that the initial evolution of peak displacement is different between small and large earthquakes. In particular, we show a rapid initial increase of the peak displacement for small events and a slower growth for larger ones. The figure shows the average values of P-wave peak displacement for some representative events while the insert box shows the expected initial slope of the curves for different magnitudes. This result suggests that the evolution of P-wave peak displacement holds information regarding the early stage of the rupture process and may be a proxy for the final size of the event. Our results indicate that earthquakes breaking in a region with a large critical slip displacement value have a larger probability to grow into a large size rupture than those originating in a region with a smaller critical displacement value.",

Wherever someone’s own location is, they can be automatically informed when an earthquake has struck just by setting a magnitude threshold and an area of interest. No need to browse the internet: the information reaches you automatically and instantaneously!\nOne question remains: are the provided earthquake notifications always relevant for the public? A while after damaging earthquakes many eyewitnesses scrap the application they installed just after the mainshock. Why? Because either the magnitude threshold is set too high and many felt earthquakes are missed, or it is set too low and the majority of the notifications are related to unfelt earthquakes thereby only increasing anxiety among the population at each new update.\nFelt and damaging earthquakes are the ones of societal importance even when of small magnitude. LastQuake app and Twitter feed (QuakeBot) focuses on these earthquakes that matter for the public by collating different information threads covering tsunamigenic, damaging and felt earthquakes.\nNon-seismic detections and macroseismic questionnaires collected online are combined to identify felt earthquakes regardless their magnitude. Non seismic detections include Twitter earthquake detections, developed by the USGS, where the number of tweets containing the keyword “earthquake” is monitored in real time and flashsourcing, developed by the EMSC, which detect traffic surges on its rapid earthquake information website caused by the natural convergence of eyewitnesses who rush to the Internet to investigate the cause of the shaking that they have just felt.\nWe will present the identification process of the felt earthquakes, the smartphone application and the 27 automatically generated tweets and how, by providing better public services, we collect more data from citizens.",

            "abstract": "The emission of Hg and H2S from natural and anthropogenic sources may have a great environmental impact in urban areas as well as in the surroundings of active and passive degassing volcanoes. Mercury is present in the atmosphere mainly in its elemental form (Hg0~98 %), which has a relatively high volatility, low solubility and chemical inertness. Hydrogen sulfide, one of the most abundant gas species in volcanic fluids, is highly poisoning and corrosive.\nIn this study, an innovative real-time method for the measurements of Hg0 and H2S concentrations in air was carried out at La Solfatara Crater, a hydrothermally altered tuff-cone nested in the town of Pozzuoli (Southern Italy), and at Mt. Amiata volcano (Central Italy), where a world-class Hg mining district abandoned in the seventies and a presently-exploited geothermal field for the production of electrical energy occur. The main aims were (i) to test this new methodological approach and (ii) to investigate Hg0 and H2S concentrations and the chemical-physical parameters regulating their spatial distribution in polluted areas.\nA portable Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometer with high frequency modulation of light polarization (Lumex RA-915M) was used in combination with a pulsed fluorescence gas analyzer (Thermo Scientific Model 450i) to measure Hg0 and H2S, respectively. The instruments were synchronized and set at high-frequency acquisition (10 sec and 1 min, respectively). Measurements were carried out along pathways (up to 12 km long) at an average speed of <10 km/h and coupled with GPS data and meteorological parameters. In selected sites, passive samplers were positioned to determine the time-integrated Hg0 and H2S concentrations to be compared with the real-time measurements.\nThe results indicate that this approach is highly efficient and effective in providing reliable and reproducible Hg0 and H2S concentrations and can be used to identify and characterize gas emitters in different environments.",

            "abstract": "The transport pathways of water beneath a glacier are subject to change as melt seasons progress due to variability in the balance between basal water pressure and water flux. Subglacial hydrology has been well studied, but the understanding of spatial distribution is less well constrained. Whereas radiogenic isotopic tracers have been traditionally used as proxies to track spatial variability and weathering rates in fluvial and riverine systems, these techniques have yet to be applied extensively to the subglacial environment and may help resolve ambiguity in subglacial hydrology. Research has shown the 143Nd/144Nd values can reflect variation in source provenance processes due to variations in the age of the continental crust. Correlating the 143Nd/144Nd with other radiogenic isotope systematics such as strontium (87Sr/86Sr) provides important constraints on the role of congruent and incongruent weathering processes. Our study presents the application of Nd and Sr systematics using isotopic ratios to the suspended load of subglacial meltwater collected over a single melt season at Lemon Creek Glacier, USA (LCG). The time-series data show an average εNd ~ -6.83, indicating a young bedrock (~60 MYA). Isotopic variation helps track the seasonal expansion of the subglacial meltwater channels and subsequent return to early season conditions due to the parabolic trend towards less radiogenic Nd in June and towards more radiogenic Nd beginning in mid-August. However, the high variability in July and early August may reflect a mixture of source as the channels diverge and derive sediment from differently aged lithologies. We find a poor correlation between 143Nd/144Nd and 87Sr/86Sr (R2= 0.38) along with a slight trend towards more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr values with time ((R2= 0.49). This may indicate that, even as the residence time decreases over the melt season, the LCG subglacial system is relatively stable and that the bedrock is congruently weathered. Our study suggests that the 143Nd/144Nd is a useful tool for tracking sediment source and hydrological dynamics in the subglacial environment.",

A mobile Picarro G2301 CRDS analyser was installed in a vehicle, together with an anemometer and a Hemisphere GPS receiver, to measure atmospheric methane mole fractions and their relative location. When methane plumes were located and intercepted, air samples were collected in Tedlar bags, for δ13C-CH4 isotopic analysis by CF-GC-IRMS (Continous Flow-Gas Chromatography-Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectroscopy). This method provides high precision isotopic values, determining δ13C-CH4 to ±0.05 per mil.\nThe bulk signature of the methane plume into the atmosphere from the whole source area was obtained by Keeling plot analysis, and a δ13C-CH4 signature, with the relative uncertainty, allocated to each methane source investigated. The averaged δ13C-CH4 signature for landfill sites around the London region is – 58 ± 3 ‰, whereas the δ13C-CH4 signature for gas leaks is fairly constant at -36 ± 2 ‰, a value characteristic of North Sea supply.\nThe Picarro G2301 analyser was installed also on the roof of King’s College London, located in the centre of the city, and connected to an air inlet located 7 meters above roof height. An auto-sampler was connected to the same air inlet and launched remotely when a high nocturnal build up was expected, allowing up to twenty air bags to be collected for methane isotopic analysis over a 24 hour period. The main source contributing to overnight methane build up in central London is fugitive gas, in agreement with inventories.\nFrom the isotopic characterisation of urban methane sources and the source mix in London, the contribution to the urban methane budget and the local distribution of the methane sources given in inventories can be validated.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater models are one of the main tools used in the hydrogeological sciences to assess resources and to simulate possible effects from future water demands and changes in climate. The hydrological inputs to groundwater models can be numerous and can vary in both time and space. Difficulties associated with model construction are often related to extensive datasets and cumbersome data processing tasks. To mitigate these difficulties, a graphical user interface (GUI) is often employed to aid the input of data for creating models. Unfortunately, GUI software presents an obstacle to reproducibility, a cornerstone of research. The considerable effort required to document processing steps in a GUI program, and the rapid obsoleteness of these steps with subsequent versions of the software, has prompted modelers to explicitly write down processing steps as source code to make them ‘easily’ reproducible.\nThis research describes the R package wrv, a collection of datasets and functions for pre- and post-processing the numerical groundwater flow model of the Wood River Valley aquifer system, south-central Idaho. R largely facilitates reproducible modeling with the package vignette; a document that is a combination of content and source code. The code is run when the vignette is built, and all data analysis output (such as figures and tables) is created on the fly and inserted into the final document. The wrv package includes two vignettes that explain and run steps that (1) create package datasets from raw data files located on a publicly accessible repository, and (2) create and run the groundwater flow model. MODFLOW-USG, the numerical groundwater model used in this study, is executed from the vignette, and model output is returned for exploratory analyses. The ability of R to perform all processing steps in a single workflow is attributed to its comprehensive list of features; that include geographic information system and time series functionality.",

            "abstract": "TEX86, calculated based on the distribution of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) from planktonic Thaumarchaeota, is widely used for paleo sea surface temperature reconstruction. Although increasing evidence shows that TEX86 can be affected by multiple environmental variables, little is known about the additional contribution of TEX86-related GDGTs from other planktonic archaeal groups. In this study, we test the hypothesis that GDGTs potentially derived from MG II Archaea affect TEX86 calculations. Analysis of core (C) and intact polar (IP) GDGTs and 454 sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting MG II were performed on suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected along a salinity gradient from the lower Pearl River, its estuary, and the northern South China Sea. The results showed that the community structure varied along the salinity gradient with MG II as the second dominant group in the mixing water and seawater. qPCR data indicated that the abundance of MG II in the mixing water was four to five orders of magnitudes higher than the fresh water and seawater. The Ring Index of archaeal lipids was notably elevated in the Pearl River estuary, which may be attributed to the additional export of cyclopentane moiety-enhanced GDGTs from MG II in the mixing water. Furthermore, a linear correlation was observed between qPCR of MG II and IP-GDGTs derived from phosphate head groups, suggesting that MG II actively produces GDGTs in the water column. These results show strong evidence that MG II synthesizes GDGTs with more cyclopentane moieties, which may bias TEX86 signal derived from GDGTs of Thaumarchaeota. This study highlights that valid interpretation of TEX86 in the geologic record, particularly in coastal oceans, needs to consider the paleo-community structure of planktonic Archaea.",

Using integrated radiogenic isotopic data, petrologic modeling, and regional geomorphology, we determine source domains, melting conditions, and regional implications. Modeling of the melting conditions on primitive basalts yielded an average temperature and pressure of 1412±25°C and 2.32±0.31 GPa, corresponding to a mantle potential temperature of ~1410°C, suggesting melting conditions slightly higher than ambient mantle but not as high as expected from plume activity. When compared with magmas from Atlantic hotspots, the Eocene ENAM samples share isotopic signatures with the Azores and Cape Verde. This similarity suggests the possibility of a large-scale dissemination of similar sources in the upper mantle left over from the opening of the Atlantic. Asthenosphere upwelling related to localized lithospheric delamination is a possible process that can explain the intraplate signature of these magmas that lack evidence of a thermal anomaly. This process can also explain the Cenozoic dynamic topography and rejuvenation of the Central Appalachians. New P- and S-wave tomography using data from EarthScope’s USArray shows that a low-velocity anomaly persists in the upper mantle beneath the Eocene volcanic swarm, indicating that the magmatic event substantially modified regional lithospheric structure. Our geochemical and petrologic constraints will be vital for a comprehensive interpretation of new geophysical data emerging from EarthScope and understanding its implications for the geological evolution of ENAM.",

Inter-seismic upper plate deformation of this part of the subduction zone remains poorly constrained due to lack of availability of spatially well distributed data. Through this study we are reanalyzing the available GPS geodetic data sets collected by various agencies over different times between 1996-2004 to constrain the pre-earthquake convergence values using a consistent reference frame to determine the crustal deformation in the Andaman Nicobar region, to infer strain rates in the overriding plate, how Andaman microplate was moving relative to Indian plate and what was the extent of plate locking. We will also discuss the details on spatial and temporal variations of convergence rates and variations in plate coupling. To quantify the change in coupling, we calculated the interseismic surface deformation using Okada's formulation, in which locked faults are modelled as dislocations in a halfspace. We defined the subduction zone geometry as three elastically deforming blocks (India, Andaman fore-arc, and Sunda) separated by two faults: the West Andaman Fault and the Sumatra-Andaman megathrust. The bennioff-zone dip and orientation is re-defined using the recently relocated epicentral solutions with higher accuracy and from the slip-distribution models constrained from the various co-seismic geodetic offsets reported from the near-field and far-field GPS sites . The rigid-body motion of each block is specified by a pole of rotation. We modelled the variation in coupling by specifying for each node and integrating the slip deficit over the fault surfaces. The West Andaman Fault is modeled as a vertical strike- lip fault, locked to a depth of ~20 km, with a dextral slip.",

The full impact of the phase transition has enfolded over subsequent years, as experimental and theoretical studies have provided information on the physical properties of the perovskite and post-perovskite phases.

            "abstract": "Drawing down carbon from the atmosphere happens in the oceans when marine plants are growing due to the use of carbon dioxide for biological processes and by raising the pH of the water. Macro- and microscopic marine photosynthesizers are limited in their growth by the availability of light and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, etc.) Deep ocean water (DOW), oceanic water from bellow about 1000m, is a natural medium for marine algae, which contains all (except in rare circumstances) necessary components for algal growth and represents over 90% of the volume of the ocean. The introduction of DOW to a tropical or summer sea can increase chlorophyll from near zero to 60 mg per M3 or more.\nThe form of the utilization infrastructure for DOW can roughly be divided into two effective types; the unconstrained release and the open pond system. Unconstrained release has the advantage of having relatively low infrastructure investment and is available to any area of the ocean. The open pond system has high infrastructure costs but enables intensive use of DOW for harvesting macro- and microalgae and sustainable mariculture. It also enables greater concomitant production of DOW's other potential products such as electricity or potable water. However, unlike an unconstrained release the open pond system can capture much of the biomaterial from the water and limits the impact to the surrounding ecosystem.\nThe Tidal Irrigation and Electrical System (TIESystem), is an open pond that is to be constructed on a continental shelf. It harnesses the tidal flux to pump DOW into the pond on the rising tide and then uses the falling tide to pump biologically rich material out of the pond. This biomaterial represents fixed CO2 and can be used for biofuel or fertilizers. The TIESystem benefits from an economy of scale that increases at a rate that is roughly equal to the relationship of the circumference of a circle (the barrier that creates the open pond) to the area of the pond multiplied by the tidal flux on that particular area of the continental shelf. Despite the large construction costs of artificial islands and structures robust enough to withstand the conditions of the continental shelf, the system will become economic as it grows in size. However, extensive research will be required to maximize the output of each subsystem and minimize the risk of pollution.",

Until now, most observations of He+ pickup ions were limited to reduced 1D velocity spectra, which are insufficient to study certain characteristics of the He+ Velocity Distribution Function (VDF). It is generally assumed that rapid pitch-angle scattering of freshly created pickup ions quickly leads to a fully isotropic He+ VDF. In the light of recent observations, this assumption has found to be oversimplified and needs to be re-investigated.\nUsing He+ pickup ion data from the PLASTIC instrument on board the STEREO A spacecraft we reconstruct a reduced form of the He+ VDF in 2 dimensions (see figure). The reduced form of the He+ VDF allows us to study the pitch-angle distribution and anisotropy of the He+ VDF as a function of the solar magnetic field, B. Our observations show clear signs of a significant anisotropy of the He+ VDF and even indicates that, at least for certain configurations of B, it is not even fully gyrotropic. Our results further suggest, that the observed velocity and pitch-angle of He+ depends strongly on the solar magnetic field vector, B, the ecliptic longitude, λ\u0015, the solar wind speed, vsw, and the history of B.\nConsequently, we argue that reduced 1D velocity spectra of He+ are insuffi\u000ecient to study quantities like the pitch-angle scattering rate, τ, or the adiabatic cooling index γ.",

            "abstract": "Critical Zone (CZ) science includes the study of the inter-related chemical, physical, and biological processes happening at the earth surface. CZ science differs from watershed science or other similar initiatives in that it not only incorporates many disciplinary approaches and crosses spatial scales, but it also aims to understand processes occurring at timescales varying from those characterizing fast chemical reactions to the slow responses of surficial systems to tectonic change. Isotope systems are an important tool that can be used to assess processes at different timescales. Some isotopic systems are used as chronometers. Synthesizing isotopic data from different elemental systems to understand processes as complex as weathering at a ridgetop, hillslope transformation, or watershed evolution is a difficult task but is essential toward deciphering the complex coupling that characterizes surficial systems.\nA good example where isotopes are elucidating CZ processes is the analysis of weathering at ridgetops, along hillslopes, and in watersheds. Targetting these three types of study sites at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, we have used Mg, Fe, Li, Ca, Be, Sr, U and other isotopes to understand the effects of weathering in one-dimension (1D), 2D and 3D, respectively. Some of the systems such as Fe yield information about elemental losses due to biogeochemical weathering. Other isotopes such as U yield information about the development of particles from bedrock. In this talk I will synthesize data from many different researchers working at the CZO to show how disparate isotopic data for one set of sites can answer questions of how landforms develop and change. This effort to use many isotopes on the same CZ setting -- which we call \"CZ-tope\" science -- requires sharing of sites, samples, and data in team research. CZ-tope science delineates which processes control which features at each timescale of interest.",

These models also assume that the ground-motion variability observed in a global dataset is the same as the variability in ground motion at a single site-source combination. This assumption is referred to as the ergodic assumption.\nNew data give a unique opportunity to remove the ergodic assumption and take into account regional source, path and site specificities. Using recent data analysis performed on the EUROSEISTEST valley (Greece) and global ground-motion datasets (Kiknet, Knet, NGA2 and the European strong-motion databases) we will show the impact of source parameters, site monitoring and site-characterisation on the uncertainty of the ground motion estimates and associated hazard curves.\nOur results suggest that future strong-motion networks should use higher sampling rates (to better evaluate site-specific high frequency attenuations) and record both strong and weak motions (to evaluate single-station sigma). These results also quantify the impact of a better characterisation of source parameters (depth, fault maturity, source to site distances) ans site parameters on ground-motion models.\nWe finally will show how new networks and high-level strong-motion databases may help to built consistent ergodic PSHA at a regional scale and non-ergodic, site specific,  PSHA.",

            "abstract": "Reducing modeling error is often a major concern of empirical geophysical models. However, modeling errors can be defined in different ways: When the response variable is continuous, the most commonly used metrics are squared (SQ) and absolute (ABS) errors. For most applications, ABS error is the more natural, but SQ error is mathematically more tractable, so is often used as a substitute with little scientific justification. Existing literature has not thoroughly investigated the implications of using SQ error in place of ABS error, especially not geospatially. This study compares the two metrics through the lens of bias-variance decomposition (BVD). BVD breaks down the expected modeling error of each model evaluation point into bias (systematic error), variance (model sensitivity), and noise (observation instability). It offers a way to probe the composition of various error metrics. I analytically derived the BVD of ABS error and compared it with the well-known SQ error BVD, and found that not only the two metrics measure the characteristics of the probability distributions of modeling errors differently, but also the effects of these characteristics on the overall expected error are different. Most notably, under SQ error all bias, variance, and noise increase expected error, while under ABS error certain parts of the error components reduce expected error. Since manipulating these subtractive terms is a legitimate way to reduce expected modeling error, SQ error can never capture the complete story embedded in ABS error. I then empirically compared the two metrics with a supervised remote sensing model for mapping surface imperviousness. Pair-wise spatially-explicit comparison for each error component showed that SQ error overstates all error components in comparison to ABS error, especially variance-related terms. Hence, substituting ABS error with SQ error makes model performance appear worse than it actually is, and the analyst would more likely accept a model with higher bias but more stability. Further, my experiments showed that the two metrics can and will lead to different conclusions about the impacts of certain operations and may suggest different strategies for model improvement. Therefore, SQ error is a poor substitute for ABS error, and the use of the two metrics should be clearly differentiated.",

The main public concern associated with hydraulic fracturing of Marcellus shale is that that the quality of underground sources of drinking water (USDW) and surface waters can be compromised due to well casing or grouting failures, creation of new fracture pathways, and improper disposal of produced water. However, this region has a long history of coal mining and oil /gas development and therefore it becomes very important to be able to distinguish if any incidence of water contamination is associated with legacy mining/drilling activities or the newly drilled shale gas wells. In addition, the complex structural regime of the Appalachian makes it difficult to decouple natural migration of deep brines and stray gas along geological faults/ fractures from new pathways created by hydraulic fracturing activities. In order to effectively assess the effect of shale gas development on water quality of this region there is a need 1) to establish the background geochemical signatures of different water sources and, 2) to develop geochemical fingerprints that can track the sources and fates of brines and stray gas in fresh waters. We will present results from several ongoing research projects which demonstrate applicability of stable isotopes as natural tracers to understand changes in hydrologic connections associated with shale gas drilling in this region.",

Sediment budget analyses suggest that Ls is 1-100 km in the mid-Atlantic region, while T may be ~103 years, such that particles move 3-5 orders of magnitude slower than the water in the channel. Given the well-known inaccuracy of sediment budgets, independent verification from a tracer study would be desirable. Here, an historic industrial release of mercury is interpreted as a decadal sediment tracer experiment, releasing sediment particles “tagged” with mercury that are deposited on floodplains. As expected, floodplain mercury inventories decrease exponentially downstream, with a characteristic decay length of 10 km (95% confidence interval: 5-25 km) that defines the distance suspended particles typically move downstream before entering storage. Floodplain mercury inventories are not significantly different above and below three colonial age mill dams (present at the time of mercury release but now breached), suggesting that these results reflect ongoing processes. Suspended sediment routing models that neglect long-term storage, and the watershed management plans based on them, may need revision.",

            "abstract": "In the present study we observationally address the role of ionospheric conductivity in the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling in terms of global field-aligned currents (FACs). Solar EUV irradiance changes during a solar cycle, and so does its contribution to the ionospheric conductivity. We statistically examine how, under fixed external conditions, the intensities of the R1 and R2 currents and their demarcation latitude depend on solar activity (F10.7). An emphasis is placed on nightside FACs in the dark hemisphere. The result shows that for fixed ranges of interplanetary electric field, the nightside FACs are more intense for higher solar activity irrespective of their polarities or local times. It is also found that the R1-R2 pair, therefore the auroral oval, moves equatorward as the solar activity increases. For both current intensity and latitude, the dependence on F10.7 is more sensitive at smaller F10.7 and it levels off with increasing F10.7. The intensities of dayside FACs reveal similar F10.7 dependence as expected from the enhancement of the local ionospheric conductance. Interestingly, they also move equatorward with increasing solar activity. It is expected from force balance that as the dayside R1 current becomes more intense with increasing solar activity, the magnetosphere shrinks on the day side and expands on the night side. This configurational change of the magnetosphere presumably affects the energy transport from the solar wind to the magnetosphere, although its details still remain to be understood. We conclude that the ionospheric conductivity actively affects the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "Climate-change-induced trends towards shrub dominance in subarctic, moss-dominated peatlands will most likely have large effects on soil carbon (C) dynamics through an input of more easily decomposable litter. The mechanisms by which this increase in vascular litter input interacts with the abundance and diet-choice of the decomposer community to alter C-processing have, however, not yet been unraveled. We used a novel 13C tracer approach to link invertebrate species composition (Collembola), abundance and species-specific feeding behavior to C-processing of vascular and peat moss litters. We incubated different litter mixtures, 100% Sphagnum moss litter, 100% Betula leaf litter, and a 50/50 mixture of both, in mesocosms for 406 days. We revealed the transfer of C from the litters to the soil invertebrate species by 13C labeling of each of the litter types and assessed 13C signatures of the invertebrates\nCollembola species composition differed significantly between Sphagnum and Betula litter. Within the ‘single type litter’ mesocosms, Collembola species showed different 13C signatures, implying species-specific differences in diet choice. Surprisingly, the species composition and Collembola abundance changed relatively little as a consequence of Betula input to a Sphagnum based system. Their diet choice, however, changed drastically; species-specific differences in diet choice disappeared and approximately 67% of the food ingested by all Collembola originated from Betula litter. Furthermore, litter decomposition patterns corresponded to these findings; mass loss of Betula increased from 16.1% to 26.2% when decomposing in combination with Sphagnum, while Sphagnum decomposed even slower in combination with Betula litter (1.9%) than alone (4.7%).\nThis study is the first to empirically show that collective diet shifts of the peatland decomposer community from mosses towards vascular plant litter may drive altered decomposition patterns. In addition, we showed that although species-specific differences in Collembola feeding behavior appear to exist, species are very plastic in their diet. This implies that changes in C turnover rates with vegetation shifts, might well be due to diet shifts of the present decomposer community rather than by changes in species composition.",

            "abstract": "In Oregon’s Central Coast Range (OCR), dissolved O2 concentrations in at least 10% of stream length frequently dip below state standards set to ensure survival and reproduction of native salmonids. We examined O2 dynamics on 12 OCR rivers during times of the year when standards had been violated. Continuous dissolved O2 data were collected 15 minutes apart over a 24-hour period during spring (May - June) or fall (September - November) 2008 on each river. We modeled O2 dynamics for each river with parameters describing O2 exchange with the atmosphere, production of O2 from gross primary production (GPP), and consumption of O2 by ecosystem respiration (ER) fit to observed data. Average nighttime atmospheric O2 exchange and ER were estimated by regressing interval changes in dissolved O2 concentrations between measurements with corresponding O2 saturation deficits. GPP for each daytime sampling interval was calculated as the difference between O2 saturation deficit and the sum of temperature-corrected reaeration and ecosystem respiration. All regression models developed for estimating night-time reaeration and ER were highly significant (p<0.03; adjusted r2=0.17 - 0.77). GPP ranged from 0.62 to 14.95 mg O2 L-1 d-1, ER ranged from -1.21 mg O2 L-1 d-1, and net daily metabolism (NDM; net O2 flux controlled by biological processes) ranged from -11.64 to 3.75 mg O2 L-1 d-1 across all rivers and seasons. Increased aquatic productivity resulting from adjacent and upstream human activities likely altered dissolved O2 dynamics in these rivers. Through scenario analysis, we found that at one river (Alsea), GPP and ER would need to be reduced by 85 and 73%, respectively, to meet the state standard (95% saturation). Our modeling approach can be connected with management actions across a variety of spatial and temporal scales, ranging from local, riparian-scale manipulations of shading and organic matter input to watershed and regional nutrient and temperature management.",

Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 targeted the glacial dynamics of the NCIS in the coastal St. Elias range. Sediment cores from Site U1419 encompass times of global ice advance and retreat from MIS 3 to the present, based on a preliminary age model with 5-kya resolution developed using oxygen isotopes from benthic and planktonic foraminifera and stratigraphic correlation with a previously C-14 dated site survey core (Davies et al., 2011; doi:10.1029/2010PA002051). CT images of cores were used to identify sedimentary facies and relative ice sheet proximity. Six sedimentary facies were identified in the images; massive mud with and without lonestones, laminations with and without lonestones, massive and stratified diamict (>1 clast/cm). Elemental scanning XRF data were used to delineate possible downcore changes in sediment provenance using provenance-sensitive transition metals. Diamict and gravelly mud are the most common facies, indicative of persistent glacial input interpreted as marine-terminating glacial systems. Stratified diamicts are interpreted as periods of maximum ice extent (~18-20 ka), whereas massive mud (~14 ka-present) suggests terminus retreat. Intervals of laminated mud with and without lonestones are interpreted as periods of reduced ice cover, with the most recent (~14.5 kya) coinciding with the Bølling Interstade of northern Europe/Greenland (Davies et al., 2011). Downcore changes in Al-normalized metal XRF counts vary along with sedimentary lithoficies, suggesting changes in sediment provenance that may be related to the quantity of glacigenic sediment delivery to this location.",

            "abstract": "The Atlas Mountains of Morocco have unusually high topography, with no apparent deep crustal root, and regions of localized Cenozoic alkaline volcanism. Previous seismic imaging and geophysical studies have implied a hot mantle upwelling as the source of the volcanism and high elevation, but the existence and physical properties of such an upwelling are debated. Recent temporary deployments of over 100 broadband seismometers that extended across Morocco as part of the PICASSO, Morocco-Münster, and IberArray experiments along with select permanent stations have provided a dataset to image the detailed mantle and lithospheric structure beneath the Atlas. We present results from S receiver functions (SRF), shear wave splitting, waveform modeling, and geodynamic models that help constrain the tectonic evolution of the Atlas and the localized alkaline volcanism. The receiver functions show that the lithosphere is thin (~65 km) beneath the Atlas, but thickens (~105 km) over a very short length scale at the flanks of the mountains and near the Quaternary volcanoes. These changes in lithospheric thickness also correspond to dramatic decreases in delay times inferred from S and SKS splitting observations. SRFs also indicate a broad, low seismic velocity anomaly (~150 km) below the shallow lithosphere that extends along much of the Atlas and beneath the Anti-Atlas and correlates with the location of Pliocene-Quaternary magmatism. Waveform analysis from the linear array across the Middle and High Atlas constrains the position, shape, and physical characteristics of a localized, low velocity conduit that extends up from the uppermost mantle (~200 km). The shape, position and temperature of the imaged low velocity anomaly, offsets in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, and correlation with mantle flow inferred from shear wave splitting suggest that the unusually high topography of the Atlas Mountains is due to active mantle support.",

            "abstract": "Comparisons of the land required for different types of energy are challenging due to the fact that upstream land use of fossil fuel technologies is not well characterized. This research focuses on improving estimates of the life cycle land use of natural gas-fired electricity through the novel combination of inventories of the location of natural gas-related infrastructure, satellite imagery analysis and gas production data. Land area per unit generation is calculated as the sum of natural gas life cycle stages divided by the throughput of natural gas, combined with the land use of the power plant divided by the generation of the power plant. Five natural gas life cycle stages are evaluated for their area: production, gathering, processing, transmission and disposal. The power plant stage is characterized by a thermal efficiency ηth, which converts MegaJoules (MJ) to kilowatt hours (kWh).\nWe focus on seven counties in the Barnett shale region in Texas that represent over 90% of total Barnett Shale gas production. In addition to assessing the gathering and transmission pipeline network, approximately 500 sites are evaluated from the five life cycle stages plus power plants. For instance, assuming a 50 foot right-of-way for transmission pipelines, this part of the Barnett pipeline network occupies nearly 26,000 acres. Site, road and water components to total area are categorized. Methods are developed to scale up sampled results for each component type to the full population of sites within the Barnett. Uncertainty and variability are charaterized.\nWell-level production data are examined by integrating commercial datasets with advanced methods for quantifying estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for wells, then summed to estimate natural gas produced in an entire play. Wells that are spatially coincident are merged using ArcGIS. All other sites are normalized by an estimate of gas throughput. Prior land use estimates are used to validate the satellite imagery analysis. Results of this research will provide a step towards better quantifying the land footprint of energy production activities and a methodologically consistent baseline from which more robust comparisons with alternative energy choices can be made.",

            "abstract": "According to the hypothesis of polar synchronization, climate variations of Earth’s poles are connected with a persistent phase lock of π/2 throughout the last glacial period. However, it is not clear yet how the Earth’s two poles communicate with each other, the Thermohaline circulation (THC) being a possible candidate for signal carrier. Here we present a possible way of climate variation propagation through the Atlantic Ocean - likely in the form of heat or thermal wave (Cattaneo’s solution) - based on lagged correlation between an organic carbon climate proxy record from the tropical Atlantic and the south-north polar temperature gradient. We further demonstrate that the speed of such propagation is frequency dependent, of which the wave of the longest period travels the fastest at the speed of ~32 km/year consistent with the estimated speed of the THC. The observed speed – frequency relationship can be successfully modeled as resulting from a propagating dispersive thermal wave initiated by the polar temperature gradient maximum. We show that such heat wave propagation is a potential mechanism to couple and synchronize the polar climates during the last glacial period and to force the occurrence of Heinrich events. To summarize, the polar temperature gradient anomalies are consequence of the π/2 phase lock between the polar climates, which is caused by polar synchronization maintained by the coupling, which is, as the data suggest, in the form of thermal waves. The spikes in organic carbon and the Fe/Ca ratio records in the core GeoB3912-1 can be thought of as snapshots of the passage of strong meteorological wavefronts through the equatorial region. The results strongly suggest that each peak in the organic carbon recorded a half-hemisphere-delayed passage of a wave-like disturbance through the equator carrying the south-north temperature gradient maxima. And each of these occurs within timing error of the Heinrich events H0-H6.",

            "abstract": "Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are common in peat, soil, lakes, rivers and hot springs. To seek the potential biological sources of brGDGTs in geothermal environments, we investigated 65 hot springs in the Yellowstone National Park (USA) and Tengchong (China). Together with previously published data from hot springs in the Great Basin (USA) and Tibet (China), we found that the abundance of brGDGTs tended to peak in springs with pH > 8. This contrasts with previous observations indicating an abundance of brGDGTs in acidic soils and peat bogs, suggesting a different biological source and function for lipids in these environments. In support of this hypothesis, a comparison of Cyclization ratios of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) between hot springs and surrounding soils indicated that more brGDGTs with cyclopentane moieties were produced in alkaline hot springs than in nearby low-temperature soils. Since Acidobacteria (the likely source of brGDGTs in peat bog environments) tend to have low CBT ratios, these data suggest a different source for brGDGTs in hot spring environments. RDA and regression analysis integrating brGDGT compounds and nitrogen species indicate that Bacteria involved in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle (ammonia oxidation and nitrite reduction) may be related to the production of brGDGTs in terrestrial hot springs. However, direct evidence showing the link between nitrogen-cycling bacteria and brGDGT production has yet to be demonstrated under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, our study expands the possibility of brGDGT sources into bacterial communities in terrestrial geothermal systems where Acidobacteria are absent or only a minor component.",

            "abstract": "The response of mineral phases to the radiation fields that will be experienced in a geological disposal facility (GDF) for nuclear waste is poorly understood. Phyllosilicates are critical phases in a GDF with bentonite clay as the backfill of choice surrounding high level wastes in the engineered barrier, and clays and micas forming the most important reactive component of potential host rocks. It is essential that we understand changes in mineral properties and behaviour as a result of damage from both α and γ radiation over long timescales. Radiation damage has been demonstrated to affect the physical integrity and oxidation state1 of minerals which will also influence their ability to react with radionuclides. Using the University of Manchester’s newly commissioned particle accelerator at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility, UK, model phyllosilicate minerals (e.g. biotite, chlorite) were irradiated with high energy (5MeV) alpha particles at controlled dose rates. This has been compared alongside radiation damage found in naturally formed ‘radiohalos’ – spherical areas of discolouration in minerals surrounding radioactive inclusions, resulting from alpha particle penetration, providing a natural analogue to study lattice damage under long term bombardment1,2. Both natural and artificially irradiated samples have been analysed using microfocus X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high resolution X-ray diffraction mapping on Beamline I18 at Diamond Light Source; samples were probed for redox changes and long/short range disorder. This was combined with lattice scale imaging of damage using HR-TEM (TitanTM Transmission Electron Microscope). The results show aberrations in lattice parameters as a result of irradiation, with multiple damage-induced ‘domains’ surrounded by amorphous regions. In the naturally damaged samples, neo-formed phyllosilicate phases are shown to be breakdown products of highly damaged regions. A clear reduction of the Fe(III) component has been demonstrated in iron-bearing phyllosilicates in both naturally and artificially damaged samples. Alterations in mineral structure and chemistry will have implications for the phases’ efficiency as a barrier material.\n1. Pattrick, R A D et al., (2013) Min. Mag., 77, 2867–2882. 2.

Lightning has now been documented at 154 volcanoes in association with over 400 eruptions, a significant increase from the earlier numbers of 89 volcanoes and 240 eruptions. Lightning and electrification at volcanoes are important because they represent a hazard in their own right, they are a component of the global electrical circuit, and because they contribute to ash particle aggregation and modification within ash plumes. The role of water substance (water in all forms) in particular has not been well studied. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was determined for 177 eruptions. Eight percent of VEI=3-5 eruptions have reported lightning, and 10 percent of VEI=6, but less than 2 percent of those with VEI=1-2, suggesting consistent reporting for larger eruptions but either less lightning or under-reporting for small eruptions. Ash plume heights (142 observations) show a bimodal distribution with peaks at 7-12 km and 1-4 km. The former are similar to heights of typical thunderstorms and suggest involvement of water substance, whereas the latter suggest other factors contributing to electrical behavior near the vent. The distributions of the latitudes of volcanoes with lightning and eruptions with lightning roughly mimic the distribution of all volcanoes; flat with latitude. Meteorological lightning, on the other hand, is common in the tropics and decreases markedly with increasing latitude as the ability of the atmosphere to hold water decreases poleward. This finding supports the idea that if lightning in large eruptions depends on water substance, then the origin of the water is primarily magma and not entrainment from the surrounding atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Herein we present three recent oceanographic studies performed in the Adriatic Sea (the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea), where Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method, an unsupervised neural network method capable of recognizing patterns in various types of datasets, was applied to environmental data. The first study applied the SOM method to a long (50 years) series of thermohaline, dissolved oxygen and nutrient data measured over a deep (1200 m) Southern Adriatic Pit, in order to extract characteristic deep water mass patterns and their temporal variability. Low-dimensional SOM solutions revealed that the patterns were not sensitive to nutrients but were determined mostly by temperature, salinity and DO content; therefore, the water masses in the region can be traced by using no nutrient data. The second study encompassed the classification of surface current patterns measured by HF radars over the northernmost part of the Adriatic, by applying the SOM method to the HF radar data and operational mesoscale meteorological model surface wind fields. The major output from this study was a high correlation found between characteristic ocean current distribution patterns with and without wind data introduced to the SOM, implying the dominant wind driven dynamics over a local scale. That nominates the SOM method as a basis for generating very fast real-time forecast models over limited domains, based on the existing atmospheric forecasts and basin-oriented ocean experiments. The last study classified the sea ambient noise distributions in a habitat area of bottlenose dolphin, connecting it to the man-made noise generated by different types of vessels. Altogether, the usefulness of the SOM method has been recognized in different aspects of basin-scale ocean environmental studies, and may be a useful tool in future investigations of understanding of the multi-disciplinary dynamics over a basin, including the creation of operational environmental forecasting systems.",

The motivation of our work is the recent application of phase sensitive radar which measures the vertical velocity of an ice column. The velocity is dependent on the history of subsequent snow accumulation, compaction and compression; and it can be incorporated to the inverse problem in order to reduce the uncertainty introduced by ice flow modelling.We first apply our method to synthetic data in order to study its capability and the effect of noise and gaps in the data on retrieved accumulation history. The method is then applied to the ice core retrieved from James Ross Island, Antarctica. We show that the method is robust and that the results depend on quality of the age-depth observations and the derived flow regime around the core site.The method facilitates the incorporation of increasing detail provided by ice-core analysis together with observed full-depth velocity in order to construct a complete climatic record of the polar regions.",

            "abstract": "To date, the key drivers behind the recent observed increase in organic carbon (OC) concentrations in surface waters are still controversial. The lack of long-term monitoring data – over centuries and millennia – leaves us with an ambiguous understanding of the past trajectory of OC concentrations in surface waters, and inhibits a better mechanistic understanding of past and a reliable prediction of future changes in OC levels.\nBy using a paleolimnological approach, we reconstructed past lake-water total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in lakes across the boreal landscape of central Sweden. Reconstructions are based on a transfer function between visible near-infrared spectra of surface sediments and the corresponding TOC concentration in the water column. Potential drivers behind changes in TOC were determined by a multi-proxy analysis of one of the studied lake sediment records including organic and inorganic geochemistry as well as biological proxies (pollen, diatoms).\nOur results show a significant decrease in lake-water TOC beginning already ~550 years ago. This decline continued until the mid-20th century when TOC concentrations started to increase again. These dynamics in TOC coincide with changes in proxies indicating catchment disturbance by human activities. The chronology of these changes corresponds to the expansion and decline of a landscape-wide system of summer forest grazing and farming in central Sweden from the 15th century to the turn of the 20th century. Frequent grazing and exploitation of forests and mires reduce aboveground vegetation and physically disturb soils. This further affects the carbon cycling by enhancing carbon turnover, reducing the thickness of organic soils and consequently altering the transport of OC from the catchment to lakes.\nOur findings suggest that recent changes in lake-water TOC in Sweden are strongly associated with historical patterns in land use and not only on-going changes in climate or sulfur deposition.",

These processes depend on the heterogeneity of the land-surface pattern. To study the influence of heterogeneity following questions arise: Which aspects of heterogeneity are important for the atmosphere, and to what extend is the information about the heterogeneity transferred from the surface to higher air layers? To investigate these questions via numerical simulations, it is necessary to describe heterogeneous pattern with metrics and methods. Many indices have been developed which can be applied to any categorized pattern. This presentation gives an overview about metrics describing the main aspects of heterogeneity. The aspects are the information, connectivity, structure, contrast, and anisotropy of a pattern. In addition to this overview, some applications of these metrics are presented to illustrate their performance on both land-surface patterns and the response of the atmosphere to these patterns.",

            "abstract": "The forests-savanna advancement/retraction process seems to play an important role in the global carbon cycle and in the climate-vegetation balance maintenance in the Amazon. To contribute with long term carbon dynamics and assess effectiveness of a protected area in reduce carbon emissions in Brazilian Amazon transitional areas, variations in forest-savanna mosaics biomass and carbon stock within Maraca Ecological Station (MES), Roraima/Brazil, and its outskirts non-protected areas were compared. Composite surface soil samples and indirect methods based on regression models were used to estimate aboveground tree biomass accumulation and assess vegetation and soil carbon stock along eleven 0.6 ha transects perpendicular to the forest-savanna limits. Aboveground biomass and carbon accumulation were influenced by vegetation structure, showing higher values within protected area, with great contribution of trees above 40 cm in diameter. In the savanna environments of protected areas, a higher tree density and carbon stock up to 30 m from the border confirmed a forest encroachment. This pointed that MES acts as carbon sink, even under variations in soil fertility gradient, with a potential increase of the total carbon stock from 9 to 150 Mg C ha-1. Under 20 years of fire and disturbance management, the results indicated the effectiveness of this protected area to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate greenhouse and climate change effects in a forest-savanna transitional area in Brazilian Northern Amazon. The contribution of this study in understanding rates and reasons for biomass and carbon variation, under different management strategies, should be considered the first approximation to assist policies of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) from underresearched Amazonian ecotone; despite further efforts in this direction are still needed.

IU stations (CASY, DAV, KIP, KONO, WCI), IC stations (SSE, XAN), and II stations (ALE, DGAR, RPN) were analyzed using a scaling analysis based on data-synthetic comparisons, evaluation of noise levels, assessment of inter-sensor coherence, and polarization analysis. These reports (available from\nhttp://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~ekstrom/Projects/WQC.html\n) highlighted a number of significant problems in GSN data quality, including the frequency-dependent loss of gain in the STS-1 seismometer (Ekström et al., 2006) that has been attributed to the presence of humidity in the electronics, cables, and connectors (Yuki and Ishihara, 2002; Hutt and Ringler, 2011).\nThe reports from the WQC spurred a number of changes in the operation of the GSN, including the adoption of the policy of annual calibrations and the development of new tools and metrics to monitor, evaluate, and communicate data quality. In parallel, the USGS’ Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL) and UCSD’s Project IDA worked with the IRIS Consortium to upgrade GSN stations with new data acquisition systems, to refurbish the STS-1 seismometers with new electronics, and to expand the deployment of secondary broadband sensors.\nWe revisit the 2010 reports, using the tools of the WQC as well as a number of newly developed tools such as the USGS’ Data Quality Analyzer and IRIS’ MUSTANG, and provide an update on GSN data quality. Our initial focus is on CASY and KIP, the first two stations reviewed by the WQC.

            "abstract": "Glacial pCO2 levels were lower than interglacial ones and the Deep Ocean is a strong candidate for storing the excess interglacial CO2. There are two main hypotheses about the glacial storage of atmospheric CO2 in the Deep Ocean and subsequent deglacial outgas/release of CO2 to the atmosphere: i) CO2 was stored in the Southern Ocean and was ventilated through the Antarctic Intermediate (AAIW) and Equatorial Intermediate Waters (EqIW); ii) CO2 was stored in the Deep Pacific and was ventilated through other intermediate waters. A mélange of all these intermediate waters is found in the western equatorial Pacific above the Pacific Deep Water (PDW) converting the region in an ideal setting to investigate these hypotheses.\nDuring RV Sonne Expedition SO228, sea water samples and sediment cores were retrieved off Mindanao and Papua New Guinea at various water depths. Here we present hydrographic and sedimentary data from key locations. CTD temperature, salinity and oxygen as well as seawater δ13C, δ18O and δD from various stations enable to study the modern oceanography in the region. The data allows the identification of various types of intermediate and deep waters and a characterization of water properties that can be used to study these water masses back in time using the sediment cores. The paleoceanographic study will focus on the last 25 kyrs and use benthic stable isotopes and paired planktonic-benthic foraminiferal radiocarbon measurements on two sediment cores off Mindanao at 404 and 848 m water depth and four cores off Papua New Guinea at 845, 1365, 1887 and 2210 m water depth. Preliminary radiocarbon-based age models indicate varying sedimentation rates from 2 to 30 cm/ka for the cores, higher off Mindanao than off Papua New Guinea. The benthic foraminiferal assemblage of the intermediate core at 845 m water depth provides initial indications of shifting water properties at intermediate levels, potentially connected to the inflow of well versus poor ventilated waters, thus encouraging the contention that poorly ventilated deep waters may have been upwelled to these depths.",

            "abstract": "All of the mysterious albedo features on the Moon called “lunar swirls” are associated with magnetic anomalies, but not all magnetic anomalies are associated with lunar swirls [1]. It is often hypothesized that the albedo markings are tied to immature regolith on the surface, perhaps due to magnetic shielding of the solar wind and prevention of normal space weathering of the soil. Although interaction of the solar wind with the surface at swirls is indeed affected by the local magnetic field [2], this does not appear to result in immature soils on the surface. Calibrated spectra from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper [M3] (in image format) demonstrate that the high albedo markings for swirls are simply not consistent with immature regolith as is now understood from detailed analyses of lunar samples [eg 3]. However, M3 data show that the high albedo features of swirls are distinct and quite different from normal soils (in both the highlands and the mare). They allexhibit a flatter continuum across the near-infrared, but the actual band strength of ferrous minerals shows little (if any) deviation [4]. Recent analyses of magnetic field direction at swirls [5] mimic the observed albedo patterns (horizontal surface fields in bright areas, vertical surface fields in dark lanes). When coupled with the optical properties of magnetic separates of lunar soils [6] and our knowledge that the magnetic component of the soil results from space weathering [3,6], we propose a new and very simple explanation for these enigmatic albedo markings: the lunar swirls result from magnetic sorting of a well developed regolith. With time, normal gardening of the soil over a magnetic anomaly causes some of the dark magnetic component of the soil to be gradually removed from regions (high albedo areas) and accumulated in others (dark lanes). We are modeling predicted sorting rates using realistic rates of dust production. If this mechanism is tenable, only the origin of these magnetic anomalies (their magnitude, size, orientation, and depth) remains to be resolved.\nRefs: 1. Blewett, DT et al. 2011, JGR , 116. 2.

            "abstract": "The Hartford basin is an early Mesozoic, fault-bounded half-graben that formed during the breakup of Pangea. Along with other eastern North American rift basins, it has incurred significant post-rift deformation. Previous authors have identified three phases of deformation in the Hartford basin: WNW-ESE extension (rifting), NNE-SSW shortening (basin-parallel inversion), and E-W shortening (consistent with the current state of stress on the eastern North American margin). More recent work from other rift basins suggests a fourth phase of deformation possibly associated with massive volcanic activity shortly after cessation of rifting. Paleostress directions inferred from CAMP dike orientations and large-scale compressive structures in the southern rift basins reflect a NW-SE shortening phase that is seemingly absent from the Hartford, Newark, and Fundy basins of the central segment. If this compressional phase is consistent along volcanic passive margins, it should be recorded in the synrift deposits of the central basins. Our preliminary dataset shows a significant number of faults that are inconsistent with the previous three-phase model of WNW-ESE rifting, NNE-SSW compression, and E-W compression. A paleostress inversion of these incompatible faults reveals a distinct conjugate pattern of strike-slip faults that are indicative of NW-SE compression. This phase is consistent with the basin inversion seen in the southern rift basins. The presence of a NW-SE compressional stage is also consistent with the hypothesis that depicts massive volcanic upwelling that acts to shorten the upper crust after rifting. If this model is consistent along the eastern North American margin, it is likely applicable to volcanic margins around the world.",

This provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine the role of the gradient drift instability (GDI) on polar cap patches as they convect from day to night. The most rapid GDI growth times are caused by the kilometer-scale gradients, and these gradients appear as initial structuring that persists during the approximate 90 minutes it takes a patch to cross the polar cap. According to linear theory, the calculated GDI growth times range from 23 s to 147 s in this case study.

Human activity plays a major role in this change and is projected to do so well into the future. This is the stance taken in Our Changing Climate, the brand new climate science ebook from the American Meteorological Society (AMS). Our Changing Climate investigates Earth’s climate system, explores humans’ impact on it, and identifies actions needed in response to climate change.\nReleased in August 2014, Our Changing Climate is the result of a year’s worth of intensive research and writing, incorporating the latest scientific understandings of Earth’s climate system from reports such as IPCC AR5 and the Third National Climate Assessment. To encourage additional exploration of climate science information, scientific literature, from which chapter content was derived, is cited at the conclusion of each chapter. In addition, Topic In Depth sections appear throughout each chapter and lead to more extensive information related to various topics. For example, a Topic In Depth in Chapter 11 describes the effect of climate extremes on ranching enterprises in Nebraska.\nClimate science is multi-disciplinary and therefore Our Changing Climate covers a breadth of topics. From understanding basic statistics and geospatial tools used to investigate Earth’s climate system to examining the psychological and financial reasons behind climate change denial, the AMS believes that a multi-disciplinary approach is the most effective way to increase climate literacy.\nOur Changing Climate is part of the AMS Climate Studies course which is intended for undergraduate-level students. Other course materials include an eInvestigations Manual and access to the RealTime Climate Portal, both of which provide weekly activities corresponding to that week’s chapter content. The RealTime Climate Portal also has links to climate data as well as societal interactions and climate policy websites to spur further interest. Faculty support materials are also provided. AMS Climate Studies has been licensed by 130 institutions since Fall 2010.\nOur Changing Climate reveals the impact that each of us has on the climate.

            "abstract": "The sedimentation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the largest carbon (C) sink in the combined biosphere, atmosphere and ocean systems, and therefore influences the global C cycle. Coccolithophores are important contributors to CaCO3 sediment production, with contributions varying from 95% of the total marine CaCO3in the Cenozoic to 50% in the modern ocean. Consequently, physiological adaptations of coccolithophores′ calcification and photosynthesis to varying ambient conditions have implications for the C cycle.\nIt has been recently shown that under low CO2 concentrations (CO2 threshold of ~20 μM), coccolithophores reallocate HCO3- from the calcification vesicle to the chloroplast to cope with the decrease in CO2 available for photosynthesis. This adaptation was first observed in the late Miocene, as δ13C of the more sensitive larger coccoliths (with lower surface to volume ratios) became lighter due to the diminished use of HCO3- and increased use of CO2 as C source for calcification (Bolton and Stoll, 2013). Without further physiological adaptations to maintain calcification, reduced HCO3-availability for calcification may result in less calcified coccoliths (e.g. thinner and lighter).\nHere we report δ44/40Ca and δ13C measurements of cultured Emiliana huxleyi, Calcidiscus leptoporus and Gephyrocapsa oceanica grown under varying CO2 concentrations. We test the hypothesis whether Ca transport is influenced by coccolithophores to maintain calcification at low CO2 concentrations. It is possible that as the reallocation of HCO3- from the calcification vesicle to the chloroplast is increasing in response to low CO2 availability for photosynthesis, Ca transport and concentration would also increase to maintain high saturation at the site of calcification. We also present δ44/40Ca and δ13C from two coccolith size fractions from site 925 in the Western Equatorial Atlantic from the last ~11 Myr, to access how the Ca system of coccolithophores of different sizes may have responded to the decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over this time interval.",

            "abstract": "After 10 years of ESA’s Mars Express orbiting the planet its High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) covered about 90 % of the surface in stereo and color with resolutions up to 10 m/pixel. Digital elevation models of up to 50 m grid spacing [1], generated from all suitable datasets of the stereo coverage, currently cover about 40 % of the surface [2]. The geomorphological analysis of surface features, observed by the HRSC indicate major surface modifications by endogenic and exogenic processes on all scales. Endogenic landforms (e.g., tectonic rifts, small basaltic shield volcanoes) were found to be very similar to their equivalents on Earth, suggesting that no unique processes are required to explain their formation. Volcanism may have been active up to the very recent past or even to the present, putting important constraints on thermal evolution models [e.g. 3]. The analysis of diverse landforms produced by aqueous processes revealed that surface water activity was likely episodic, but ranged in age from very ancient to very recent [e.g. 3]. Particularly important is prominent glaciation and periglacial features at several latitudes, including mountain glaciers [e.g. 3]. The identification of aqueous alteration minerals and their geological context has enabled a better understanding of paleoenvironmental conditions and pedogenetic processes [e.g. 4]. Dark dunes contain volcanic material and are evidence for the significantly dynamic surface environment, characterized by widespread erosion, transport, and redeposition [e.g. 3]. Since basically all geologic interpretations of extraterrestrial features require profound knowledge of the Earth as key reference, studies of terrestrial analogues are mandatory in planetary geology. Field work in Antarctica, Svalbard and Iceland [e.g. 5] provided a basis for the analysis of periglacial and volcanic processes, respectively.\n",

            "abstract": "Existing experimental and numerical models of ash sedimentation from volcanic plumes consider aerodynamic properties of particles as a function of their shape, density and size. However, rather than individually, particles are often observed to settle through zones of high particle concentration associated with gravitational instabilities (e.g., particle-rich fingers) where sedimentation is controlled by the properties of the bulk down-flow of settling particles. In order to investigate the differences in the aerodynamic behaviour of ash particles when settling individually or in mass, we performed systematic large-scale ash settling experiments.\nNatural basaltic ash from Etna (Italy, sampled in July 2014) and trachytic, pumiceous ash from Laacher See (Germany, 12.900 y BP) was used as starting material. For Etna, we used particles in the classes 0-125 and 125-500 µm, for Laacher See, we used 40-90 and 500-1000 µm. For each class, we released 40-500 g of sample from heights of 2 to 5 m with different, controlled volumetric flow rates, in an unconstrained open space and at minimal air movement. All experiments were recorded with a high-speed camera at 2000 fps. A vertical laser sheet crossing the flow enhanced visibility of particles. After release, particles were observed to cluster, leading to locally enhanced fall velocities.\nHigh-speed imaging, manual and automatic tracking analyses are being used to provide full characterization of particle settling dynamics as a function of particle concentration in the flow, density and particle size. SEM analysis will provide particle shape characterization. The main results are i) measured settling velocities of individual particles increase with increasing particle concentration; ii) particle sorting during sedimentation is observed. This suggests that particle dispersion during fallout may be one reason explaining larger than theoretical depletion rates of fine particles from volcanic ash clouds.",

However, the formation mechanism and dynamics of the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis is still debated. In order to better understand the deep structures beneath eastern Himalaya, we further deployed 35 broadband seismic stations (2010-2013) around the Namche Barwa Mountain, which is integrated with the existing Lehigh data sets of 45 stations (2003-2004). We totally selected 18,979 high-quality P-wave arrival times from 2,140 teleseismic events to image P-wave teleseismic tomography. The results demonstrate complex deep structures and significantly different subduction modes in the eastern Himalaya. In contrast to the steep subduction of the Indian lithosphere beneath the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, the Indian slab flatly subducted in the west, which might extend close to the Bangong-Nujiang Suture and then steeply sink and bend over. The contrasting subduction model results in the tearing and fragmentation of the Indian lithosphere in the transition zone between the flat and steep subduction. Consequently, the upwelling of hot asthenospheric mantle may occur through the slab tear window, which might further lead to the rapid uplift of Namche Barwa and the formation of the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis. The lateral variation in subduction mode and slab tearing induced asthenospheric mantle upwelling is similar to that observed in the Hellenide and Anatolide domains of the Tethyan orogen.",

The Picture Post is an environmental monitoring project a part of Digital Earth Watch, a citizen science initiative funded by NASA. Picture Post creates opportunities for educators and community members to take digital photos from octagonal platforms on posts registered as part of the Picture Post national network and then share these photos online. Penn State Brandywine joined the Picture Post project May 27, 2014, to begin a long-term monitoring program, starting with an environmental baseline of the campus landscape. Four post locations were selected on campus based upon projected major construction projects. Photos at each post are being taken by students on a weekly basis and uploaded to the Picture Post website. The campus community and beyond are also being encouraged to take their own photos to upload to the website. Instructional signage has been placed on each post, and a Penn State Brandywine Picture Post website (\nhttp://sites.psu.edu/picturepost/\n) has been created to explain the project and campus objectives in more detail. This project was started by a student as part of her undergraduate summer research experience and will continue to be managed by students in future semesters. With just a half-year of Picture Post photos, it is evident that there are documented changes in the environment because of construction and expected seasonal variations. The Picture Post photos have provided enough data for an initial undergraduate research project with a student analyzing and comparing the variations in the greenness factor of the photos with supplemental temperature and precipitation data. This project will continue to provide opportunities for citizen contributions to the network as well as data for student investigations of the changing campus environment.",

            "abstract": "Large wildfire events are increasingly recognized for their adverse effects on air quality and visibility, thus providing motivation for improving smoke emission estimates. The Rim Fire, one of the largest events in California’s history, produced a large smoke plume that was sampled by the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) DC-8 aircraft with a full suite of in-situ and remote sensing measurements on 26-27 August 2013. We developed an inversion methodology which uses the WRF-Chem modeling system to constrain hourly fire emissions, using as initial estimates the NASA Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED). This method differs from the commonly performed top-down estimates that constrain daily (or longer time scale) emissions. The inversion method is able to simultaneously improve the model fit to various SEAC4RS airborne measurements (e.g., organic aerosol, carbon monoxide (CO), aerosol extinction), ground based measurements (e.g., AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD), CO), and satellite data (MODIS AOD) by modifying fire emissions and utilizing the information content of all these measurements. Preliminary results show that constrained emissions for a 6 day period following the largest fire growth are a factor 2-4 higher than the initial top-down estimates. Moreover, there is a tendency to increase nocturnal emissions by factors sometimes larger than 20, indicating that vigorous fire activity continued during the night. This deviation from a typical diurnal cycle is confirmed using geostationary satellite data. The constrained emissions also have a larger day-to-day variability than the initial emissions and correlate better to daily area burned estimates as observed by airborne infrared measurements (NIROPS). Experiments with the assimilation system show that performing the inversion using only satellite AOD data produces much smaller correction factors than when using all available data, suggesting that top-down emissions estimates for exceptional fire events could be underestimated by current inversion methods. The changes in fire emissions can significantly affect the fire impacts on surface air quality, aerosol loads and its effects on meteorology, highlighting the need of performing these studies.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, vast amounts of carbon isotopic data have been collected allowing the construction of the Phanerozoic δ13C curve in unprecedented detail. Our dataset comprises 8143 points spanning the last 541 m.y., with a mean spacing of 66 k.y. The average δ13C of Phanerozoic carbonate is 1 ‰ ± 2 ‰, in accordance with the canonical values measured in the past. However, the record also shows numerous, highly resolved, large (± 6 ‰) excursions whose magnitude declines through time, especially going into the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. When the magnitude – distribution of the excursions is tabulated we find that it follows a power law: plotting the min-max differences vs. number of bins in which a particular value occurs reveals that the data fall on a semilogarithmic line with a slope of -0.23 and R2 = 0.99. The result is insensitive to outliers: smoothing the data with lowess, spline, Savitzky-Golay, and Butterworth filters yields similar results. The continuity from small variation to large perturbations, both positive and negative, suggests that, despite the numerous proposed causes for individual carbon isotopic evens, there is likely an underlying mechanism which governs the magnitude of δ13C response to perturbations. We suggest that a mechanism acting to amplify carbon cycle perturbations is the key to explaining the power-law distribution, and identify the anoxia-productivity feedback as the most likely candidate. Establishment of sulfidic conditions is accompanied by increased release of phosphate to the water column, which allows for further productivity, and thus acts as a destabilizing, positive, feedback. This feedback would act to increase carbon cycle swings irrespective of their proximal trigger. The decline in frequency of anoxic-sulfidic bottom waters in the world’s oceans, and potential disappearance in the Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic, may account for a reduction in the Earth system's gain and increase in its resilience.",

Just as spalled neutrons and gamma rays reveal elemental abundances in the lunar regolith, albedo protons may be a complimentary method for mapping compositional variations.\nWe presently find that the lunar maria have an average proton yield 0.9% ±0.3% higher than the average yield in the highlands; this is consistent with neutron data that is sensitive to the regolith’s average atomic weight.\nWe also see cases where two or more adjacent pixels (15° × 15°) have significantly anomalous yields above or below the mean. These include two high-yielding regions in the maria, and three low-yielding regions in the far-side highlands. Some of the regions could be artifacts of Poisson noise, but for completeness we consider possible effects from compositional anomalies in the lunar regolith, including pyroclastic flows, antipodes of fresh craters, and so-called \"red spots\".

            "abstract": "Real-time drought monitoring enables a proactive drought management approach that can lead to timely actions to mitigate the losses due to a drought event. In recent years, the availability of long-term, high quality, satellite and reanalysis based datasets of atmospheric forcings, combined with the development of state-of-the-art hydrologic models have made real-time global drought monitoring feasible. Hydrologic models are invaluable tools for global drought monitoring given the scarcity of long-term moisture observations (e.g. soil moisture, streamflow). However, as valuable as they are for drought monitoring, characteristics of a drought event (i.e. onset, severity and persistence) as estimated by a hydrologic model depend on the model’s parameters (e.g. soil and vegetation parameters) and its inherent dynamics that guide the partition of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff. One approach to account for the differences in drought estimates due to differences in model dynamics is to use multiple hydrologic models. Each hydrologic model is forced with the same atmospheric forcings to simulate moisture conditions which are converted into objective drought indicators (e.g. soil moisture percentile) with respect to the model’s own climatology and then those estimates are combined to provide a multimodel based drought estimates. The University of Washington’s Global Drought Information System (GDIS) developed in 2013, is one such prototype drought monitoring system. This system uses the VIC, NOAH and Catchment models. In this presentation we investigate how the differences in the dynamics of the models used in UW’s GDIS, influence the drought monitoring estimates. Specifically we answer following questions: 1.What is the level of uncertainties in drought onset, severity and persistence as estimated by different hydrologic models? 2. How do the uncertainties vary spatially and seasonally? 3. What are the sources of the uncertainties?",

            "abstract": "Foundering of mafic lower continental crust (LCC) is often invoked to account for the relatively silicic composition of the bulk crust. However, the fate of this foundered material in the mantle is not well understood. Here we give geochemical evidence, including Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope data, for historic Wudalianchi potassic basalts from NE China, to show that these basalts with extreme EM1 signatures can be direct melts derived from foundered LCC. They are characterized by linear trends between major elements, isotopes and trace elements ratios, suggesting mixing of a high-Si, low-Mg component with a low-Si, high-Mg one. The two end-members are nearly indistinguishable on a trace element spidergram, and both exhibit relative depletion of Th, U, Nb, Ta and Ti, and positive anomalies of Ba, K, Pb. The small range of absolute abundances of trace elements and the absence of Sr and Eu anomalies argue against significant crustal assimilation, which is further confirmed by a negative correlation between Nb/Th ratios and εHf. As a result, we suggest that these chemical features were inherited from foundered mafic lower crustal materials.\nFoundered mafic LCC will transform into garnet pyroxenites in the mantle. Experiments have shown that silica-excess and silica-deficient pyroxenites at high pressures can generate the major element compositions of both end-members of Wudalianchi basalts. Quantitative modeling of garnet pyroxenite melting with LCC as starting compositions can reproduce the trace element pattern of Wudalianchi lavas. Therefore, we suggest Wudalianchi lavas to be direct melts of foundered LCC, without requiring reaction between melt and peridotite. Correlations of decreasing 206Pb/204Pb with increasing SiO2 have been observed in Cenozoic basalts from North and NE China, suggesting that the involvement of foundered mafic LCC has played a more important role than previously thought for the genesis of this intra-plate magmatism.",

            "abstract": "There are multiple competing definitions of magnetic reconnection in 3D (e.g., Hesse and Schindler [1988], Lau and Finn [1990], and Boozer [2002]). In this work we focus on separator reconnection. A magnetic separator can be understood as the 3D analogue of a 2D x line with a guide field, and is defined by the line corresponding to the intersection of the separatrix surfaces associated with the magnetic nulls. A separator in the magnetosphere represents the intersection of four distinct magnetic topologies: solar wind, closed, open connected to the northern hemisphere, and open connected to the southern hemisphere. The integral of the parallel electric field along the separator defines the rate of open flux production, and is one measure of the reconnection rate. We present three methods for locating magnetic separators and apply them to 3D resistive MHD simulations of the Earth’s magnetosphere using the BATS-R-US code. The techniques for finding separators and determining the reconnection rate are insensitive to IMF clock angle and can in principle be applied to any magnetospheric model. The present work examines cases of high and low resistivity, for two clock angles. We also examine the separator during Flux Transfer Events (FTEs) and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.",

            "abstract": "The composition of planets in the modern solar system can be traced to the chemistry and physics of the solar nebula, the diffuse disk of gas and dust that surrounded the young sun immediately after its formation. Materials such as the noble gases were too volatile to be chemically incorporated by planetary embryos. Instead, it is likely that they were trapped physically and transported to the inner planets by migrating comets and planetesimals. One trapping mechanism under consideration is the capture of noble gas atoms in amorphous ices on the surface of cold grains. We created a simple numerical model to explore this mechanism, using argon as a representative volatile gas. We have demonstrated that our model reproduces experimental trapping efficiencies (ratio of the volatile atoms to water molecules in the deposited ice) when we constrain the binding energy of our representative volatile to 3500-5500K and the sticking efficiency of volatile atoms to 0.004x gas phase water pressure. Binding energy and sticking efficiency are poorly understood for most volatile substances, but this study finds that they are among the most critical when predicting the trapping of volatiles in the physical world. Constraining these parameters under nebular conditions will allow us to evaluate how much argon could have been trapped in nebular ices and ultimately assess the role of amorphous ice trapping in the origin of planetary volatiles.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic field measurements made by the MESSENGER spacecraft in orbit around Mercury have shown that, to first order, Mercury’s internal field can be described by an axially aligned dipole, offset by 479 km north of the geographic equator (the offset axial dipole, hereafter OAD). Near-periapsis MESSENGER magnetic field measurements at altitudes less than 200 km have been obtained since April 2014. We use these observations, together with higher altitude data from orbits that have been characterized with low magnetic activity , to identify non-OAD internal field structure and to establish whether it is of crustal and/or core origin. Magnetospheric models developed with MESSENGER data allow estimated contributions from magnetopause, magnetotail, and OAD fields to be subtracted from vector magnetic field measurements, and the sources of residual signatures to be examined. For measurements made at spacecraft altitudes above 200 km, determining the magnitude and sources of additional regional and global-scale contributions to the internal field has been challenging because of MESSENGER’s orbit geometry and because the residuals are dominated by additional external fields that are organized in the local time frame and that vary with magnetospheric activity. After accounting for the large-scale magnetospheric fields, any additional external field contributions to the residual fields are estimated empirically in the local time frame. We investigate crustal and core contributions to the remaining signals, in particular to the low altitude signals, by examining repeatability in the body-fixed frame and using global (spherical harmonic) and local (equivalent source dipole) basis functions with regularization. Crustal sources associated with large-scale regional geological provinces such as the northern lowlands, the northern rise, and major impact basins are investigated and equivalent spherical harmonic core/crustal field spectra computed.",

            "abstract": "Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, which is one of the major mineral constituents of mafic and ultramafic rocks, has an attractive potential for CO2 mineral sequestration, as it possesses a high content of carbonate-forming divalent cations and exhibits one of the highest dissolution rate amongst rock-forming minerals. This study reports drastic differences in carbonation yields between experiments performed on olivine-rich basalt samples and on olivine separates (a more restricted chemical system). Batch experiments were conducted in water at 150°C and pCO2 = 280 bars on a Mg-rich tholeiitic basalt (9.3 wt.% MgO and 12.2 wt.% CaO), composed of olivine, Ti-magnetite, plagioclase and clinopyroxene. After 45 days of reaction, 56 wt.% of the initial MgO has reacted with CO2 to form Fe-bearing magnesite (Mg0.8Fe0.2)CO3 along with minor calcium carbonates. The substantial decrease of olivine content upon carbonation supports the idea that ferroan magnesite formation mainly follows from olivine dissolution. In contrast, in experiments performed under similar run durations and P/T conditions with a San Carlos olivine separate (47.8 wt.% MgO) of similar grain size, only 5 wt.% of the initial MgO content reacted to form Fe-bearing magnesite. The overall carbonation kinetics of the basalt is enhanced by a factor of 40. It could be accounted for by differences in chemical and textural properties of the secondary-silica layer which covers reacted olivine grains in both types of sample. A TEM inspection of mineral surfaces shows that the thin amorphous silica layer (~100 nm) is porous in the case of the basalt sample and that it contains significant amounts of iron and aluminum. Thus, we propose that the composition of the olivine environment itself can strongly influence the olivine dissolution-carbonation process. Consequently, laboratory data obtained on olivine separates might yield a conservative estimate of the true carbonation potential of olivine-bearing basaltic rocks. More generally, this study questions the approach which consists in evaluating the carbonation potential of a rock based on experiments on separate minerals. It also emphasizes the impact of fO2 and potential co-injected gases on the olivine dissolution-carbonation process.",

            "abstract": "Natural or anthropogenic episodic events such as snowmelt, floods, fire, insect-defoliation, pollutant spills, etc. can result in sudden and unexpected changes in runoff water quality from watersheds. Depending on the magnitude and intensity of the change, such events which are also occasionally referred to as “hot moments”, can have significant ecological and environmental consequences. Measuring and recording such rapid and unexpected changes in runoff quality has always been a logistical challenge. However, the advent of in-situ, UV- and fluorescence-based spectrometers that can continuously measure water quality changes at high-frequency (minutes to hours) show considerable promise. We implemented a UV-vis spectrometer (Spectrolyser, S::CAN Inc.) to characterize the stream water quality at every 30 minutes from a small (12 ha) forested watershed located in the Piedmont region of Maryland. The spectrometer recorded the UV-Vis spectrum (200-750 nm), turbidity (NTU), nitrate-N (mgN/L), and total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC, respectively; mgC/L). To evaluate the accuracy of the sensor values, water sampling was also performed simultaneously using automated ISCO samplers for multiple storms since November 2013. Water samples have been analyzed for suspended solids, particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (OC), and nitrate-N. In addition, water samples were also analyzed on laboratory spectrometers to develop a variety of UV and fluorescence metrics that characterize the lability and recalcitrance of DOC. Key questions that we address here are: How reliable and accurate are the spectrometer values for dissolved and particulate species of OC and nitrate-N? How does the magnitude of the storms and the amount of suspended sediment influence the accuracy of sensor readings? Can the sensor UV-vis data provide insights into DOC character/composition similar to those derived from lab-based UV and fluorescence metrics? Addressing these questions is critical to the long-term use of these sensors and their ability to provide critical insights into watershed and ecological processes.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has revealed unexpected dynamical variability in the extratropical atmosphere. Work by Thompson & Woodworth (2013) and Thompson & Barnes (2014) has demonstrated the existence of a baroclinic annular mode (BAM), a 20-30 day oscillation of the zonally averaged eddy-kinetic energy (EKE). This study explores EKE oscillations in the Southern Hemisphere in the context of two distinct questions: (1) At what zonal scale does the BAM signal appear? (2) Do different regions of the Southern Hemisphere contribute more to the BAM than others?\nIn order to answer these two questions, the study uses data from two different models: the GFDL gray-radiation aquaplanet model and the GFDL-CM3 GCM. Analysis of the aquaplanet power spectra isolates the question of scale while the GFDL-CM3 analysis is used to investigate both the question of scale and geographic distribution. Results indicate EKE oscillations with peaks within the frequencies of analysis (20-30 days) to ranges as small as 35 degrees zonal width in the aquaplanet, and 120 degrees zonal width in the fully-coupled GCM. The geographic distribution of EKE in the GCM suggests the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean regions contribute more to the BAM signal. Preliminary results suggest possibile variations in frequency/period at different geographic locations that warrant further investigation. Ultimately, the scale and geographic location of EKE oscillations/the BAM may have important implications for precipitation at regional scales.",

We find that a more plausible scenario is that it formed as part of the rifting of Amazonia from Laurentia and became inactive once seafloor spreading was established. The MCR has aspects both of a continental rift - a segmented linear depression filled with sedimentary and igneous rocks - and a large igneous province (LIP). Comparison of areas and volumes for a range of continental LIPS shows that the MCR volcanic rocks are significantly thicker than the others. The MCR flood basalts have steeper dips and thicker overlying sediments than other continental flood basalts, and were deposited in a subsiding basin after most extension ended, indicating that they are better viewed as post-rift than syn-rift rocks. Hence we view the MCR as a LIP deposited in crust weakened by rifting, and thus first a rift and then a LIP.",

Working in partnership with regional institutions around the world, SERVIR develops geospatial tools and decision-support applications while concurrently building the capacity of local analysts and decision-makers to utilize them. In many cases, these same users are helping shape the tools that provide them with critical information.

They were built to host ‘low-background’ Astroparticle Physics experiments, needing to be shielded from interference produced by cosmic radiation. These unique infrastructures show great diversity in terms of depth, size, and geological and environmental characteristics.\nOver the last decade, the four European deep underground laboratories – LSM in France, LSC in Spain, LNGS in Italy and Boulby in the UK – supported by their funding agencies, have been making great efforts to get integrated into a single distributed research infrastructure. At the same time, they have been asking “how can our facilities, primarily built for Astroparticle Physics, be used to tackle global challenges?”. Astroparticle Physicists have wide experience in forming long-term large international collaborations, developing innovative technologies, building unique facilities and organising data handling, reduction, storage and analysis: all of these were put to the disposal of scientists from other disciplines. As a result, a number of very interesting multidisciplinary projects have been hosted in the labs with excellent scientific results: geologists, climatologists, environmental scientists and biologists from academia and public authorities have all used these deep underground environments. Even more recently, the four European labs have decided to go one step further: in order to treat global challenges, global cooperation is necessary, so they are trying to unite the global deep underground science community around these multidisciplinary synergies.\nThe objective of this talk is to present the bottom-up policy adopted by these world-leading European research infrastructures related to global environmental change, including some of the most interesting scientific results received so far (e.g. muon tide detector for continuous, passive monitoring of offshore CO2 deep storage sites, radionuclide dating of lake sediments to understand climate change, detectors of large flood events to alert civil protection authorities, etc).

            "abstract": "Abrupt droughts in West Africa impart significant socio-economic impacts on the developing countries of this region, and yet a comprehensive understanding of the causes and duration of such droughts remains elusive. Much of the summertime rainfall associated with the West African Monsoon (WAM) falls within the Niger River basin and eventually drains into the eastern Gulf of Guinea, contributing to the low sea-surface salinity of this region. Of the limited number of studies that reconstruct Gulf of Guinea salinity through the deglacial, the most comprehensive of those is located ~ 400 km east of the Niger delta and may not be solely influenced by WAM runoff. Here, we present XRF and foraminiferal trace metal data from two new cores located less than 100 km from the Western Niger Delta. Radiocarbon dating of cores Grand 21 (4.72oN, 4.48oE) and Fan 17 (4.81oN, 4.41oE) produced near linear sedimentation rates of 20 cm/kyr and 15 cm/kyr respectively. Elemental sediment compositions from XRF core scanning reveal an abrupt 50% increase in SiO2 between 17-15 ka during Heinrich Event 1. This increase, coeval with increases of CaCO3 (+12%) content and Ba/Ti ratios suggests a large increase in primary productivity during H1. Values then decrease at the onset of the Bolling-Allerod (~14.6 kyr) until a similar, albeit smaller increase is recorded during the Younger Dryas beginning at 12.7 kyr. In contrast, FeO2 and TiO2 are thought to be a proxies of Niger River discharge strength and suggest a more gradual change in riverine discharge across the deglacial that is most likely driven by precession. These proxies suggest Niger River runoff was low from the LGM through Heinrich 1, gradually increasing around 13 ka. FeO2 and TiO2 values then peak between 11.5-7.5 kyr, consistent with the African Humid Period, before gradually decreasing through the mid-late Holocene. This deglacial pattern of riverine input is markedly different from previous reconstructions of WAM variability and does not appear to explain the large increases in primary production during H1 or the YD. To further investigate Niger River runoff and water column hydrography change in the Niger Delta across the deglacial, we will also present data from three planktonic foraminifera: Globigerinoides ruber, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Globorotalia crassaformis.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory, field-, and satellite-based visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy allows for rapid, remote, and non-destructive analysis of geologic materials to identify mineralogy as well as organic compounds. This type of analysis has potential to aid the search for organics on Mars as a means of first detection of reduced carbon, or to study organic matter nondestructively in valuable samples such as meteorites. In order to assess potential applications of this method we aim to answer fundamental questions about detection limits and quantification of organic matter using reflectance spectroscopy. Laboratory mixtures and natural samples are measured for total organic carbon (TOC in wt.%) with standard methods and reflectance spectroscopy. Absorption features due to C-H2 and C-H3 bonds are observed in the 3.3 to 3.5μm (3000 to 2850 cm-1) wavelength region. A strong H2O feature near 3μm, as well as carbonate-related absorptions near 3.4µm, are also found in this spectral region and can complicate detection of organic material, particularly at low TOC values. In natural samples without carbonate there appears to be a linear trend between TOC and the band depth of organic absorptions; samples that have low albedo, or strong 3μm water features deviate from this trend line. Spectra of samples with carbonate may be modeled with Gaussians to remove the influence of the carbonate features and better match the organic absorption trend. Early results indicate that quantification of organic matter in natural fine-grained samples using reflectance spectroscopy will need to take low-albedo components and water content into account. Detection limits may also depend on these properties; organic absorption features are clearly seen in the lowest TOC sample measured so far (0.08wt% or 800ppm), which is a relatively bright, carbonate-free, quartz- and clay-dominated outcrop sample. A series of laboratory experiments have been undertaken in which known amounts of organic compounds are mixed with smectitic clay in order to understand detection limits and the effects of albedo and hydration in a controlled setting.

            "abstract": "Observations of Mercury's local plasma environment by MESSENGER have revealed that the planet hosts a strongly asymmetric magnetosphere as a result of an off-axis dipolar or quadrupolar internal field, and significant finite Larmor radius effects at the boundary layer between magnetospheric and solar wind plasma environments. One important asymmetry appears in the growth and evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves at the dawn and dusk flanks of the magnetopause. Linear analysis and global hybrid simulations support a dusk-dawn asymmetry in the growth rate caused by finite Larmor radius effects, and indeed K-H waves have been exclusively observed at the dusk magnetopause during northward IMF. Observations of these K-H waves at sodium gyro-scales invites investigation into the impact of the hot planetary sodium ion population, itself distributed preferentially on the dusk flank, on the growth of the K-H instability and associated plasma transport. We present local two- and three-dimensional hybrid simulations of the dusk and dawn boundary layers, with varying magnetospheric sodium ion number density, and examine the associated changes in the growth rates of the K-H instability, K-H wave spectra, and cross-boundary particle transport. We show that gyroresonance between growing K-H vortices and sodium ion gyration introduces a strong spectral peak at sodium gyro-scales at the dusk magnetopause, that an increase in sodium ion number density increases dawn-dusk asymmetry of K-H growth rates, and that cross-boundary particle transport increases with sodium number density.",

            "abstract": "This work describes numerical models of advection/diffusion between enclaves and host magmas, applied with the aim of estimating time-scales during which enclaves can be homogenised. In particular, advection was simulated using a numerical system consisting of regular and chaotic regions. Results indicate that the homogenisation time of enclaves in chaotic regions is several orders of magnitude faster than in regular regions. For instance, an enclave with a diameter of 100 cm may be homogenised in the chaotic region in about 380 years, assuming an advection velocity of 10 cm/year, whereas in the regular region it would require 6.5×10^5 years for complete homogenisation. This implies that, in the same magmatic system, large differences in the degree of homogenisation may coexist, generating magmatic masses with large spatial and temporal inhomogeneities.\nThe results of this study may have significant petrological and volcanological implications. From a petrological point of view, mafic enclaves dispersed in felsic host rocks are regarded as portions of mafic magma which, trapped inside regular regions, survived the hybridisation process. Instead, host rocks are regarded as regions where efficient mixing dynamics generated hybrid magmas. The fact that a single magmatic mass may display large compositional differences at the same time undermines the assumption of most geochemical models, which assume the temporal and spatial homogeneity of the magma body. From the volcanological perspective, the presence of magmatic enclaves in volcanic rocks allows us to estimate the mixing times of magmas by analysing chemical diffusion patterns between host rocks and enclaves.",

This carbon is vulnerable to release to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4 as high-latitude temperatures warm. Microtopographic features, such as polygonal ground, are characteristic sources of landscape heterogeneity in the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain. In a future warmer climate, the spatial distribution of soil moisture and active layer depth are expected to be key factors controlling the fate of thawed permafrost carbon. Polygonal ground structures, with high or low centers, dominate the local hydrologic environment, thereby impacting the energy balance, biogeochemical dynamics, vegetation communities, and carbon releases from the subsurface. In spite of their importance to local hydrologic and thermal processes, the impact of these microtopographic features at larger spatial scales is not well understood. Our previous work from isothermal surface-subsurface simulations has indicated that statistical moments of soil moisture follow a non-linear scaling relationship. In this study, we perform surface-subsurface non-isothermal flow simulations using PFLOTRAN for four study sites located near Barrow, AK. Simulations are performed on domains at multiple horizontal resolutions for several years.

            "abstract": "Foreland arches’ particular placement far inland relative to active subduction boundaries prompts this long-standing question: do these arches form as a result of lithospheric rheology inherent in the zone between more ancient mobile belts and cratons, or do they result from stress⁄strength conditions driven by more recent processes, such as low-angle subduction? The Sierras Pampeanas basement-cored uplifts in Argentina correspond spatially with present-day low angle subduction, which many consider an analogue for western U.S. Laramide basement arches uplifted contemporaneously with low-angle subduction ˜50 Ma. However, significant questions remain about the lithospheric rheology of the two regions, in particular, how much have they been modified by subduction processes? Seismic anisotropy can potentially indicate how continental lithospheres above subduction zones deform or resist deformation in response to stress, and therefore may constrain possibilities for lithospheric rheology. We contrast two comparable shear wave splitting datasets, for the Sierras Pampeanas and Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, to examine the similarity of continental lithospheric structure in these two regions. Heterogeneous shear wave splitting patterns for Wyoming suggest the existence of Archean lithosphere preserved under the region, supported by seismic fast directions consistent with expected patterns resulting from Wyoming craton assembly orogenic events. Regional tomography shows a thick zone of fast velocity upper mantle, also consistent with ancient lithospheric mantle. In contrast, seismic anisotropy for the Sierras Pampeanas is more homogeneous over a similarly-sized region, with fast directions inconsistent with our expectations for patterns resulting from the assembly of the Andean foreland, and quite consistent with modern deformation expected to result from subduction processes. Seismic wavespeeds indicate that much of the Sierras Pampeanas is not underlain by pristine ancient continental lithosphere, having been modified significantly by the subduction process. These comparisons indicate that different histories accompany the lithospheres of deformed foreland regions, and if these lithospheres have a similar rheology, there are multiple ways to produce such a rheology.",

With funding from the NSF, geoscience and education faculty from different institutions around the state collaborated with ten Earth science teachers to create five online Earth science instructional blueprints. The work is part of the DIG (Diversity and Innovation for Geosciences) Texas Instructional Blueprint project. A blueprint stitches together nine units for a yearlong Earth science course (scope and sequence). Each unit covers three weeks of teaching and contains lectures, readings, visualizations, lab investigations, learning activities, and other educational materials from credible sources, which are aligned with Texas state science standards for Earth and Space Science and the Earth Science Literacy Principles. Taken together, the collection of activities address the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).\nDuring summer 2014, three minority-serving secondary teachers completed a six-week internship at The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG). As DIG Texas Education Interns, we organized and revised the content of the units, created scaffolding notes, and built blueprints by selecting groups of nine units from the project’s current collection of twenty-one units. Because fieldwork is an important element of geoscience learning, we integrated virtual field trips into each unit. We (1) gained expertise in selecting high quality activities that directly correlate with state standards and address the Earth Science Literacy Principles; (2) developed a keen awareness of the value of the NGSS; (3) learned how to navigate through the NGSS website to track the relationships between the Science and Engineering Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, and Crosscutting Concepts for Earth science, as well as connections to other disciplines in the same grade level. Collaborating with other secondary Earth science teachers introduced each of us to new teaching practices, allowing us to build relationships that we expect to last for many years. UTIG researchers mentored and introduced us to their research and methodology. In addition, they helped us find high quality activities for the units. In turn, we shared our knowledge of pedagogy and classroom expertise with them.",

Since the USGS was established in 1879, hundreds of thousands of samples have been gathered in collections that range from localized, geographically-based assemblages to ones that are national or international in scope. These materials include, but are not limited to, rock and mineral specimens; fossils; drill cores and cuttings; geochemical standards; and soil, sediment, and geochemical samples.\nThe USGS National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (NGGDPP) was established with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Since its implementation, the USGS NGGDPP has taken an active role in providing opportunities to inventory, archive and preserve geologic and geophysical samples, and to make these samples and ancillary data discoverable on the Internet. Preserving endangered geoscience collections is more cost effective than recollecting this information. Preserving these collections, however, is only one part of the process – there also needs to be a means to facilitate open discovery and access to the physical objects and the ancillary digital records.\nThe NGGDPP has celebrated successes such as the development of the USGS Geologic Collections Management System (GCMS), a master catalog and collections management plan, and the implementation and advancement of the National Digital Catalog, a digital inventory and catalog of geological and geophysical data and collections held by the USGS and State geological surveys. Over this period of time there has been many lessons learned. With the successes and lessons learned, NGGDPP is poised to take on challenges the future may bring.",

The inherent generated pollution contributes to half of all Earth’s anthropogenic trace metals emissions that, when deposited to glaciers of the surrounding mountains of the Third Pole region, leave a characteristic chemical fingerprint. Records of past atmospheric deposition preserved in snow and ice from Third Pole glaciers provide unique insights into changes of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and into the nature and intensity of the regional atmospheric circulation systems. The determination of the elemental composition of aeolian dust stored in Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau glaciers can help to qualify the potential contamination of glacial meltwater as a part of the greater fresh Asian water source. The 215 m long Puruogangri ice core retrieved in 2000 at 6500 m a.s.l. in central Tibetan Plateau (Western Tanggula Shan, China) provides one of the first multi-millennium-long environmental archives (spanning the last 7000 years and annually resolved for the last 400 years) obtained from the Tibetan Plateau region. The Puruogangri’s area is climatologically of particular interest because of its location at the boundary between the monsoon (wet) and the westerly (dry) dominated atmospheric circulation. The major objective of this study is to determine the concentration of trace and ultra-trace elements in the Puruogangri ice core between 1600 and 2000 AD in order to characterize the atmospheric aerosols entrapped in the ice. Particular attention is given to assess the amount of trace elements originating from anthropogenic sources during both the pre-industrial and industrial periods. The distinction between the anthropogenic contribution and the crustal background may rely on the precise decoupling of the dry and wet seasons signals, the former being largely influenced by dust contribution.",

A systematic simulation study of antiparallel reconnection is performed with the kinetic PIC code P3D. Electrons are energized and heated through reflection across contracting magnetic field lines in the center of the outflow exhaust. Parallel electric fields form to keep electrons trapped in the exhaust and to maintain quasi-neutrality. These parallel fields act as an electron pre-acceleration mechanism which makes the contracting field line energization more efficient. Although the energy gain for each electron pass through the exhaust is weaker for smaller electron mass, the increase in bounce frequency leads to a heating prediction that is independent of the electron to ion mass ratio. Ultimately, this parallel heating isotropizes due to several different scattering mechanisms leading to nearly isotropic heating several 10s of ion inertial lengths downstream of the x-line.",

In both short and long-term timescales, climate change presents material and financial risks to companies in diverse economic sectors. How the private sector accounts for long-term risks while making short-term decisions about operations is a complex challenge. Companies are accountable to shareholders and must report performance to them on a quarterly basis. At the same time, company investors are exposed to long-term climate-related risks and face losses if companies fail to prepare for climate impacts.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) obligates publicly traded companies to discuss risks that might materially affect their business and since 2010, the agency recommends that companies consider and discuss any significant risks to their business from climate change. Some companies have complied with this guidance and comprehensively analyze potential climate change impacts, yet others fail to consider climate change at all. Such omissions leave companies without plans for addressing future risks and expose investors and the public to potential catastrophic events from climate change impacts.\nClimate risk projections can inform companies about the vulnerability of their facilities, supply chains, transportation pathways, and other assets. Such projections can help put climate-related risks in terms of material costs for companies and their investors. Focusing on the vulnerability of coastal facilities, we will use climate change impact projections to demonstrate the economic impacts of climate change faced by the private sector. These risks are then compared to company disclosures to the SEC to assess the degree to which companies have considered their vulnerability to climate change. Finally, we will discuss ways that companies can better assess and manage long-term climate risks.",

There is still significant uncertainty as to the ultimate destination of the released magnetic energy, whether into bulk flows, thermal heating, or energetic particle production. Using a systematic set of 2D kinetic PIC simulations, we study how inflowing plasma conditions and the electron to ion mass ratio modifies the amount of ion heating during magnetic reconnection. Consistent with recent satellite observations, we find that the primary controlling factor is the inflowing Alfven speed, or the magnetic energy per electron-ion pair. In contrast with electron heating findings, introducing a guide field substantially reduces the amount of ion heating. Possible ion heating mechanisms, and well as relative electron to ion heating energy partition, will be discussed.",

Integrating advanced regional-scale crop-growth modeling capabilities into a land surface model (LSM) is not only crucial for assessing potential impacts of climate change and climate variability on crop yields, but also can help to improve the representation of crop-atmosphere interactions in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Therefore, the objectives of developing Noah-MP-CROP are: 1) provide high-spatial and high-temporal resolution regional agro-climatic related products; 2) enhance the simulations of cropland surface-fluxes in the WRF model for numerical weather prediction and regional climate modeling. Noah-MP is a new-generation of LSM that uses multiple parameterizations for land hydrology and energy processes. In this study, we couple species-specific crop phenology and carbon allocation schemes with Noah-MP-based complex simulations of canopy photosynthesis and soil moisture. The Noah-MP-CROP can be executed at field-scales or grid-scales of different spatial resolution and it also can be applied at multiple temporal scales. The major agriculture-related outputs include: grain mass, leaf mass, leaf area index, crop yield, growth primary production, growing degree days, soil temperature, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. The model also allows us to conduct different assessments by using either historical, real-time, short-term forecast or future projected weather input data. In this study, we focus on evaluating the Noah-MP-CROP for the regional agro-climatic assessments in the U.S. Corn Belt. Model simulations are conducted at both field-scale (Bondville, IL and Mead, NE) and grid-scale (4km-resolution). At both field sites, model outputs of crop yield (grain mass), leaf area index and surface fluxes show strong agreement with observations. Also incorporating crop-growth models in Noah-MP improves the simulated latent heat and sensible heat fluxes during the crop growing season.",

            "abstract": "Holocene climate changes in Arctic and subarctic areas were investigated using\ntime series resulting from the analyses of different biological indicators in marine\n(dinocysts, foraminifers, alkenones) and lake (pollen, chironomids, diatoms)\nsediment cores (see compilation by Sundqvist et al. Climate of the Past, 2014).\nThese indicators were used to reconstruct climate-related parameters such as\ntemperatures, precipitation, salinity and/or sea-ice cover. Dinocyst, foraminifer\nand pollen series were usually calibrated with the Modern Analogue Technique\n(MAT) whereas those from chironomids and diatoms mainly used the Weighted Average Partial\nLeast Square (WAPLS) calibration approach. Hence, the available times series used to document long\nterm climate changes are heterogeneous since they are based on different indicators\nand different reconstruction methods.\nIn order to document the climate variability captured by the time series, we have\nanalyzed the scaling behavior of Holocene records (last 12,000 years) by the mean\nof the Haar fluctuations (for a given time interval, these are simply the differences\nbetween the means of the first and second halves of the interval). Over various\nranges of time scale, they can be characterized by exponents H (e.g. [Lovejoy and\nSchertzer, 2012]). When H<0, fluctuations tend to cancel, the series appears\n“stable”, averaging fluctuations over longer and longer intervals typically yields\nsmaller values. When H>0 on the contrary, fluctuations tend to grow with larger time\nintervals as the series “wanders” like a drunkard’s walk, i.e. it appears “unstable”. We\nshow how to perform the analyses in a robust fashion, avoiding biases due to\nirregular sampling and/or variable temporal resolutions. On this basis, we\nwere able to evaluate whether the signals of different paleo-indicators for the\nsame location converge at low frequency, or whether they diverge. Even when\nconsidering the same core, different indicators sometimes yield diverging signals. This\nsuggests variations which could be due to methods of reconstruction or to the\nclimatic signal recorded by the indicators. Despite divergences in some of the regional\nrecords, results consistently show that signals from marine cores tend to be\nmore stable than those from continental environments. ",

The Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP) recently recovered ~300 m of sediment core spanning the Paleocene-Eocene boundary from the Polecat Bench locality in the Bighorn Basin, WY. Core scan images show that oxidative weathering extends some 20-30 m below the surface, suggesting that recent surficial weathering could have significantly altered the magnetic signals preserved in paleosols that crop out in this region. This study presents the first detailed core to outcrop comparison of paleosol magnetism of which we are aware. Nine paleosols from Polecat Bench, spanning the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), have been sampled at high-resolution from outcrop trenches and core sediments. Importantly, these paleosols are stratigraphically below the weathering front in the core sediments, suggesting that they preserve an unweathered magnetic signature. We present results of preliminary comparison between the magnetic signals preserved in core sediments and the same sediments exposed as outcrops using detailed measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility, frequency dependence of susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). We explore the implications of surficial weathering for environmental magnetism, including the application of magnetic paleoprecipitation proxies calibrated using modern soils to more ancient paleosols.",

            "abstract": "In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected from the plasmasheet via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These precipitating electrons can be additionally reflected back into the magnetosphere by the conjugate atmospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections that can greatly influence precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km) and the resultant secondary electron population. We present the solution of the Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E < 600 eV). This solution takes into account, for the first time, the role of multiple atmospheric reflections of the precipitated electrons that initially were moved into the loss cone via wave-particle interaction processes in the Earth’s plasmasheet.",

            "abstract": "Expansion of nitrogen (N2)-fixing trees is a major driver of ecosystem N enrichment in semi-arid grasslands. During this process, fluxes of N trace gases from soils are likely mediated by interactions between changing soil N availability and primary abiotic biogeochemical drivers in arid systems, namely temperature and wetting/re-wetting dynamics. We investigated the effects of encroachment, season and rainfall dynamics on total reactive N flux (NO, NOy, NH3, N2O) in a sub-tropical, semi-arid Texan savanna encroached by N-fixing Prosopis glandulosa over two years. We compared unencroached upland grasslands and non-fixing woody clusters with continuous Prosopis cover over uplands, intermediate drainages, and playa lowlands. We also quantified denitrification potential of intact soil cores to determine whether N2 could contribute significantly to soil N flux.\nSubstantial soil N enrichment in upland Prosopis groves did not elevate N fluxes above those in remnant grasslands, though lower (moister) landscape positions did exhibit higher total emissions. Along with temperature, soil-wetting dynamics explained the greatest portion of variation in emissions and interacted with vegetation type. Timing and quantity of most recent soil wetting and interval to previous wetting were significant predictors, highlighting the importance of dynamics not captured by soil moisture measurements alone. As with other arid systems, rainfall events after dry periods can stimulate pulse emissions of >400 ug NO-N m-2 h-1. At realistic soil O2 concentrations, N2 fluxes fell below the detection limit of the Nitrogen-Free Atmospheric Recirculation Method system (~11 ug N m-2 h-1). However, applying plausible N2O:N2 flux ratios likely constrains the flux to much lower levels under field conditions. We conclude that encroachment does not increase N fluxes from upland savannas, but that interactions with rainfall and landscape position are important determinants of total emissions.",

Those prior measurements revealed the presence of distinct geochemical terranes on Mercury’s surface at the ~1000-km spatial scale. The low-altitude data, in particular measurements acquired below 60 km, provide a spatial resolution of <100 km, facilitating an investigation of the chemical properties of smaller areas of interest. Specific targets include individual polar deposits, fresh impact craters, low-reflectance material, pyroclastic deposits, isolated small expanses of smooth and intercrater plains, and areas with unusual color properties or composition indicated by imaging or other elemental remote sensing observations. Because neutron measurements are particularly sensitive to volatile elements, such as H, Na, and Cl, the low-altitude data provide new insights into volatile transport processes on Mercury, including the sequestration of water ice and other frozen volatile compounds in permanently shadowed craters and volatile-driven volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Snow is considered essential to ecosystems, people, and climate, regulating water availability by mediating runoff and soil moisture throughout the year, and altering planetary radiative balance. Like canary in a coalmine, snow also serves as a kind of sentinel system, providing a benchmark by which we can measure the advance of global warming. Yet recent analyses reveal that the relationship between snow and warming is more complex: Despite warming, for example, the magnitude of internal climate variability suggests some Northern Hemisphere regions may experience snow increases for at least the next 50 years. While studies demonstrate that snow supply is vital and in critical danger, such assessments are based only on projections of annualized supply-side changes, such as the fraction of total annual runoff coming from snowfall. These measures do not consider a region’s unique seasonal patterns of water supply and, in particular, water demand. We therefore do not know snow’s relative importance to each region’s water supply portfolio, and thus how great a risk global warming presents to regional water availability. Here we present the first quantification of snow’s observed role in fulfilling monthly water demand for people in the Northern Hemisphere given each basin’s unique sub-annual patterns of snow accumulation and melt. This quantification also reconciles the requirements of ecosystems and includes the buffering capacity of existing artificial storage, such as dams and reservoirs. Our results provide a meaningful baseline against which projected snow changes (from global warming) or demand changes (from population or land-use change) can be evaluated to identify regions at acute risk of disequilibria between future snow water supply and its demand.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon Forest includes a diverse combination of vegetation characteristics, climate, and land usage that influence emission of the reactive trace-gases driving atmospheric chemistry and particle formation. A better understanding of atmospheric chemistry across this region requires consideration of variation in precursor emissions. To complement the intensive GoAmazon measurement campaigns that are focused on the interaction of Manaus urban plume with surrounding forest emissions we have established a suite of measurements at the km67 site in the Floresta Nacional do Tapajós, south of Santarem. The site is situated midway between the Tapajos River on the west and the BR 163 highway to the east (upwind). The nearby surroundings for up to 6 km on all sides is intact rain forest. A strip along the east side of the highway and adjacent roads has been cleared for agriculture, but the upwind area is otherwise sparsely populated. The km67 site was initially established in 2001 during the LBA campaign as carbon flux site and included CO measurements to identify influence from local and regional biomass burning. A 64 m tower extends above a 40-45 m closed canopy. In 2014 additional instrumentation including continuous NO/NO2, O3, SO2, and CH4 concentration profiles, NOy concentration and fluxes were added. Volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements using a PTR-HRTOF-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction-High Resolution-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer) and particle measurements using a nanoSMPS were added during a campaign in June-July 2014. This period was influenced by heavy precipitation; as a result O3 levels above the canopy were rather low, and declined further close to the ground. Even though there was no evidence of anthropogenic influence NO and NO2 concentrations were significant. Elevated concentrations beneath the canopy indicate soil NO emission is the dominant source. Eddy-covariance flux measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) above the Tapajós forest revealed concentrations and fluxes of more than 100 masses. Most followed a strong diurnal pattern with higher fluxes during the daytime. Some compounds (e.g., isoprene, acetone and monoterpenes) were emitted from the forest canopy while other compounds, primarily oxidation products of the emitted VOC, were deposited to the forest canopy.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates a real-time system that detects earthquakes using only data from Twitter—a service for sending and reading public text-based messages of up to 140 characters. The detector algorithm scans for significant increases in tweets containing the word “earthquake” in several languages and sends internal alerts with the detection time, representative tweet texts, and the location of the population center where most of the tweets originated. It has been running in real-time for over two years and finds, on average, two or three felt events per day, with a false detection rate of 9%.\nThe main benefit of the tweet-based detections is speed, with most detections occurring between 20 and 120 seconds after the earthquake origin time. This is considerably faster than seismic detections in poorly instrumented regions of the world. The detections have reasonable coverage of populated areas globally. The number of Twitter-based detections is small compared to the number of earthquakes detected seismically, and only a rough location and qualitative assessment of shaking can be determined based on Tweet data alone. However, the Twitter-based detections are generally caused by widely felt events in populated urban areas that are of more immediate interest than those with no human impact. We will present a technical overview of the system and investigate the potential for rapid characterization of earthquake damage and effects using the 32 million “earthquake” tweets that the system has so far amassed.\nInitial results show potential for a correlation between characteristic responses and shaking level. For example, tweets containing the word “terremoto” were common following the MMI VII shaking produced by the April 1, 2014 M8.2 Iquique, Chile earthquake whereas a widely-tweeted deep-focus M5.2 north of Santiago, Chile on April 4, 2014 produced MMI VI shaking and almost exclusively “temblor” tweets. We are also investigating the use of other social media such as Instagram to obtain rapid images of earthquake-related damage. An Instagram search following the damaging M6.9 earthquake near the Mexico, Guatemala boarder on July 7, 2014 reveled half a dozen unconfirmed images of damage; the first posted 15 minutes after the event.",

            "abstract": "The size of sediments produced on hillslopes and supplied to channels regulates river incision and thus landscape evolution in steep mountain catchments, yet the controls on sediment size are poorly understood. Analysis using cosmogenic nuclides and detrital thermochronometry on samples collected at the outlet of Inyo Creek, California, has quantified spatial variation in the size of sediment produced on hillslopes, however field data are needed to validate and explain the findings. We report on a field campaign to measure hillslope grain size distributions, and correlate size variations with topographic, geomorphic, and climatic attributes, across an elevation gradient in this steep catchment. We begin by mapping hillslope geomorphic process regimes, which in this watershed, underlain by granodiorite, are: bare bedrock that erodes by spallation and landsliding, angle of repose slopes of talus, landslide and debris flow deposits, and at lower elevations, soil-mantled convex hillslopes. For each process regime, we select sampling sites to span a wide elevation range. We use tape transects to measure the size of particles >100 mm, the extent of bedrock exposure, and density of vegetation. For finer sediments we collect bulk samples for sieve analysis in the lab. On bare bedrock, we measure joint spacing to infer the size of rock fragments produced. For steep, inaccessible areas we analyze photographs, scaled by objects of known size. Early results suggest that sediment production occurs primarily on bare bedrock surfaces that supply regolith-covered surfaces below, which serve as transport pathways and storage reservoirs. At lower elevations in the catchment, size distributions are bimodal, with only large boulders and fine-gravel and sand. At higher elevations, slopes near the channel have a more continuous distribution, including gravel, cobbles, and small boulders. Results to-date are broadly consistent with the geochemical analysis, which found that higher elevation slopes supply coarser sediment. Our ongoing field measurements of hillslope size distributions at Inyo Creek, combined with additional geochemical data, will help test the hypothesis that sediment size varies systematically with elevation, because of altitudinal gradients in climate and dominant erosional process.",

XM2 is framed by six science questions, each motivated by discoveries and observations made during MESSENGER’s Primary and First Extended Missions: (1) What active and recent processes have affected Mercury’s surface? (2) How has the state of stress in Mercury’s crust evolved over time? (3) How have compositions of volcanic materials on Mercury evolved over time? (4) What are the characteristics of volatile emplacement and sequestration in Mercury’s north polar region? (5) What are the consequences of precipitating ions and energetic electrons at Mercury? (6) How do Mercury’s exosphere and magnetosphere respond to both extreme and stable solar wind conditions during solar maximum and the declining phase of the solar cycle? Also since March 2013, the periapsis altitude, or closest approach distance to Mercury’s surface, has declined progressively with each orbit, in response to the gravitational attraction of the Sun, although the rate of that decline depends on the angle between the Mercury–Sun line and MESSENGER’s orbit plane. For the first year of XM2, no propulsive orbit-correction maneuvers (OCMs) were conducted to change the evolution of the spacecraft’s orbital parameters. Because sufficient propellant remained at the end of that year to complete four periapsis-raising OCMs, a low-altitude campaign was designed to use those maneuvers to maximize the number of orbits for which the periapsis altitude is as low as 15–25 km. The periapsis altitude passed below 200 km altitude for the first time on 20 April 2014 and below 100 km altitude for the first time on 25 July 2014. It will reach 25 km for three extended intervals prior to OCMs on 12 September and 24 October 2014 and 21 January 2015. A two-week period in February and March 2015 during which the periapsis altitude will be ~15 km precedes the end of mission on 28 March 2015 and will provide the highest-resolution observations of Mercury ever attained.",

We have investigated the behavior of these species by focusing on two regions, Europe and Asia. In Europe, surface emissions have decreased significantly since the 1980s, which have led to a decrease in the concentrations of several tropospheric compounds. On the contrary, emissions in Asia have dramatically increased, particularly during the past two decades, which has resulted in large increases in the atmospheric content of several species.\nWe have used in-situ observations of O3, CO and NO2 from the Cooperative Air Sampling Network and from network of the European monitoring and evaluation programme (EMEP) to analyze the model results in different stations in the regions under consideration. We have also compared the model results with remote sensing observations from MOPITT, OMI, GOME, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY instruments.

            "abstract": "A wide range of climates exists on planet Earth, and the different kinds of life inhabiting each area vary greatly in accordance with its topography and weather conditions. The nature of each climate is in part determined by its latitude—latitudes closer to 90º suggest a colder climate while latitudes closer to 0º suggest a warmer, more tropical climate. The evolution of organisms is expected to differ in different parts of the world because environment plays such a significant role in it. In our study, we focus on the relationship between location and the extent to which the evolution of ostracod body size follows Cope’s Rule (i.e., the tendency for body size to increase over time) and Bergmann’s Rule (i.e., body size decreases with temperature) from the Ordovician to the Holocene. Using body sizes of ostracod occurrences, we explored the relationships among size, latitude and time. Modern ecosystems near the poles are more sensitive to environmental and climate change than those near the equator, we hypothesized that ostracods with latitudes closer to the poles will follow Cope’s Rule more closely. To test this hypothesis, we compared body size and latitude as well as trends of body size evolution over time in tropical, temperate and polar regions. The graphs produced showed that over different latitudes, there was a decreasing trend in the mean size of ostracods over time. This means that the evolution of ostracod body size does not follow Cope’s Rule any more in polar and temperate regions than it does in tropical regions. In fact, our data suggests that ostracods do not necessarily follow Cope’s Rule or Bergmann’s Rule at all, which concurs with a notion that has been previously brought up—the possibility that ectothermic marine organisms are exceptions to Bergmann’s Rule.",

            "abstract": "The fast magnetosonic mode is one of the dominant wave modes in the Earth's radiation belts. These waves influence the ring current by scattering ions in energy in the 10's of keV range, and are believed to be a heat source for radiation belt electrons. The fast magnetosonic mode observed around the Earth's inner equatorial magnetosphere sometimes exhibits quasi-periodic modulation as detected by the Van Allen probes. During each modulation the wave frequency exhibits a strong drifting (dispersive) signature characterized by a rising tone. Each tone is composed of harmonics with spacing close to the proton cyclotron frequency. The tones are band limited in frequency and mainly observed above the 20th harmonic of the local proton cyclotron frequency. We observe this modulation mainly outside the plasmapause, but it has also been observed to penetrate down to 1.5 RE. The modulation is observed up to magnetic latitudes of ±17º, at all magnetic local times, but its signatures are more pronounced on the dayside. For events where lower frequency ULF waves are detected, the period of the ULF wave is about twice the modulation period of the fast magnetosonic mode, suggesting strong wave-wave interactions. The modulation period varies from 50 to 200 s and its duration ranges from 0.2 to 3 h, with the maximum duration limited by the spacecraft orbit. We hypothesize that the rising tone is produced by changing Alfven velocities created by steepened density fluctuations due to plasma modification by an underlying ULF wave.",

            "abstract": "Drought prediction from monthly to seasonal time scales is of critical importance to disaster mitigation, agricultural planning, and multi-purpose reservoir management. Starting in December 2012, NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) has been providing operational Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) Outlooks using the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) forecasts, to support CPC's monthly drought outlooks and briefing activities. The current NMME system consists of six model forecasts from U.S. and Canada modeling centers, including the CFSv2, CM2.1, GEOS-5, CCSM3.0, CanCM3, and CanCM4 models. In this study, we conduct an assessment of the predictive skill of meteorological drought using real-time NMME forecasts for the period from May 2012 to May 2014. The ensemble SPI forecasts are the equally weighted mean of the six model forecasts. Two performance measures, the anomaly correlation coefficient and root-mean-square errors against the observations, are used to evaluate forecast skill.\nSimilar to the assessment based on NMME retrospective forecasts, predictive skill of monthly-mean precipitation (P) forecasts is generally low after the second month and errors vary among models. Although P forecast skill is not large, SPI predictive skill is high and the differences among models are small. The skill mainly comes from the P observations appended to the model forecasts. This factor also contributes to the similarity of SPI prediction among the six models. Still, NMME SPI ensemble forecasts have higher skill than those based on individual models or persistence, and the 6-month SPI forecasts are skillful out to four months. The three major drought events occurred during the 2012-2014 period, the 2012 Central Great Plains drought, the 2013 Upper Midwest flash drought, and 2013-2014 California drought, are used as examples to illustrate the system's strength and limitations. For precipitation-driven drought events, such as the 2012 Central Great Plains drought, NMME SPI forecasts perform well in predicting drought severity and spatial patterns. For fast-developing drought events, such as the 2013 Upper Midwest flash drought, the system failed to capture the onset of the drought.",

            "abstract": "Definitive measurements of enhanced hydrogen concentrations linked to permanently shaded regions (PSRs) near Mercury’s north pole were made with MESSENGER’s Neutron Spectrometer (NS). These hydrogen concentrations were reported only as variations with latitude, in part because the NS data set from MESSENGER’s first orbital year had a spatial resolution of around 650 km for regions poleward of 75ºN. As a consequence, the data for these initial measurements did not allow for investigations of variations of hydrogen with longitude or enable the specification of hydrogen concentrations for individual polar deposits. Now, with new NS data that have been acquired or will be acquired during MESSENGER’s low-altitude campaign, such questions on spatial variability can be addressed. First, the average altitude in polar regions (latitude > 75ºN) will be ~200 km compared with the 430 km average altitude during the first year of data collection. This lower altitude will improve the spatial resolution by a factor of 2 and provide for a quantification of the longitudinal variation of the north polar hydrogen enhancement. Second, during early September 2014, the MESSENGER spacecraft will pass over an isolated group of three PSRs (in the craters Desprez, Bechet, and Qui Ying) at altitudes of less than 100 km. If these PSRs have sufficient water ice, as is expected on the basis of radar backscatter data, then the increase in epithermal neutron signal strength and spatial resolution may allow this group of PSRs to be spatially resolved.",

            "abstract": "Northern high-latitude peatlands accumulated an estimated 436 Gt of carbon over the Holocene. Vegetation changes, such as the succession from fen to bog species, are often clearly visible in peat profiles and can be caused by organic matter accumulation or by changes in regional climate. Most peatlands developed during the early Holocene as fens under a climate that was warmer than today due to a summer insolation maximum. Subsequent transition to bogs facilitated permafrost aggradation during the mid- to late-Holocene. Teasing out permafrost aggradation in peat cores remains a challenge, as they often resemble dry bogs. However, in many locations permafrost aggradation can be assumed especially if thermokarst is evident later in the peat record (i.e., an abrupt transition from dry bog or plateau peat to wet Sphagnum riparium or even fen peat). We used a database of existing peat core records from around the northern high latitudes to determine transition of fen to bog from plant macrofossils and determined permafrost aggradation from both plant macrofossils and physical peat properties to improve constraints on methane emissions from northern peatlands throughout the Holocene.\nHere, we examine the spatial and temporal trends of the fen to bog transition and permafrost aggradation in the northern high latitude regions by compiling a database of existing records of macrofossil assemblages and peat properties (carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density). We find that the timing of the fen-to-bog transition varied throughout the northern high latitudes, from 5200 yr BP in Alaska and Western Canada to < 1000 yr BP in Eastern Canada and Siberia. Similarly, the first occurrences of permafrost aggradation varied across the high latitudes, ranging from 4000 yr BP in Western Canada to the Little Ice Age in southern regions and parts of Western Siberia. The spatial and temporal differences in the fen to bog transition and permafrost aggradation suggest that methane emissions differed considerably across northern high latitudes throughout the Holocene. Identifying controls of the fen-to-bog transition and permafrost aggradation in the northern high latitudes has important implications for both carbon sequestration and methane emissions from northern peatlands to the atmosphere throughout the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Soil respiration (Rs) is a combination of autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). Several methods have been developed to tease out the components of Rs, such as isotopic analyses, and removing Ra input through tree girdling and root exclusion experiments. Trenching involves severing the rooting system surrounding a plot to remove the Ra component within the plot. This method has some potential limitations. Reduced water uptake in trenched plots could change soil water content, which is one of the environmental controllers of Rs in many ecosystems. Eliminating root inputs could reduce heterotrophic decomposition of SOM via lack of priming. On the other hand, the severed dead roots may temporarily increase available carbon substrate for Rh.\nAt the Harvard Forest, MA, we used the trenching method to partition Rs into its components Ra and Rh. Pre-trenched Rs was measured from spring to fall of 2012. In late fall of 2012, a trench was excavated to 1m depth around a 5x5m area, severing all roots. Plastic tarp was placed along the trench walls and then backfilled. Four automated Rs chambers were placed in the trenched plot and four in an un-trenched plot. Respiration was measured hourly for each chamber along with soil temperature and moisture from spring through fall of 2013 and 2014. Eighty root decomposition bags were placed in the organic soil horizon of the trenched (40) and un-trenched (40) plots at the time of trenching in 2012 and measured in 2013 and 2014. These data are being used to estimate the size and duration of any artifact due to root death. As expected, Rs was lower in the trenched plot (Rh only) than in the un-trenched plot (Rh + Ra) in 2013, but the reverse was unexpectedly observed during a period of low precipitation in 2014. High rates of ET combined with below-average precipitation dried the un-trenched plot to a point where Rh was inhibited, whereas less ET allowed the un-trenched plots to remain measurably wetter.",

We conducted microstructure measurements in the open water region around the Canada Basin from late summer to fall in 2009 and 2010 using RV Mirai. In the study domain, the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, ε, is typically as low level as O(10-10) W kg-1, resulting in vertical heat diffusivity of O(10-7) m2 s-1, which is close to the molecular diffusivity of heat, suggesting comparatively little predominance of mechanical turbulent mixing. An exception is the case at the Barrow Canyon, where the strong baroclinic throughflow generates substantial vertical mixing, producing ε >O(10-7) W kg-1, because of the shear flow instability. Meanwhile, in the confluence region, where the warm/salty Pacific water and the cold/fresh Arctic basin water encounter, the micro-temperature profiles revealed a localized enhancement in vertical diffusivity of heat, reaching O(10-5) m2 s-1 or greater. In this region, an intrusion of warm Pacific water creates a horizontally interleaved structure, where the double-diffusive mixing facilitates vertical heat transfer between the intruding Pacific water and the surrounding basin waters.",

We herein reappraise the metamorphic evolution of the sub-ophiolitic metamorphic units (both the metamorphic sole and the accretionnary units) of Western Turkey (i) to better characterize rock units exhumed along a cooling subduction interface, from birth to steady state (ii) to constrain the formation of metamorphic sole during the initiation of subduction (iii) and to track record of obducted ophiolite. On the basis of field and petrological observation three differents accretionnary units are reccognized with pressure-temperature estimates ranging from incipient metamorphism to blueschist-facies conditions providing information on plate coupling at different depths along the subduction interface. The upper part of the metamorphic sole was form in an amphibolite facies (garnet amphibolite - garnet clinopyroxene amphibolite). Different slices of metamorphic sole with different pressure-temperature conditions might be observed probably showing discrete timing of accretion to the upper plate. Part of the samples are characterized by a late blueschsit developpement. Both the blueschist overprint in the metamorphic sole and the high-pressure in oceanic unit were found only in the northern part of the field investigation. On the basis of the presented data, available radiometric and palaeogeographic data as well as recent themomechanical moddeling a tentative reconstruction of the subduction-zone evolution through time and the emplacement of a large-scale ophiolite is presented. Finally a comparison with ongoing work on the metamorphic sole of the Semail ophiolite of Oman is proposed with special highlights on the retrograde evolution in both settings.\n ",

            "abstract": "Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) is an emerging tool that permits autonomous and rapid high-resolution imaging of the surface expression of fault slip. Here, we explore the possibility that MLS geodesy can complement GNSS and InSAR geodetic studies of fault-related deformation. We are particularly interested in transient slip aspects of the earthquake cycle – quasi-continuous creep and post-earthquake afterslip, for example – that have proven elusive to study with other geodetic methods because of their spatially and/or temporally punctuated occurrence. We envision and test two manners of performing MLS geodesy: (1) MLS data referenced to legacy Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data sets and (2) MLS data referenced to other MLS data sets collected from a moving automobile. From 2012 to 2014, we collected multiple MLS data sets from a creeping section of Northern California’s Hayward fault near Fremont, CA; the area was also imaged in the 2007 EarthScope regional ALS survey. The study area is a suburban, residential neighborhood and was chosen, in part, so that we could utilize the stability and geometric regularity of built structures as virtual control points in the geodetic analysis. Our analysis derived an estimated offset by a least squares rigid body transformation of planar surfaces from structural features common to each data set. For the ALS-MLS technique this presents a complication because ALS data image mostly house roofs whereas MLS data image a combination of roofs and vertical walls. Using TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) data as ground truth, we find that both ALS-MLS and MLS-MLS techniques have relative accuracy capability of measuring surface fault slip at the ~1cm/yr level. Furthermore, we find good agreement between independently measured creep and the ALS-MLS derived measurement of ~6 cm over 6 years. We discuss the promise of extending this pilot work to cover a much larger portion of the Hayward fault as well as the implications and challenges related to carrying out MLS geodesy in natural environments.",

            "abstract": "Along with the recent recognition of the role of vegetation in influencing channel hydraulics, and thus fluvial morphology comes the need for scientific research on vegetation recruitment and its control factors. Flood disturbance is known to create a suitable physical template for the establishment of woody pioneers. Sapling recruitment patterns and underlying physical controls were investigated on a 5 km braided reach of the Drôme River in South-eastern France, following the 2003 50-year flood event. The approach was based on the analysis of a chronosequence of high resolution aerial images acquired yearly between 2005 and 2011, complemented by airborne LiDAR data and field observations. The study highlights how physical complexity induced by natural variations in hydro-climatic and consequently hydro-geomorphic conditions facilitates variable patterns of recruitment. The initial post-flood vegetative units, which covered up to 10% of the total active channel area in 2005, was seen to double within six years. The variability of hydro-climatic conditions was reflected in the temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment, with a pronounced peak of vegetation expansion in 2007 and a decreasing trend following higher flows in 2009. Recruitment was further seen to be sustained in a variety of geomorphic units, which showed different probabilities and patterns of recruitment. Active channels were the prominent geomorphic unit in terms of total biomass development, while in-channel wood units showed the highest probability for recruitment. Vegetation recruitment understanding is becoming crucial for predicting fluvial system evolution in different hydroclimatic contexts. Applied, these findings may contribute to improve efforts made in the field of flood risk management, as well as restoration planning.",

            "abstract": "Timely delivery of critical information to decision makers during a disaster is essential to response and damage assessment. Key issues to an efficient emergency response after a natural disaster include rapidly processing and delivering this critical information to emergency responders and reducing human intervention as much as possible. Essential elements of information necessary to achieve situational awareness are often generated by a wide array of organizations and disciplines, using any number of geospatial and non-geospatial technologies. A key challenge is the current state of practice does not easily support information sharing and technology interoperability.\nNASA E-DECIDER (Emergency Data Enhanced Cyber-Infrastructure for Disaster Evaluation and Response) has worked with the California Earthquake Clearinghouse and its partners to address these issues and challenges by adopting the XChangeCore Web Service Data Orchestration technology and participating in several earthquake response exercises.\nThe E-DECIDER decision support system provides rapid delivery of advanced situational awareness data products to operations centers and emergency responders in the field. Remote sensing and hazard data, model-based map products, information from simulations, damage detection, and crowdsourcing is integrated into a single geospatial view and delivered through a service oriented architecture for improved decision-making and then directly to mobile devices of responders. By adopting a Service Oriented Architecture based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards, the system provides an extensible, comprehensive framework for geospatial data processing and distribution on Cloud platforms and other distributed environments.\nWhile the Clearinghouse and its partners are not first responders, they do support the emergency response community by providing information about the damaging effects earthquakes. It is critical for decision makers to maintain a situational awareness that is knowledgeable of potential and current conditions, possible impacts on populations and infrastructure, and other key information. E-DECIDER and the Clearinghouse have worked together to address many of these issues and challenges to deliver interoperable, authoritative decision support products.",

This method relies on non-dispersive liquids with well-known dielectric properties. Liquids are preferred over solids or porous media to avoid air gap and heterogeneity in generally. The present work aims to compare two sensors (TDR and HYMENET) in porous media with controlled properties instead of liquids. The measurement of relative permittivity is made with an experimental protocol with four different soils. For sand type given and fixed conductivity (1, 10, 100 mS m$^{-1}$), five water contents are performed. Therefore, in total sixty different sample are prepared (hence 4$\\times$3$\\times$5 = 60).

            "abstract": "The technical complexity of measuring ENM fate and transport processes in all environments necessitates identifying trends in these same processes. As part of our research, we collected emerging information on the environmental fate and toxicity of many ENMs and investigated transportation and transformation processes in air, water, and soil. Generally, studies suggest that (i) ENMs will have limited transport in the atmosphere, because they settle rapidly; (ii) ENMs are more stable in freshwater and stormwater than in seawater or groundwater primarily due to variations in ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter; and (iii) in soil, the fate of ENMs strongly depends on the size of the ENM aggregates and groundwater chemistry, as well as pore and soil particle size. Emerging patterns regarding ENM fate, transport, and exposure combined with emerging information on toxicity indicate the risk is low for most ENMs although current exposure estimates compared with current data on toxicity indicate that at current production and release levels, exposure to Ag, nZVI, and ZnO may cause a toxic response to freshwater and marine species.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical methods can provide a non-invasive method for estimating spatial variability in hydrogeological parameters such as water content, hydraulic conductivity, and matric potential. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is unique amongst geophysical methods in that it is directly sensitive to water, via the initial signal magnitude, and thus provides a robust estimate of water content. In addition, the NMR relaxation time is sensitive to pore geometry, allowing it to be used to predict the hydraulic conductivity and to determine water retention curves. While NMR measurements are considered a mature technology in the petroleum industry, the strength of NMR data for hydrogeophysical studies is still being realized. The major ongoing challenge is to generate a functional mapping of the relationship between pore geometry and relaxation time, while accounting for pore chemistry. In our research, we are developing and refining quantitative petrophysical models that relate NMR parameters to hydrogeological parameters.\nHere we present laboratory measurements that highlight our recent successes in using NMR measurements to estimate several hydrogeological parameters and overcome the limitations of the standard petrophysical models. We examine these relationships by collecting NMR measurements on synthetic and geologic materials with carefully controlled or quantified pore properties, i.e., pore surface-area-to-volume ratio (S/V), pore size and surface iron concentration, and relate these variables to hydrogeological parameters including water content, hydraulic conductivity, and/or the water retention curve. Our major results include developing a relationship between the NMR relaxation times and water saturation across diverse chemical environments, and showing that for materials with rough surfaces, S/V, and not average pore diameter, is the relevant parameter in the interpretation of NMR data. Despite the many challenges in interpreting the measurements, valuable information about hydrogeological parameters can be obtained from NMR relaxation data, and we conclude by outlining pathways for improving the interpretation of NMR data for hydrogeophysical investigations.",

Established in 2005 with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of students studying geosciences and engineering and entering the high-tech workforce, GeoFORCE has been highly successful. Key elements to that success will be presented here.\nGeoFORCE targets bright students in rural and inner-city schools where they are generally not academically challenged. Every summer throughout high school we take them on geologic field trips all over the country. In 2014, GeoFORCE led 15 field academies for about 600 students. The program is rigorous and academic. We emphasize college-level thinking skills. Because it is a 4-year program, they have a pretty good grounding in physical geology by the time they graduate. More importantly, they develop confidence in their ability to handle college, and a strong motivation to earn a college degree. GeoFORCE students are mostly minority (85%) and more than half will be the first in their family to graduate from college. GeoFORCE students exceed national averages in rates of going to college (97%), majoring in STEM fields (66%), majoring in geosciences (15%) and engineering (13%), and graduating from college (~85%).\nGeoFORCE is a public/private partnership and a workforce-focused program. The Jackson School funds staff and operating expenses (37%). Money for student programs comes from private industry (44%), state and federal grants (14%), and foundations and individual donors (5%). Our corporate partners are in the energy sector. In addition to funding, corporate sponsors attend the summer field programs, mentor GeoFORCE students, and provide opportunities for the students to visit the companies. As our students move toward college graduation, our industry and government partners have begun to hire them as interns.\nGeoFORCE graduates are now entering the workforce. Our first two cohorts are 4 and 5 years past high school graduation. That group of 155 students boasts 70 college graduates and another 60 still pursuing degrees. There are 19 geoscience majors and 9 engineers. They are also contributing to the body of science with a growing list of publications, including at least one at this meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayas possess one of the largest resources of snow and ice, which act as a huge freshwater reservoir. Monitoring the glaciers is important to assess the overall reservoir health. In last few decades the most of the mountainous glaciers have undergone negative mass balance and terminal recessions, unlike the advancing glaciers. In this investigation, glaciers of Western Himalaya have been monitored since 1962 and variability in retreat was identified within the region. Thus, further analysis about significant parameters was taken into account to understand the relationship between glacio-morphological factors and change in glacial area. Initially change in areal extent of glaciers was derived for two time frames (1962-2001/02 and 2001/02-2010/11). The study comprised of 324 glaciers for the monitoring period of 1962-2001/02. A loss in glacial area was observed as 11% for this period. Many of these glaciers (238) were further monitored between 2001/02 and 2010/11. These glaciers showed a loss of 1.1%. The annual deglaciation has been found higher during the period of 1962-2001/02, which means rate of melting is less in this region in latest decade. Another observation in deglaciation was found spatial and temporal variability in glaciers which was addressed using glacio-morphic parameters. Areal extent of glaciers was observed to be having significant role on rate of glacial shrinkage. The another important parameter is equilibrium line altitude, i.e. the glaciers located below ELA have experienced 4.6% of deglaciation for the time frame 2001/02 – 2010/11 where as it was found to be 1.1% for the glaciers occurring above ELA. Moreover, glaciers located at lower altitude and having gentle slope show more area retreat. The results of area retreat in debris covered and debris free glaciers supports that the glaciers covered by debris retard ice melting at some extent. 158 glaciers were observed having no debris cover which shows 14% of loss in surface area. In glaciers having 40 % debris cover, 8% of deglaciation was observed. However, orientation of glaciers did not show any considerable pattern on glacial change. The study inferences that the glaciers which are debris free, located below mean altitude of snowline, smaller in size, gentle slope,and located at lower altitude has experienced higher rate of shrinkage.",

            "abstract": "In practice, it is difficult to estimate groundwater recharge accurately. Despite this challenge, most recharge investigations produce a single, best estimate of recharge. However, there is growing recognition that quantification of natural recharge uncertainty is critical for groundwater management. We present a multiple-model framework for estimating recharge uncertainty. In addition, we show how direct water flux measurements can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of total basin recharge for an arid, closed hydrologic basin in the Atacama Desert, Chile. We first formulated multiple hydrogeologic conceptual models of the basin based on existing data, and implemented each conceptual model for the purpose of conducting numerical simulations. For each conceptual model, groundwater recharge was inversely estimated; then, Null-Space Monte Carlo techniques were used to quantify the uncertainty on the initial estimate of total basin recharge. Second, natural recharge components – including both deep percolation and streambed infiltration – were estimated from field data. Specifically, vertical temperature profiles were measured in monitoring wells and streambeds, and water fluxes were estimated from thermograph analysis. Third, calculated water fluxes were incorporated as prior information to the model calibration and Null-Space Monte Carlo procedures, yielding revised estimates of both total basin recharge and associated uncertainty. The fourth and final component of this study uses value of information analyses to identify potentially informative locations for additional water flux measurements. The uncertainty quantification framework presented here is broadly transferable; furthermore, this research provides an applied example of the extent to which water flux measurements may serve to reduce groundwater recharge uncertainty at the basin scale.",

            "abstract": "Many of the difficulties in the pollen fossil-based paleoclimate reconstruction in coastal regions derive from the complex sedimentary processes of the near-shore environment. In order to examine this problem, we carried out pollen analysis of surface sediments collected from 35 sites in Osaka Bay, Japan. Using the biomisation method, the surrounding vegetation was accurately reconstructed at all sites. Applying the modern analogue technique to the same data, however, led to reconstructed temperatures that were lower by ca. 5 deg. C and precipitation amounts higher by ca. 5000 mm than the current sea level climate of the region. The range of reconstructed values was larger than the reconstruction error associated with the method. The principal component analysis shows that the surface pollen variation in Osaka Bay reflects sedimentary processes. This significant error associated with the quantitative climatic reconstruction using pollen data is attributed to the fact that the pollen assemblage is not determined solely by climate but reflects non-climatic influences. The accuracy and precision of climatic reconstruction can be improved significantly by expanding counts of minor taxa. Given this result, we re-examined the reconstructed climate using Osaka Bay palynological record reported in Kitaba et al. (2013). This new method did not significantly alter the overall variation in the reconstructed climate, and thus we conclude that the reconstruction was generally reliable. However, some intervals were strongly affected by depositional environmental change. In these, a climate signal can be extracted by excluding the patterns that arise from coastal sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "Much of the geological record can be interpreted in the context of processes operating today at plate boundaries. This works well to explain processes and products during the Phanerozoic era; during Precambrian times when the oldest rocks were forming, however, conditions on the younger, hotter, more ductile Earth were likely very different, making analogies with modern day tectonics less certain. Gathering evidence preserved deep within the plates in the shields is thus essential to improve our understanding of the early Earth. Shields are usually underlain by thick, seismically fast roots that are absent beneath younger portions of Earth's surface. The thermochemically distinct nature of cratonic roots is often associated with Archean processes such as the extraction of komatiitic magmas. However, the cratonic core of North America does not fit easily into this Archean formation paradigm: part of the Canadian shield extends beneath the Archean Superior craton, but much of it persists beneath younger Proterozoic crust as well. We present here a relative arrival-time tomographic study of mantle seismic structure using data from a new seismograph network operating in SE Canada. Our stations extend from the Archean Superior craton around the southern tip of Hudson Bay, through Proterozoic Grenville terranes, and into Paleozoic coastal Maine and Nova Scotia. Tomographic images display three broad zones of mantle wavespeed: slow in the Appalachian terranes; fast in the Grenville Province; very fast within the Superior craton. Archean lithosphere has been modified by the Great Meteor hotspot, but we find no evidence for major plate-scale underthrusting during the Grenville orogeny. The abrupt wavespeed transition from Archean to Proterozoic mantle is thus consistent with the emerging consensus that keels form in two stages: a chemically depleted layer in Archean times followed by the thermal development of a less-depleted lithosphere during Proterozoic times.",

            "abstract": "Enhanced dispersion and concentration of contaminants such as trace metals and organic pollutants through storm-induced disturbances and sea level rise (SLR) are major factors that could adversely impact the health and resilience of communities and ecosystems in coming years. As part of the response to Hurricane Sandy, the U.S. Geological Survey collected data on the effects of contaminant source disturbance and dispersion. A major limitation of conducting pre- and post-Sandy comparisons was the lack of baseline data in locations proximal to potential contaminant sources and mitigation activities, sensitive ecosystems, and recreational facilities where human and ecological exposures are probable. To address this limitation, a Sediment-bound Contaminant Resiliency and Response (SCoRR) strategy with two operational modes, Resiliency (baseline) and Response (event-based), has been designed by leveraging existing interagency networks and resources. In Resiliency Mode, sites will be identified and sampled using standardized procedures prioritized to develop baseline data and to define sediment-quality based environmental health metrics. In Response Mode, a subset of sites within the network will be evaluated to ensure that adequate pre-event data exist at priority locations. If deficient, pre-event samples will be collected from priority locations. Crews will be deployed post-event to resample these locations allowing direct evaluation of impacts, as well as redefining baseline conditions for these areas. A tiered analytical and data integration strategy has been developed that will identify vulnerable human and environmental receptors, the sediment-bound contaminants present, and the biological activity and potential effects of exposure to characterized sediments. Communication mechanisms are in development to make resulting data available in a timely fashion and in a suitable format for informing event response and recovery efforts.",

            "abstract": "Global-scale terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) vary in their underlying driving assumptions, inputs, and parameterizations. As a result, TBM estimates of carbon fluxes and pools vary greatly and the lack of direct observations of land-atmosphere carbon exchange at the same spatio-temporal resolution (e.g., 0.5° x 0.5° degree and sub-daily to monthly) of model estimates makes it difficult to assess TBM performance in terms of their ability to represent the terrestrial carbon cycle. Atmospheric CO2 measurements, however, may be a potentially powerful observational constraint for TBMs because they provide an integrated view of surface sources and sinks of carbon. The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) measures atmospheric CO2 from space at spatio-temporal scales relatively consistent with model estimates. Using TBM estimates from the North American Carbon Program Multi-scale synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), together with estimates of fossil fuel emissions and air-sea fluxes, we translate surfaces fluxes into atmospheric CO2 concentrations using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model. The performance of MsTMIP TBMs is evaluated by comparing the dry air column-averaged mole fractions of CO2 (ΧCO2) from transported surface fluxes to observations of ΧCO2 from GOSAT. While MsTMIP ΧCO2 signals are generally consistent with GOSAT ΧCO2 in the southern hemisphere, MsTMIP and GOSAT XCO2 show profound differences in the northern hemisphere (NH). In general, MsTMIP XCO2 tends to be higher than GOSAT XCO2 at northern latitudes, especially in the NH summer and fall. Looking specifically at regions in the NH, we compare each MsTMIP ΧCO2 to GOSAT ΧCO2 in terms of its ability to reproduce the spatial distribution, magnitude and timing of the GOSAT ΧCO2 seasonal cycle. We use the information derived from the comparison to link model performance with how certain processes are represented within the models themselves, thus aiding in model development and improvement.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is an exemplar of the need for improved cyberinfrastructure for its vast holdings of invaluable physical geoscience data. Millions of discrete paleobiological and geological specimens lie in USGS warehouses and at the Smithsonian Institution. These specimens serve as the basis for many geologic maps and geochemical databases, and are a potential treasure trove of new scientific knowledge. The extent of this treasure is virtually unknown and inaccessible outside a small group of paleogeoscientists and geochemists. A team from the USGS, the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA) facility, and the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) are working to expose information on paleontological and geochemical specimens for discovery by scientists and citizens. This project uses existing infrastructure of the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) and PBDB, which already contains much of the fundamental data schemas that are necessary to accommodate USGS records. The project is also developing a new Linked Data interface for the USGS National Geochemical Database (NGDB). The International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) is the identifier that links samples between all systems.\nFor paleontological specimens, SESAR and PBDB will be the primary repositories for USGS records, with a data syncing process to archive records within the USGS ScienceBase system. The process began with mapping the metadata fields necessary for USGS collections to the existing SESAR and PBDB data structures, while aligning them with the Observations & Measurements and Darwin Core standards. New functionality needed in SESAR included links to a USGS locality registry, fossil classifications, a spatial qualifier attribution for samples with sensitive locations, and acknowledgement of data and metadata licensing. The team is developing a harvesting mechanism to periodically transfer USGS records from within PBDB and SESAR to ScienceBase. For the NGDB, the samples are being registered with IGSNs in SESAR and the geochemical data are being published as Linked Data. This system allows the USGS collections to benefit from disciplinary and institutional strengths of the participating resources, while simultaneously increasing the discovery, accessibility, and citation of USGS physical collection holdings.",

            "abstract": "Quaternary mountain glaciations have greatly modified landscape and sediment production, especially after the Mid Pleistocene Transition. However, the impact of increased glacigenic sediment yields on continental margin sedimentation is poorly documented during this period in which eustasy is proposed as the dominant control on margin development. We study the provenance of sediment accumulated in the continental shelf during the Late Pleistocene, by performing 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of the bulk silt-size fraction on sediment samples from three sites drilled during IODP Expedition 317 to Canterbury Basin, New Zealand. The results show ages that range from 25 to 90 Ma, which are significantly younger than the cooling ages of the potential rock sources (>100 Ma). Bedrock cooling ages similar to our results are found adjacent to the Main Divide Fault Zone, located near the main drainage divide in Central Southern Alps. This suggests that a large proportion of sediment accumulating in the continental shelf is sourced in this region of highest elevation and maximum glacial erosion. Sediment bulk ages in the cores show younger ages up-section, suggesting that contribution of young sediment has increased and/or that glaciers have eroded younger rocks with time. In addition, sediment ages are younger in the most landward site, while the most offshore site observes young ages later indicating that the input of young sediment across the continental shelf is progressive, likely by means of sediment reworking during sea level transgression and shoreline migration during sea level fall. We propose that sediment transfer from source to sink occurs in steps in which sediment undergoes several cycles of transport and storage until final accumulation. Glacial erosion plays a very important role in this sedimentary system, supplying sediment that is likely eroded in a zone of rock weakness. The age signature of the muddy sediment accumulating in the continental shelf likely reflects Late Pleistocene landscape evolution in the Southern Alps.",

            "abstract": "Every July the University of New Hampshire sponsors a 4-week outreach program called\nProject SMART (Science and Mathematics Achievement Research Training) that is primarily aimed\nat rising high school juniors and seniors. The program attracts students from around the country\nand around the world for a 4-week residential program on the main campus. There are 3 components:\nbiotechnology and nanotechnology, space science, and marine and environmental science. The talk\nwill focus on the space science component. Mornings are spent in group projects that include\nadvanced high school classes, laboratories, and demonstrations while afternoons are spent with the\nUNH space physics faculty involved in actual research projects that are at the core of the faculty\ninterests and efforts. As a group they learn to build electronic circuits, study core physics\nquestions from momentum to relativity, and construct the payload for a high-altitude weather\nballoon that is launched at the end of the third week. This year's payload included cameras,\ntemperature sensors, a miniaturized Geiger counter, a sun sensor, a prototype UV and IR spectrometer,\nGPS, onboard central computer and power bus, and communications. While the balloon payload is a\nlot of fun, it also provides a focus for a wide range of physics and engineering issues that can\nbe incorporated into high school physics education. We have also pioneered the use of descent\nvehicles that do not require parachutes. The research projects spanned the range from magnetometer\nboom design and testing, energetic particle distributions in the magnetosphere, coronal mass ejections,\nthe heliospheric magnetic field, magnetic reconnection, etc. At the end of the month the students\npresent their work in a poster session attended by the UNH faculty.

            "abstract": "In this study, we quantify the changes in terrestrial hydrology over the conterminous U.S. from 2005 to 2095 using the Community Land Model (CLM) driven by high-resolution downscaled climate and land use/land cover (LULC) scenarios. The regional climate is downscaled using a Regional Earth System Model (RESM) with boundary conditions provided by CESM historical simulation and future projections following the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios at 20km resolution, and then bias-corrected to 0.125 degrees (~12km) resolution. The LULC change projections from a sub-national version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) that resolves state-level details of the U.S. (GCAM-USA) are also downscaled to 0.05 degree resolution for the RCP scenarios and then aggregated to 0.125 degree resolution for input to CLM.\nCLM is first run over 1975-2004 using the GCAM-USA downscaled LULC for year 2005 to simulate the hydrologic conditions in the historical period. For each RCP scenario, two CLM simulations are configured, one with the GCAM-USA downscaled LULC for the base year (i.e., 2005), the other with the time-varying GCAM-USA downscaled LULC projection from year 2005 to 2095 ingested at an annual time step, and both driven by the RESM downscaled climate. By analyzing key terrestrial hydrologic budget terms, such as runoff, evapotranspiration, root-zone soil moisture, and total terrestrial water storage, in response to simultaneous changes in climate and LULC versus climate alone, this study aims to provide insights to the relative impacts of climate and LULC changes on hydrologic processes and water resources in the U.S.",

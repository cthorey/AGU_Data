            "abstract": "Communication is key to disaster risk management before, during and after a hazardous event occurs. In this study we used a participatory design approach to increase disaster preparedness levels around Turrialba volcano (Costa Rica) in collaboration with local communities.\nWe organised five participatory workshops in communities around Turrialba volcano, 2 in February 2014 and a further 3 in May 2014. A total of 101 people attended and participants included the general public, decision makers and relevant government employees. The main finding of the workshops was that people want more information, specifically regarding 1) the activity level at the volcano and 2) how to prepare. In addition, the source of information was identified as an important factor in communication, with credibility and integrity being key. This outcome highlights a communication gap between the communities at risk and the institutions monitoring the volcano, who publish their scientific results monthly.\nThis strong and explicitly expressed desire for more information should be acknowledged and responded to. However, this gives rise to the challenge of how to communicate: how to change the delivery and/or content of the messages already disseminated for greater effectiveness.\nIn our experience, participatory workshops provide a successful mechanism for effective communication. However, critically evaluating the workshops reveals a number of challenges and opportunities, with the former arising from human, cultural and resource factors, specifically the need to develop people’s capacity to participate, whereas the latter is predominantly represented by participant empowerment.\nAs disasters are mostly felt at individual, household and community levels, improving communication, not at but with these stakeholders, is an important component of a comprehensive disaster resilience strategy. This work provides an initial insight into the potential value of participatory design approaches for communication of hazard information.",

            "abstract": "The ChemCam LIBS instrument on the Curiosity rover has observed fluorine in more than 60 locations along the traverse. These are the first fluorine detections on Mars, although the SNC meteorites contain moderate amounts of F, suggesting that is present in the Mars crust. The detection limit is < 0.4 wt % but requires the simultaneous presence of Ca in the LIBS plasma (Gaft et al., 2014). Approximately one fourth of the observations were made on conglomerate clasts in the Bradbury Rise area near the landing site, and another third were made in sediments in the Kimberley area (around sol 550). In these targets F was correlated with K, Al, and Si enrichments; in the Kimberley area they were also correlated with Li enrichments in the 10s of ppm. The most likely mineral host in these settings is muscovite and potentially also biotite.\nIn other observations the fluorine is correlated with high Ca; P was observed above the relatively high LIBS detection limit in some targets, suggesting the presence of fluorapatites. Chlorine was not found in association with fluorine. A number of these observations were made in the rocks around the aeolian drift (around sol 60). The presence of the implied apatites and mica minerals has strong implications for the petrologic environment in which these phases were formed. We will discuss the origin and possible processes that led to the presence of these fluorine-bearing targets.",

            "abstract": "Coastal flooding is the result of the non-linear interaction of multiple oceanographic, hydrological, geological and meteorological forcings (i.e., astronomical tide, monthly mean sea level, large-scale storm surge, wave set-up, wind set-up, fluvial discharges, precipitation, subsidence). Additionally, interannual variability and trends in storminess and sea level rise are climate drivers that must be considered. In many cases, some of the factors can be neglected, resulting in a relatively manageable problem from a hydrodynamic and statistical point of view. However, the contribution of each component of total water levels in San Franciso Bay (SFB) can significantly alter spatially varying flood hazards, resulting in an extraordinarily complex problem when it comes to determination of the extreme value distribution of flooding extents. The problem is even more difficult if we want to project coastal flooding risk for different climate change scenarios.\nTo address this ‘wonderful problem’, we propose a hybrid approach that combines: (a) hydrodynamic models (WWIII for waves, statistically or dynamically downscaled winds, Delft3D for high resolution tide-surge-wave modeling); (b) long-term data bases (observational and hindcast); and (c) non-linear data mining and statistical downscaling methods. At monthly scales, variability is driven by astronomic tides (perigean and nodal cycles) and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). At a daily scale, sea level pressure fields are the predictors of wind, waves and surge levels. The statistical downscaling models are based on circulation patterns for multivariate variables (Espejo et al., 2014) and on extremes (Izaguirre et al, 2012), resulting in a time-dependent climate emulators which define the hydraulic boundary conditions for Delft3D.\n",

            "abstract": "We present the current state of the ‘Comprehensive Earth Model’ (CEM), a solver-independent multi-scale model of the global distribution of density and visco-elastic parameters. The overall goal of this project is to produce a model that represents the Earth on all seismically accessible scales; which contains high resolution sub-models where data and computational concerns allow, and which presents a low wavenumber Earth in regions yet to be probed in detail. To accomplish this, we have designed the model to be independent of any particular forward solver. This allows the usage of a wide variety of forward and inverse techniques, each of which may contribute updates within their respective regimes of validity.\nIn order for these updates to be included in future releases of the CEM, they must satisfy a global reference dataset. This dataset is currently being constructed, drawing from waveform, traveltime, and normal mode catalogues, and incorporating both earthquake and ambient noise sources.\nTo support future multiscale inversions, we report on methodological developments surrounding the project, including specific interfaces with forward solvers and a suite of tools for processing gradient-based model updates. Advances in forward modelling codes, such as the porting of the spectral element solver SPECFEM3D to heterogeneous computing clusters, allows for the efficient and fully numerical calculation of sensitivity kernels on the global scale. Taking advantage of these developments, we present a global-scale transversely isotropic mantle-and-crust update to the CEM, with a misfit criterion based on waveform phase differences, and iterative nonlinear model perturbations found via adjoint techniques. Additionally, regional scale updates from both traveltime and waveform tomography are presented and discussed.\nAn open source software package has been developed, which aims to ease the processing of model updates, and which exists independently from any particular forward solver. By interpolating sensitivity kernels onto an external, regular grid, a generic collection of processing and smoothing techniques are used. This flexibility allows the package to be included in a variety of inversion workflows, from regional scale traveltime tomographies, to global scale full waveform inversions.",

            "abstract": "Automatic cameras allow acquisition of large amounts of information at high resolution in both temporal and spatial dimensions, with a roughly close range. Recently, ground cameras have been used to study the morphological evolution of fluvial environments (e.g. bank erosion, bar mobility, braided pattern changes) or to quantify components of fluvial dynamics (e.g. flow velocity, wood transport or river ice development). As the amount of information increases, automation of the data processing becomes essential, but many challenges arise to improve features detection, taking into account light contrasts, shadow and reflection, or to calculate surfaces and volumes from image orthorectification. This study illustrates the high potential of ground cameras to observe and quantify rapid, stochastic or complex events in fluvial systems and the numerous challenges we have to face. In order to automatically monitor such key fluvial processes, two ground cameras were installed. The first one was placed on the Genissiat dam (Rhône River, France) focusing on the reservoir where pieces of wood are trapped, creating a large raft. The objective is to survey wood raft area over time as a surrogate of the basin wood production. The second camera was installed along the St Jean River (Gaspesia, Québec) focusing on a pool section. The objective here is to characterize the evolution of ice cover, in terms of growing rate and ice types. The snowy environment is particularly challenging because of brightness or fairly homogeneous radiometric conditions amongst ice types. In both cases, remote sensing technics, especially feature based classification are used. Radiometric and texture indexes are used to discriminate both wood and water and ice types.",

            "abstract": "Mass and energy exchanges between soil, plants and atmosphere are key factors controlling a number of environmental processes involving hydrology, biota and climate. The understanding of these exchanges also play a critical role for practical purposes such as precision agriculture. In this contribution we present a methodology based on coupling innovative data collection and models. In particular we propose the use of hydro-geophysical monitoring via 4D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) in conjunction with measurements of plant transpiration via sap flow and evapotranspiration from Eddy Correlation (EC). This abundance of data are to be fed in spatially distributed soil models in order to comprehend the distribution of active roots. We conducted experiments in an orange orchard in Eastern Sicily (Italy). We installed a 3D electrical tomography apparatus consisting of 4 instrumented micro boreholes placed at the corners of a square (about 1.3 m in side) surrounding an orange tree. During the monitoring, we collected repeated ERT and TDR soil moisture measurements, soil water sampling, sap flow measurements from the orange tree and EC data. Irrigation, precipitation, sap flow and ET data are available for a long period of time allowing knowledge of the long term forcing conditions on the system. This wealth of information was used to calibrate a 1D Richards’ equation model representing the dynamics of the volume monitored via 3D ERT. Information on the soil hydraulic properties was collected from laboratory experiments as well as by time-lapse ERT monitoring of irrigation a few months after the main experiment, when the orange tree had been cut. The results of the calibrated modeling exercise allow the quantification of the soil volume interested by root water uptake. This volume is much smaller (an area less than 2 square meters, 40 cm thick) than generally believed and assumed in the design of classical drip irrigation schemes.",

            "abstract": "Many magmatic provinces produce strongly bimodal volcanism with abundant mafic and silicic magmas yet a scarcity of intermediate compositions (55-65 wt % SiO2). In such bimodal settings, much debate revolves around whether the basaltic magmas act as heat sources to melt pre-existing crust, or whether they are the parents to the silicic magmas (fractionation dominated evolution). Commonly, this scarcity of intermediate compositions has been used to support models involving large degrees of crustal melting.\nWe present evidence of intermediate liquids associated with rhyolite petrogenesis in a famously bimodal province, the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain (YSRP) volcanic area in the western USA. The intermediate (57-67 wt % SiO2) liquids with compositions representing liquid lines of descent are preserved as melt inclusions in pyroxene crystals from two rhyolitic ignimbrites erupted from the 6.6-4.5 Ma Heise volcanic field in eastern Idaho. The host pyroxenes also yield major and trace element compositions in equilibrium with intermediate melts prior to significant plagioclase fractionation.\nThe occurrence of such intermediate melts, most likely typically erased in the high temperature rhyolitic ignimbrites of the YSRP by diffusive re-equilibration, supports the importance of assimilation-fractional crystallisation (AFC) as a primary petrogenetic process. The crystal fractionation driving magma compositions towards the erupted rhyolites requires that unerupted cumulate reservoirs are left behind in the mid-crust – a conclusion supported by earlier seismic studies.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the Southern Ocean is an important component of the climate system, acting as a key site for carbon and heat exchange between the atmosphere and oceans. The deglaciation with its associated millenial climate changes is a key time period for testing the mechanisms behind these exchanges. Ascertaining the precise timing of these events is a challenge given complications from variable and largely unconstrained reservoir ages, dissolution of carbonate hard parts and sediment redistribution by strong currents. Nevertheless improvements to our understanding of Southern Ocean dynamics in the past requires accurately-dated proxy records that can be embedded in GCM models. Radiocarbon measured in deep-sea corals offers just such an archive and proxy. Using the skeletons of deep-sea corals we are now able to reconstruct aspects of the history of three distinct water masses in the Drake Passage on a precise timescale, allowing direct comparison to U-series dated speleothem terrestrial records and polar ice cores. We present here a new deglacial radiocarbon record from the Drake Passage which more than doubles the resolution of published records. We focus on the deglacial, as well as providing insights from the contrasting period leading up to the LGM. Together with new data from far-field sites we interpret our results as evidence for a Southern Ocean control on atmospheric carbon dioxide and radiocarbon evolution during the deglaciation, and a northern hemisphere control during the run up to the LGM.",

            "abstract": "Current global scale estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks do not account for pedogenic processes unique to permafrost environments. The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) was compiled to address this lack of knowledge of permafrost affected soils. The NCSCD links pedon data in the 0–3 m depth range from the northern permafrost regions to several digitized regional soil classification maps to produce a combined circumpolar coverage. While these different soil classification maps have been harmonized to a common soil classification system, the maps are of different origin and age and they were produced at a range of different scales (fig. 1). The spatial distribution of soil pedon data is also highly uneven with notable data-gaps in central Siberia, the High Arctic and Alpine regions.\nThe NCSCD is thus a dataset with its roots in traditional soil survey and soil map data and with substantial uncertainties and data-gaps. The original maps are subdivided into polygons where soil specialists have mapped different coverages of soil orders. The NCSCD has been gridded and is currently in use for many different model-based studies. This conversion of polygon-based data to the gridded world of spatial or process-based models can affect accuracy, precision and usability of a dataset. There are also inherent difficulties in assessing the uncertainty of stock or process quantifications based on polygon soil maps such as the NCSCD.\nSoil science is moving into a fully digital world where new maps of soil order distribution or soil properties are based on gridded remote sensing products. Such data can more easily be scaled and adapted for use in grid-based soil models. However, it is argued that the traditional soil maps are still extremely valuable data-sets that contain information that may be lost in fully digital soil mapping approaches. This presentation discusses these issues and gives some examples of how existing pedon databases and soil maps can be made useful for broad scale model applications.",

            "abstract": "Shock fronts are known to be efficient particle accelerators. At Earth, ions with energies exceeding 100 keV are frequently seen upstream of the bow shock. This energization is generally attributed to diffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become effective it is first required that the ions undergo an initial acceleration. How and where this acceleration takes place has not yet been determined, and it is one of the key unsolved issues in shock acceleration theory. There are a few proposed models, based for example on resonant wave-particle interaction or particle scattering from the quasi-perpendicular shock section, but there is yet no consensus and there is a lack of observational validation for the models. We here investigate the nature of these acceleration processes for a series of Cluster spacecraft crossings of the quasi-parallel bow shock. Focus is put on detailed observations of coherent beams within the turbulent transition region and their coupling to magnetic field pulsations and structures. By comparing the observations against predictions from theoretical models as well as with 3-D hybrid simulations, we can evaluate the potential source processes involved in the acceleration, and begin to understand the origin of the variety of magnetic and particle signatures seen in the data.",

Additionally, methodological (e.g. open system behaviour within 230Th/238U-series dating), local tectonic (i.e. site specific subsidence/uplift), and isostatic influences complicate their interpretation as markers of past sea level. Nonetheless, they remain a preeminent method for reconstructing and evaluating former sea levels during the Late Quaternary.\nOur compilation is unique as we use modern ecological depth habitat constraints to refine our reconstructions. To support the growing awareness within the palaeoclimate community of the importance of coral habitat, we provide both global and regional depth habitat ranges for each species in our reconstruction of past sea levels.\nAs such we present an internally consistent global compilation of coral benchmarks (building on the compilations of Medina-Elizalde, 2012 and Dutton and Lambeck, 2012) containing >100 studies. We include a rigorous consideration of each error term associated with these records, such as: age, depth habitat, elevation measurement, and uplift correction. We apply commonly employed age screening methods (δ234Uinitial and detrital 230Th concentrations) before undertaking a site specific assessment of each sea-level record. This includes consideration of stratigraphic integrity, replication (and any concordant age determinations) and validation of assumptions (e.g. uplift rates), where possible. Finally, we present a statistical assessment of the distribution of the data (where sufficient data density allows) within each site-specific sea-level record.\nThis presentation will show the dataset as currently compiled (>2,600 datapoints), and initial evaluations on a site-specific basis.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion modelling of elemental gradients across compositional zones within crystals is frequently used to investigate timescales of various magmatic processes. In most cases, however, only a single crystal phase is used for this modelling. The ~0.76 Ma Bishop Tuff (Long Valley, eastern California) in later parts of its eruptive sequence has zoned orthopyroxene, quartz and sanidine. It thus provides an unusual opportunity to compare the modelled timescales from each phase, and assess the limitations of single-phase diffusion modelling in lower-temperature, rhyolitic volcanic systems. The presence of a late-stage compositionally distinct melt (the ‘bright-rim’ melt) mixing into the lower parts of the Bishop magma chamber has been noted by many authors [e.g. Wark et al. 2007, Geology 35, 235; Roberge et al. 2013, CMP 165, 237; Chamberlain et al. 2014, J Petrol 55, 395] in later-erupted material discharged from vents along the northern ring fracture of the caldera.\nHere we present the results of 1D diffusion modelling of Ba and Sr in sanidine, Ti in quartz and Fe-Mg interdiffusion in orthopyroxene in samples from later-erupted ignimbrite packages in the tuff. Timescales from diffusion modelling of Fe-Mg interdiffusion in orthopyroxene are <20 years; Ti in quartz <150 years and from Ba and Sr in sanidine <10000 years. The orders of magnitude variance between different crystal phases can be attributed to either distinct differences in the timing of interaction with the ‘bright-rim’ melt, or to uncertainties in the diffusion coefficient (orthopyroxene) and incorrect assumptions about the initial conditions for diffusion modelling (sanidine), or some combination of these factors. By combined modelling of Ba and Sr diffusion in sanidine the diffusion timescales are reduced to <1000 years, implying that interaction of the ‘bright-rim' melt may have occurred over more extended timescales, and was not necessarily a direct eruptive trigger for the Bishop Tuff eruption. We highlight the importance of having a good understanding of the assumptions made and uncertainties in diffusion coefficients when undertaking such modelling, especially in examples where only one phase is available for diffusion modelling.",

            "abstract": "The use of microtremors to obtain shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles of the subsurface is becoming a widespread approach due to its various advantages. Noise measurements were carried out at four sites on Malta (Central Mediterranean). Array techniques were first tested in an area where a ≈45 m layer of soft Blue Clay (BC) overlies the harder limestone. Three array configurations (two arrays of 17 geophones in an L-shape and circle respectively and one 42 geophone array in an L-shape) were tested and processed using the f-k and two SPAC techniques: Modified and Extended SPAC. No significant difference was observed in the dispersion curve from the two short arrays despite having different shapes. However, a significant variation was observed between the dispersion curve from the long and short arrays in the low frequency part. A joint inversion, using two direct search methods, of the dispersion and the H/V curve was then used to obtain the Vs profile for the site, with most of the profiles being in agreement both in terms of velocity and depth.\nA study was also conducted at three other sites on Malta where hard Upper Coralline Limestone (UCL) overlies the soft BC creating a velocity inversion in the soil profile. The shape of the effective dispersion curves obtained using ESAC show both an inverse dispersive trend and normal dispersion. This shape is tentatively explained in terms of the presence of higher mode Rayleigh waves. A Genetic Algorithm approach was then used to jointly invert the H/V and Rayleigh wave dispersion curve. It was observed that the BC velocity was higher when overlain by a large thickness of UCL. This could be linked to the effective pressure caused by the hard UCL, making the BC more compact, and having a higher velocity. The theoretical implications of a prominent low-velocity layer on site amplification and the interpretation of ambient noise data are investigated and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning represents a major source of Black Carbon (BC) aerosol to the atmosphere, which can result in major perturbations to weather, climate and ecosystem development. Large uncertainties in these impacts prevail, particularly on regional scales. One such region is the Amazon Basin, where large, intense and frequent burning occurs on an annual basis during the dry season. Absorption by atmospheric aerosols is underestimated by models over South America, which points to significant uncertainties relating to BC aerosol properties. Results from the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field experiment, which took place during September and October 2012 over Brazil on-board the UK Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement (FAAM) BAe-146 research aircraft, are presented here. Aerosol chemical composition was measured by a DMT Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). The physical, chemical and optical properties of BC-containing particles across the region will be characterised, with particular emphasis on the vertical distribution.\nBC was ubiquitous across the region, with measurements extending from heavily deforested regions in the Western Amazon Basin, through to agricultural fires in the Cerrado (Savannah-like) region and more pristine areas over the Amazon Rainforest. Measurements in the vicinity of Manaus (a city located deep into the jungle) were also conducted. BC concentrations peaked within the boundary layer at a height of around 1.5km. BC-containing particles were found to be rapidly coated in the near-field, with little evidence for additional coating upon advection and dilution. Biomass burning layers within the free troposphere were routinely observed. BC-containing particles within such layers were typically associated with less coating than those within the boundary layer, suggestive of wet removal of more coated BC particles. The importance of such properties in relation to the optical properties of BC and its resultant impact will be investigated. The prevalence of elevated biomass burning layers above the frequent build-up of shallow cumulus clouds during the afternoon will also be characterised. This will provide improved constraint upon the highly uncertain impact of biomass burning aerosol over the region.",

            "abstract": "The fundamental physics of the generation, maintenance and propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation are intensely debated. Many theories focus on instabilities arising from interactions between components of the vertical diabatic heating from convection and the large-scale circulation. Most general circulation models (GCMs) exhibit biases in diabatic-heating profiles against observed or reanalysis products, but those products also exhibit considerable discrepancies with one another.\nThe Vertical structure and physical processes of the MJO project is a novel model-evaluation project, designed to assess relationships between diabatic processes in GCMs and their representations of the MJO. A key advantage of the project is the acquisition of temperature, moisture and momentum tendencies from each of the model sub-grid physics schemes. The project has three components, designed to take advantage of known links between biases in short-range forecasts and climate simulations: (1) 20-year AMIP-type simulations to assess the representation of the MJO in each GCM; (2) 2-day hindcasts of two YoTC MJO events to investigate the timestep-level behaviour of physical parameterisations; (3) 20-day hindcasts of the same events to identify links between degradations in forecast skill and the representation of diabatic processes.\nAnalysis of the three component has identified several over-arching conclusions. First, many process-oriented MJO diagnostics derived from past studies using one or several GCMs fail to distinguish between the GCMs in this project that simulate the MJO well and those that do so poorly, whether for initialised hindcasts or 20-year simulations. Second, there is little correlation between GCM hindcast skill for these cases and the fidelity of the MJO representation in climate simulations. Third, all three components have demonstrated that a reliable representation of the moistening profile, particularly lower- and mid-tropospheric moistening during the transition between MJO suppressed and active phases, may be critical to simulating the MJO in these GCMs. The evolution of the moistening profile during the transition phase was found to be a better determinant of MJO fidelity than the evolution of the heating profile.",

            "abstract": "The climatology and inter-annual variability of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) simulated by 34 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) are evaluated. To estimate the role of air-sea coupling, 17 CGCMs are compared to their corresponding atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). The climatological low-level monsoon circulation and mei-yu/changma/baiu rainfall band are improved in CGCMs from AGCMs. The improvement is at the cost of the local cold sea surface temperature (SST) biases in CGCMs, since they decrease the surface evaporation and enhance the circulation. The inter-annual EASM pattern is evaluated by a skill formula and the highest/lowest 8 models are selected to investigate the skill origins. The observed Indian Ocean (IO) warming, tropical eastern Indian Ocean (TEIO) rainfall anomalies and Kelvin wave response are captured well in high-skill models, while these features are not present in low-skill models. Further, the differences in the IO warming between high-skill and low-skill models are rooted in the preceding ENSO simulation. Hence, the IO-WPAC teleconnection is important for CGCMs, similar to AGCMs. However, compared to AGCMs, the easterly anomalies in the southern flank of the WPAC make the TEIO warmer in CGCMs by reducing the climatological monsoon westerlies and decreasing the surface evaporation. The warmer TEIO induces the stronger precipitation anomalies and intensifies the teleconnection. Hence, the inter-annual EASM pattern is better simulated in CGCMs than that in AGCMs.\nKey words: CMIP5, CGCMs, air-sea coupling, AGCMs, inter-annual EASM pattern, ENSO, IO-WPAC teleconnection",

            "abstract": "Decreasing Arctic sea-ice cover has been observed in recent years. Recent observed changes in the arctic and mid-latitude circulation are often perceived as response to the Arctic warming. However, the magnitude of the sea-ice forced change compared to natural atmospheric internal variability still remains unclear. In this study, two versions of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) are used to simulate the response of atmospheric circulation to the Arctic sea ice and SST anomalies of 2000’. The revised version differs from the original one only in the treatment of low-cloud: generation of low cloud is suppressed in cold condition following the work of Vavrus and Waliser (2008). A series of 120-member ensemble simulations were conducted using the two versions of the AGCM by prescribing climatological (1981–2010) and recent decade (2001–2010)’s seasonal cycle of SST and sea ice over the Arctic. Results show that the arctic atmosphere is characterized by its large internal variability. Observed arctic warming may have affected recent cold winter over mid-latitude continents, but our results suggest that its quantitative role is minor. It is also shown that simulation of atmospheric responses to arctic warming is sensitive to details of the parameterization of low cloud. The revised version simulates a negative phase of the AO when forced with the recent SST and sea ice anomalies, while the control version simulates a positive phase of the AO. The long-wave radiative feedback of low-cloud is much stronger in the revised version due to a lower mean low-cloud fraction. This difference seems to cause the contrasting atmospheric response to arctic warming.",

            "abstract": "Complex reactions between hydroxyl radicals (OH) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the lower atmosphere have a high impact on the formation/fates of airborne toxic chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter.1 Recently, air quality models have been implemented to identify OH sources, but have underpredicted OH concentrations. Studies suggest that O2 (1Δg) is produced via an energy transfer (ET) mechanism initiated by the electronic excitation of PAH and oxygenated-PAH. Energy transfer involves the formation of triplet excited state PAH which is then quenched by the surrounding ground state O2 (3∑g) resulting in excited state O2 (1Δg) formation. Excited state O2 (1Δg) is known to readily react with mono-olefins to produce organic hydroperoxides.2,3 Furthermore, the organic hydroperoxide can photodegrade to yield OH. In this study, a Nd:YAG laser coupled to a time-resolved near infrared detector was used to obtain quantum yields of O2 (1Δg) production by irradiating PAHs and oxy-PAHs at both 355 nm and 532 nm in different solvents. Select PAHs, primarily emitted by combustion engines (e.g. pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene), and their oxygenated forms (oxy-PAHs) have been identified as highly efficient O2 (1Δg) photosensitizers. For example, the measured quantum yield for pyrene in toluene was 0.90 ± 0.02. The measured quantum yields were used to calculate the photochemical rate constants for O2 (1Δg) production via ET from electronically excited PAHs and oxy-PAHs. These results were incorporated into the University of California, Irvine-California Institute of Technology (UCI-CIT) model to assess the impact on OH concentrations and the overall air quality of the South Coast Air Basin of California.\n",

Thus, every rock absorbs and reflects different wavelengths in TIR and has its own spectral signature. The TIR images are used in the thermal inertia mapping and in its approximation called apparent thermal inertia (ATI). We present the methodology and the high-resolution apparent thermal inertia maps for selected parts of Valles Marineris (Mars). ATI was calculated from surface albedo (A) and diurnal temperature difference (∆T) following the equation: ATI = (1 - A) / ∆T. Albedo was computed by dividing reflected radiation (IR) by incident radiation (II): A = IR / II. After introducing: II = F ∙ cosIA, where F stands for solar constant and IA for incident angle (°), it develops to: A = IR / (F ∙ cosIA). This formula allows us to calculate A on a horizontal surface. Calculating A on an inclined surface requires corrections of IA against relief characteristics (slopes, aspects): IAC = (IA - arctan(tans ∙ cos(e + t ∙ 15° - 180°))), where s is slope (°), e – aspect (°) and t – local solar time (h). A correction was made also for ∆T. The calibration process was more complex because it involved changes in incident radiation (II) over a given time interval (∆T = T13:00 - T6:00). II is a function of: Martian tilt, eccentricity, perihelium longitude, solar longitude (Ls, in °), latitude (φ, in °), local solar time and relief characteristics. Total II, integrated over the time interval, can be calculated following the equation [1]. The results were compared to the existing thermal inertia maps of Mars.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we compare long-term simulations performed by the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) code with observations from the MagEIS and REPT instruments on the Van Allen Probes. The model takes into account radial, energy, pitch-angle and mixed diffusion, losses into the atmosphere, and magnetopause shadowing. We consider the energetic (>100 KeV), relativistic (~0.5-1 MeV) and ultra-relativistic (>2 MeV) electrons. One year of relativistic electron measurements (μ=700 MeV/G) from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2013 are well reproduced by the simulation during a period of the various geomagnetic activity. However, for ultra-relativistic energies (μ=3500 MeV/G), the VERB code simulation overestimates electron phase space density (PSD). These results indicate that an additional loss mechanism is operational and efficient for these high energies. We discuss possible solutions for improving the modeling of the radiation belts dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities release various gaseous and particulate substances into the Earth’s atmosphere affecting air quality and climate. The greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are particularly important drivers of man-made climate change while ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols are major players in tropospheric photochemistry controlling air quality. Once released to the atmosphere the fate of man-made pollutants and climate forcers is controlled by natural removal processes.\nWe present the mission concept of the Geostationary Emission Explorer for Europe (G3E). G3E primarily aims at accurately measuring CO2 and CH4 column-average concentrations across Europe with spatial and temporal resolution of a few kilometers and a few hours, respectively. Such spatiotemporally dense imaging of the greenhouse gas concentration fields above Europe is expected to boost our ability to disentangle anthropogenic emissions from natural source and sink processes and to impose unprecedented observational constraints on surface flux quantification. In support of the retrieval and interpretation of greenhouse gas concentrations, G3E’s grating spectrometers cover a wide spectral range from the visible into the shortwave infrared. This facilitates estimates of column-average O3, CO, and aerosol abundances providing extra information on air-quality from a geostationary view. A flexible pointing design further allows for selecting focus regions beyond the European continent in order to address the surface flux budgets of other regions of interest such as tropical Africa. We demonstrate G3E’s capabilities in terms of prospective instrument design, observation concept, and retrieval performance.",

            "abstract": "Spatial, kinematical and magnitude characteristics of induced seismicity occurring during different fluid-injection stages are investigated using a high-resolution hypocenter catalog of a prominent cluster of induced seismicity at the northwestern part of The Geysers geothermal field. There, changes of the stress field orientation and relative stress magnitude were identified during two peak-injections in a previous study. These observations were interpreted as an effect of the increase in pore pressure and horizontal stress magnitudes at reservoir depth during the peak-injections.\nStudying the characteristics of this seismicity cluster in detail we find that during peak-injections seismicity occurs at greater distances from the injection point, mainly towards the north-east, i.e. parallel to the maximum horizontal stress orientation. In contrast, during lower injection rates seismicity migrates dominantly to the south and concentrates closer to the injection point. Fault plane solutions show that during peak-injection intervals the percentage of strike-slip and/or thrust faulting events increases and the seismic moment released by the strike-slip events is higher on average than that of normal faulting events. The b values decrease during peak-injections, suggesting the increase in differential stresses at the reservoir during these periods.\nThe observed differences in the seismicity characteristics during the different injection stages could be related to variable influence of physical mechanisms inducing seismicity. Prior to peak-injections, the seismicity might be predominantly connected with the thermal fracturing of the reservoir rock. However, during peak injections, the limited pore pressure increase (~1MPa) may play a significant role, even though pore pressure remains under hydrostatic values. By estimating the reservoir permeability and the thermal and hydraulic diffusivities, we confirm that the pore pressure propagation front reaches a greater distance from the injection point than the corresponding thermal propagation front.",

            "abstract": "Paleolatitudes for the Tibetan Himalaya Zone based on paleomagnetic inclinations provide kinematic constraints of the passive northern Indian margin and the extent of ‘Greater India’ before the India-Asia collision. Here, we present a paleomagnetic investigation of the Jurassic (carbonates) to Lower Cretaceous (volcaniclastic rocks) Wölong section of the Tibetan Himalaya in the Everest region. The carbonates yield positive fold tests, suggesting that the remanent magnetizations have a pre-folding origin. However, detailed paleomagnetic analyses, rock magnetic tests, end-member modeling of acquisition curves of isothermal remanent magnetization, and petrographic studies reveal that the magnetic carrier of the Jurassic carbonates is authigenic magnetite, whereas the dominant magnetic carrier of the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic rocks is detrital magnetite. We conclude that the Jurassic carbonates were remagnetized, whereas the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastics retain a primary remanence. We hypothesize that remagnetization of the Jurassic carbonates was probably caused by the oxidation of early diagenetic pyrite to magnetite within the time interval at ~86-84 Ma during the latest Cretaceous Normal Superchron and earliest deposition of Cretaceous oceanic red beds in the Tibetan Himalaya.\nThe remagnetization of the limestones prevents determining the size of ‘Greater India’ during Jurassic time. Instead, a paleolatitude of the Tibetan Himalaya of 23.8±2.1° S at ~86-84 Ma is suggested. This value is lower than the expected paleolatitude of India from apparent polar wander path (APWP). The volcaniclastic rocks with the primary remanence, however, yielded a Lower Cretaceous paleolatitude of Tibetan Himalaya of 55.5±3° S, fitting well with the APWP of India.",

They are known as very geoeffective events, capable to trigger strong storms in the terrestrial environment. Statistical studies that address their geoeffectiveness show dependence on their orientation in the interplanetary medium, on preceding or trailing events, … Before interacting with the magnetosphere, they cross the terrestrial bow shock and the magnetosheath. From CLUSTER observations in the magnetosheath, we show that their magnetic structure can be similar or modified downstream of the bow shock, and in some cases it presents a large rotation relative to upstream direction. The orientation of the magnetic field and in particular the orientation of the Bz component is crucial for the development of geomagnetic activity inside the magnetosphere. From observations and from simple modeling, we examine the configurations where the terrestrial bow shock is responsible for a modification of the clouds' magnetic field orientation and even for its reversal. We show that this depends on the configuration quasi-parallel/quasi-perpendicular at the shock and discuss the possible consequences for the geomagnetic activity.",

            "abstract": "SKB has submitted a license application for a spent nuclear fuel repository at Forsmark sited in crystalline rocks of the Fennoscandian shield. In support of this application various quantitative assessments were made to demonstrate the long-term safety of the proposed repository. One such assessment involved simulation of groundwater chemical evolution to quantify impacts on safety functions for the disposal system related to the geochemical conditions, particularly salinity, pH and redox conditions. In the reference case the current temperate period lasts until 12,000 AD. A case of prolonged meteoric infiltration to 60,000 AD is also considered resulting from e.g. global warming. This is to fulfil a regulatory request to assess whether extended dilute water infiltration might lead to a rise in redox potential and also to an increase in erosion of the bentonite barrier due to formation of colloids. In order to perform long transient simulations of groundwater flow and solute transport with water-solute-rock interactions, new tools have been developed to closely couple geochemical, groundwater flow and transport calculations, and perform these efficiently using parallel computing techniques. In assessing this case, sensitivities are tested to the geochemical reaction schemes appropriate to the site. The results of this work predict that the chemical environment at repository depth stabilises at around 20,000 AD and shows little change beyond that. The salinity of the groundwater is governed by the low permeability (c. 10-19 m2) of the bedrock and by rock matrix diffusion, resulting in relatively shallow and slow circulation of groundwater. The chemical reactions influence concentrations of reactive species, the calculated pH and redox potential. In particular, the redox reactions thought to be relevant for the Forsmark site maintain reducing conditions at repository depth, even with infiltration at the ground surface of meteoric water with relatively high redox potential.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slip occurred just before the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake on a shallow portion (less than 20 km depth) in the Tohoku subduction zone (Ito et al., 2013). The area where slow slip occurred overlapped with the seismogenic zone. To understand such diverse slip behaviour around the Japan Trench, not only the major earthquakes but also the slow slip events, it is essential to reveal the frictional properties of rocks distributed at the Tohoku subduction zone. We thus conducted friction experiments using a rotary shear apparatus on smectite-rich pelagic sediments retrieved from the plate-boundary thrust during IODP Expedition 343. The sediments were disaggregated and simulated gouges were then sheared at temperatures of 20-200oC, an effective normal stress of 50 MPa and a pore fluid pressure of 50 MPa. We conducted velocity-stepping sequences (0.3 to 100 µm/s) to determine the rate and state parameter (a-b) and investigated the effects of temperature and slip rate on slip stability.\nOur results show that at low temperatures of 20 and 50oC, the simulated gouges exhibit negative values of (a-b) with a background friction coefficient of 0.38, except at the highest slip rate of 0.1 mm/s. However, the gouges show neutral to positive values of (a-b) at temperatures of >100oC with the same background friction coefficient as at lower temperatures. In addition, the value of parameter (a-b) depends significantly on slip rates: at temperatures of 20 and 50oC it increases from negative to neutral (or slightly positive at 20oC) with increasing slip rates to 0.1 mm/s, whereas it tends to decrease with increasing slip rate at temperatures higher than 100oC. The downdip temperature limit of the slow slip events at Japan Trench (Ito et al., 2013) seems to be in the range between 100 to 150oC. The transition in (a-b) value from neutral to positive, particularly at lower slip rates, occurs at the same temperature range. Hence, this could correspond to the observed downdip limit of the slow slip events. Furthermore, at the lowest temperature of 20oC this transition also occurs, but with increasing slip rate. This frictional property may thus inhibit further slip acceleration even if the slip commences, and could thus represent the upper limit of slow slip events at the shallow portion of the plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "The role of sea ice in the Earth climate system is poorly defined, although its influence albedo, ocean circulation and atmosphere-ocean heat and gas exchange, in particular there is lack of information about its behaviour in the past. Different approaches have been proposed and used for the past reconstruction of sea ice. Attention has been given to sediment core in which measurement of diatomean assemblage has been discovered to respond to sea ice fluctuations. Recently a class of compounds, the highly branched isoprenoids (in particular the IP25) have been proposed as possible tracers for past sea ice extension. Other strategies have been used to evaluate the sea ice changes, for example multy-proxy approach (Kinnard et al. 2011) but for ice cores the question is still open. Sodium (Na) and Methanesulphonic acid (MSA) are now suggested as possible proxy. Sodium reflects glacial-interglacial sea ice variability but on shorter timescales is strongly influenced by meteorology (Levine et al. 2014). Methanesulphonic Acid, correlates with satellite observations of sea ice extent off the East Antarctic coast, but is reactive and remobilized in ice cores over centennial time scales (Curran, et al. 2003; Rothlisberger et al. 2010). In parallel we propose iodine and bromine, as a possible tracers for past sea ice changes. Bromine is actively involved in destruction chemistry of polar ozone via auto-catalyzed reactions called “Bromine explosions”, which occur above seasonal sea ice and causing an excess of bromine in the snow deposition compared to the sea water ratio. Iodine is emitted from algal communities growing under sea ice and then, percolating up to the sea ice surface, it is emitted into the polar atmosphere. We investigate the halogens signal in different sites and with different time coverage; measurements have been carried out in Greenland, Svalbard and Antarctica. We first investigate the conservation of the climate signal in the recent depositions (~3 years coverage) and then we extend the evaluation on a decal, centurial and millennia time scale. The results suggest the connection of Bromine excess with seasonal sea ice extension; Iodine signal shows a different behaviour between the two Poles, hypothetically because of the difference in sea ice physical characteristics, but some questions have to be clarified.",

Field observations were combined with different methods of inversion of fault-slip heterogeneous data and with the use of different open-source computer programs that calculate resolved stress tensors and P-T axes for each structural site in order to unravel the significance of this complex architecture. The results of the inversion of fault-slip analysis show that a transtensional strike-slip regime, with NE-SW-trending subhorizontal σ1, predominate in the first and second order faults in the northern termination of the duplex. A more local tensional regime was calculated for the same area. The inversion solutions are compatible with NE-trending subvertical veins system and dilational jogs and breccia. In contrast, within the central area of the duplex fault slip inversion of fault populations shows both transpressional and compressional regimes. The first tectonic regime is compatible with ENE-striking veins and dikes. In the southern part of the duplex, fault populations are compatible with either a local transtensional stress field with an ESE-trending subhorizontal σ1 or with a tensional regime with a SW-trending, steeply plunging σ1. Our results show the complexity in the nature and spatial distribution of stress fields within strike-slip duplexes and its role in the geometrical distribution of paleo-fluid flow, part of which may account for the reactivation of inherited faults or strain incompatibilities at fault intersections.",

            "abstract": "Conceptual models for problem framing in environmental (EIA) and health impact assessment (HIA) share similar concepts, but differ in their scientific or policy focus, methodologies and underlying causal chains, and the degree of complexity and scope. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework used by the European Environment Agency, the OECD and others and the Integrated Science for Society and the Environment (ISSE) frameworks are widely applied in policy appraisal and impact assessments. While DPSIR is applied across different policy domains, the ISSE framework is used in Ecosystem Services assessments. The modified Driver-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) model extends DPSIR by separating exposure from effect, adding context as a modifier of effect, and susceptibility to exposures due to socio-economic, demographic or other determinants. While continuously evolving, the application of conceptual frameworks in policy appraisals mainly occurs within established discipline boundaries. However, drivers and environmental states, as well as policy measures and actions, affect both human and ecosystem receptors. Furthermore, unintended consequences of policy actions are seldom constrained within discipline or policy silos. Thus, an integrated conceptual model is needed, accounting for the full causal chain affecting human and ecosystem health in any assessment. We propose a novel model integrating HIA methods and ecosystem services in an attempt to operationalise the emerging concept of “Ecological Public Health.” The conceptual approach of the ecosystem-enriched DPSEEA model (“eDPSEEA”) has stimulated wide-spread debates and feedback. We will present eDPSEEA as a stakeholder engagement process and a conceptual model, using illustrative case studies of climate change as a starting point, not a complete solution, for the integration of human and ecosystem health impact assessment as a key challenge in a rapidly changing world.\nRayner G and Lang T Ecological Public Health: Reshaping the Conditions for Good Health.

            "abstract": "To shed light on the coupled dynamics of near surface and deep fluid systems in a sedimentary basin on various scales, ranging from the pore scale to the extent of an entire basin, is the overall goal of INFLUINS (INtegrated FLuid dynamics IN Sedimentary basins). To do so is essential to understand the functioning of sedimentary basins fluid systems. An integral INFLUINS topic also is the potential interaction of aquifers within a basin and at its rims.\nRegionally, INFLUINS is focusing on the Thuringian basin, a well-confined, intra-continental sedimentary basin in central Germany as a natural geo-laboratory. The Thuringian basin is composed of sedimentary rocks from the latest Paleozoic and mainly Triassic and particularly suited to undertake such research as it is of relative small size, about 50 times 100 km, easily accessible, and quite well known from previous studies. INFLUINS consists on several projects tightly connected to each other and coming from various disciplines of geosciences including among others geophysics, hydrogeology, sedimentology, mineralogy, and remote sensing. A deep drilling campaign, which took place close to Erfurt in the center of the basin in summer 2013, is one of the main achievements of INFLUINS.\nIn preparation for deep drilling, in 2011, we conducted an extensive seismic reflection site survey, in the framework of which the center of the basin down to the top basement was imaged in high quality. Drilling went down to a depth of 1179 m, drilling Triassic rocks from Keuper to lower Buntsandstein and led to more than 500 m of cores of excellent quality and more than 600 cuttings samples. Down-hole geophysical logging over the entire depth of the drill hole is complemented with Multi Sensor Core Logging leading to an extensive geophysical data set with a spatial resolution up to the cm-scale.\nHere, we present overall results of the drilling campaign and focus on the boundaries between major groups as well as between prominent beds including e.g. rock salt and other pronounced aquitards.",

            "abstract": "River delta shorelines may be characterized by complex patterns of sediment transport and sequestering at various timescales in response to changes in sediment supply, hydrodynamic conditions, and deltaic self-organization. While being good indicators of delta stability, these changes also have important coastal management and defence implications. These aspects are examined with reference to the mouths of the Mekong River delta, the world’s third largest delta, backbone of the Vietnamese economy and home to nearly 20 million people. We conducted an analysis of shoreline fluctuations over the last five decades using low-resolution Landsat (1973-2014), very high-resolution SPOT 5 (2003-2011) satellite imagery, topographic maps (1950, 1965), and field hydrodynamic and shoreline topographic measurements. The results show that the 250 km-long river-mouth sector of the delta shoreline has been characterized by overall accretion but with marked temporal and spatial variations. The temporal pattern is attributed to fluctuations in sediment supply due to both human activities and natural variations in catchment sediment loads (e.g., 2000-2003), and natural adjustments in delta-plain sediment storage and delivery to the coast. The spatial pattern is indicative of discrete sediment cells that may be a response to an overall decreasing sand supply, especially since 2003, following increasingly massive riverbed mining with concomitant losses in channel-bed sand. Field measurements show the prevalence of mesotidal bar-trough beaches characterized by sand migration to the southwest in response to energetic dry-season monsoon waves. Beaches underfed as a result of both wave-energy gradients and possible diminishing sand supply from the adjacent river mouths are eroded to feed accreting beaches. Understanding this cell pattern has important implications in terms of: (1) interpreting past patterns of shoreline translation involved in the construction of successive beach ridges that characterise the prograding mouths sector of the Mekong; (2) linking shoreline stability/instability with coastal sand supply by the Mekong River and the impacts of human activities on this supply; (3) shoreline management and defence planning in the critical sandy river-mouth sector of this densely populated delta.",

            "abstract": "The mobility of alloying elements in liquid iron has important kinetic implications for timescales and processes occurring in metallic cores and core-mantle boundaries of differentiated bodies. According to current models of the Earth’s core-mantle segregation, substantial amounts of light elements (Si and/or O), as well as Cr, should have partitioned from a magma ocean into metallic Fe-Ni cores of planetesimals during accretion. In contrast to these predictions, however, the Si, O, and Cr contents of iron meteorites, which are derived from the metallic cores of early-formed planetesimals, are surprisingly low (e.g. < 1 ppm). The partitioning of Si, O, and Cr into liquid iron has been shown experimentally to increase with temperature so that that the alloy component of a planetesimal core should decrease during cooling. Ongoing metal-silicate interaction at the CMB of larger bodies, such as the Earth, and potential diffusive profiles of light elements in the outmost region of the Earth’s outer core have been used to model and interpret deviations from reference model seismic wave speeds in these respective regions. We are conducting a series of high P-T experiments and first principles calculations to constrain the diffusivity of Si, O, and Cr in liquid iron in order to understand the kinetics of chemical transport and equilibration during core formation and processes occurring at CMBs.\nExperimental diffusion couples comprised of highly polished cylindrical disks of 99.97% Fe and metallic Fe alloy (Fe6Si, Fe12Si, Fe9O, Fe92Cr, Fe85Si14Cr) were contained in an MgO capsule and annealed within the P-T range 1642–2573 K and 3–18 GPa in a multi-anvil apparatus. A series of experiments are conducted at each pressure using variable heating rates, final temperatures (Tf), and time duration at Tf. To extend our dataset to P-T conditions of the Earth’s core-mantle boundary, we have begun first principles molecular dynamics (FP-MD) calculations. Fe supercells are overheated to induce melting, compressed along several isotherms (2000–5000K) and allowed for changes in chemistry (Si, O, Cr) and alloy concentration. Diffusion coefficients are computed from the atomic trajectories in the simulation cell via the Einstein relation.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, pore scale studies have become the key to understanding the complex fluid flow processes in the fields of groundwater remediation, hydrocarbon recovery and environmental issues related to carbon storage and capture. A pore scale study is often comprised of two key procedures: 3D pore scale imaging and numerical modelling techniques. The essence of a pore scale study is to test the physics implemented in a model of complicated fluid flow processes at one scale (microscopic) and then apply the model to solve the problems associated with water resources and oil recovery at other scales (macroscopic and field). However, the process of up-scaling from the pore scale to the macroscopic scale has encountered many challenges due to both pore scale imaging and modelling techniques. Due to the technical limitations in the imaging method, there is always a compromise between the spatial (voxel) resolution and the physical volume of the sample (field of view, FOV) to be scanned by the imaging methods, specifically X-ray micro-CT (XMT) in our case\nIn this study, a careful analysis was done to understand the effect of voxel size, using XMT to image the 3D pore space of a variety of porous media from sandstones to carbonates scanned at different voxel resolution (4.5 μm, 6.2 μm, 8.3 μm and 10.2 μm) but keeping the scanned FOV constant for all the samples. We systematically segment the micro-CT images into three phases, the macro-pore phase, an intermediate phase (unresolved micro-pores + grains) and the grain phase and then study the effect of voxel size on the structure of the macro-pore and the intermediate phases and the fluid flow properties using lattice-Boltzmann (LB) and pore network (PN) modelling methods. We have also applied a numerical coarsening algorithm (up-scale method) to reduce the computational power and time required to accurately predict the flow properties using the LB and PN method.",

Due to anthropogenic activities based on fossil fuel consumption (mainly gas heating and traffic) and cement production, inventories relate that Paris region emits about 55 millions of tons of CO2. These estimates come from inventories that are based on benchmarked emission factors and activity proxies. They are not verified independently, highlighting the need for developing new tools of monitoring-reporting-verifying Paris CO2 emissions. Since emissions are diluted into the atmosphere, atmospheric measurements and inverse transport modeling constitute tools of choice to develop such new methods, that one would ideally design to be useful for a large number of urbanized areas. Especially, when fossil fuels are burned, the combustion process leads to the atmospheric emission of not only CO2 but also CO and several other species that are specific of each combustible. Furthermore, the ratio of each species to CO2 is characteristic of the emission source, allowing the possible identification of the relative role of the different emission sectors on the total plume of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. In the framework of several projects (CO2-Megaparis, Multi-CO2, Primequal-Zapa), one year of CO2 and CO in-situ measurements were monitored in Paris region. For a few weeks several other species were collected such as NOx, carbon isotopes (d12C, d13C, D14C) and volatile organic compounds. In this work, we will present the analysis of CO/CO2 ratios over a year but also an overwiew of the main results obtained through the analysis of correlations between CO2, NOx, VOCs and carbon isotopes collected during intensive campaigns in Paris.",

            "abstract": "Valles Marineris is the most significant near-linear depression on Mars. It is some 4000 km long, up to about 200 km wide and some 7 km deep. Although its margins look parallel at first sight, the entire structure has a long spindle shape with significant enlargement in its middle (Melas Chasma) caused by cuspate slope retreat mechanisms. Farther to its north is Hebes Chasma which is an entirely closed depression with a more pronounced spindle shape. Tithonium Chasma is a parallel, but much narrower depression to its northeast. All these chasmae have axes parallel with one another and such structures occur nowhere else on Mars. A scabland surface exists to the east of the Valles Marineris and the causative water mass seems to have issued from it.\nThe great resemblance of these chasmae on mars to poljes in the karstic regions on earth have led us to assume that they owed their existence to dissolution of rock layers underlying them. We assumed that the dissolving layer consisted of water ice forming substantial layers, in fact entirely frozen seas of several km depth. We have simulated this geometry by using bentonite and flour layers (in different experiments) overlying layers of ice in which a resistant coil was used to simulate a dyke. We used different thicknesses of bentonite and flour overlying ice layers again of various thicknesses. The flour seems to simulate the Martian crust better because on Mars, g is only about 3/8ths of its value on Earth, so (for equal crustal density) the depth to which the cohesion term C remains important in the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure criterion is about 8/3 times greater. As examples we show two of those experiments in which both the rock analogue and ice layers were of 1.5 cm. thick. Perfect analogues of the Valles Marineris formed above the dyke analogue thermal source complete with the near-linear structure, overall flat spindle shape, cuspate margins, a central ridge, parallel side faults, parallel depressions resembling the Tithonium Chasma. When water was allowed to drain from the beginning, closed depressions formed that have an amazing resemblance to Hebes chasma. We postulate that the entire system of chasmae here discussed formed atop a major dyke swarm some 4000 km length, not dissimilar to the 3500 km long Mesoproterozoic (Ectasian) dyke swarm disrupting the Canadian Shield.",

Here we present results from a field study in 16 unproductive headwater lakes in northern subarctic and boreal Sweden where N deposition is low. We assessed the C:N:P stoichiometry of lake water, seston and zooplankton and estimated the consumer driven nutrient regeneration N:P ratio. The elemental imbalances between seston and zooplankton indicated that zooplankton were mainly N limited and regenerated nutrients with low N:P ratios (median 9.7, atomic ratio). The N:P regeneration ratios declined with increasing DOC concentrations, suggesting that catchment release of DOC accentuates the N limitation by providing more P to the lakes. The N:P regeneration ratios were related to responses in phytoplankton bioassays in mid-summer with low N:P regeneration with N limited phytoplankton, and high N:P regeneration with P limited phytoplankton. During other seasons, increased nutrient loading from the surrounding catchments during periods of greater water throughput had stronger effects on phytoplankton nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that herbivore zooplankton are N limited and recycle nutrients with low N:P ratio in low productive lakes with low N deposition. This will, at least during seasons when in-lake processes play an important role in nutrient turn over, contribute to continued N limitation of phytoplankton in these systems. We anticipate that increased N deposition and changes in climate and hydrology may affect this feedback and result in qualitative changes in these ecosystems, changing both autotroph producers and herbivore consumers from N- to P-limitation, eventually affecting important ecosystem characteristics such as productivity and turnover of energy and nutrients.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of reaction kinetics of fluid/rock interactions represents a critical issue for several geological and engineering concerns. In the specific context of geothermal energy, the relative intensities of primary mineral leaching and secondary phase formation significantly affect porosity and permeability of the reservoir, thereby influencing its hydraulic performance and the efficiency of a geothermal site. Moreover, it is noteworthy that in general, the circulation of aqueous fluids induces only modest modifications of their chemical composition, which slightly deviate from an equilibrium state. Therefore, fluid rock interactions take place at close-to-equilibrium conditions, where the rate-affinity relations are poorly known and intensively debated [1].\nTo unravel these points, in the context of the geothermal power station of Soultz-sous-Forêts (Alsace, France), our strategy consists in (1) investigating the dissolution of the main cleavages of K-spar, one of the prevalent primary minerals in the reservoir, in order to decipher the impact of crystallographic orientation and microstructural surface modifications on the dissolution kinetics and (2) proposing a relation between K-spar dissolution rate and the Gibbs free energy of reaction (∆G) over a wide range of ∆G conditions.\nOur experimental work relies on a coupled approach which combines classical experiments of K-spar dissolution monitored by aqueous chemical analyses (ICPAES) and innovative techniques of nm to μm-scale characterization of solid surface (FIB-TEM, AFM, VSI) [2].\nOur ongoing experiments evidence that K-spar dissolution is an anisotropic process, with faces (-1-1 1) dissolving up to ten times faster than the slowest (001) faces. The complex evolution of surface topography with the occurrence of etch pits is at odds with the shrinking core model implemented in most of reactive-transport codes, representing a possible cause of an apparent modification of silicate dissolution rate over time. In addition, the relation between K-spar dissolution rate and ∆G seems to differ from the transition state theory currently implemented into geochemical codes. Taken together, these new findings show promise as a means for modifying reactive transport codes and improving the predictive ability of geochemical simulations.",

            "abstract": "The bathymetric and magnetic survey, hydrocasting and seabed sampling have been carried out in the middle portion of the Central Indian Ridge (MCIR) between 7°S and 17°S. The MCIR constitutes six first-order segments and seven second-order segments with four non-transform discontinuities (NTDs) and twelve ocean core complexes (OCCs). These segments are characterized by asymmetric accretion that corresponds to about 70% of the surveyed MCIR segment. One of the outstanding NTD in the area is a basin like NTD3-1 at 11°S (50km in length) which strike at 035°, approximately 45° oblique in a clockwise direction to the orientation of two adjoining second-order segments. The hydrothermal activity is recognized at the tips of NTD3-1. No abyssal hills paralleling to basin-shape NTD3-1 are observed. Anomalous depth of the basin, lack of positive magnetic anomaly across the basin and rare seismic activities in the basin floor suggests that extensional tectonism with a sparse volcanism is the dominant process occurring along the NTD3-1. Based on the previous researches that the counterclockwise rotation of ridge is predominant in the area, the region of NTD3-1 largely accommodates shear strain by left-lateral sense motion and consequently forms a transtensional basin, i.e., a pull-apart basin. The strong and frequent hydrothermal plume signals, and highly tectonized rocks in both tips of the NTD3-1 are reflective of the dilation zones or tensional fractures accompanied by the pull-apart basin formation. It is the first identification of a pull-apart basin associated with hydrothermal activity in the Central Indian Ridge.",

In remote areas, the atmosphere is characterized by low particle number concentrations and high humidity; perturbations in the particle number concentrations and climate-relevant physical and chemical properties could therefore have a great impact on cloud formation and thus on regional climate and precipitation. While it was previously believed that new particle formation occurs rarely in the Amazon, observations in the Amazon of a sustained steady-state particle number concentration, along with an abundance of dry and wet surfaces upon which particles may deposit, imply that sources of new particles must exist in this region.\nWe present observations from two studies, GOAmazon2014 and Tapajos Upwind Forest Flux Study (TUFFS), which seek to identify and quantify the sources of aerosol particles in the Amazon. Measurements of the chemical composition of 20 – 100 nm diameter aerosol particles at the T3 measurement site during the wet and dry season campaigns of GOAmazon2014 show the presence of inorganic ions such as potassium ion and sulfate, as well as organic ion such as oxalate, in ambient nanoparticles. These observations, combined with 1.5 – 300 nm diameter particle number size distributions and trace gas measurements of organic compounds and sulfuric acid, are used to determine the relative importance of sulfuric acid, organic compounds, and primary biological particle emissions to nanoparticle formation and growth. Observations of 3 – 100 nm diameter particle number size distributions at the KM67 tower site during TUFFS show frequent new particle formation events during the wet season in April, transitioning to a scenario of less frequent events in July at the onset of the dry season. These observations highlight the regional nature of new particle formation in the Amazon, and suggest that additional observations at a variety of locales are needed to fully understand the roles of new particle formation in this region.",

            "abstract": "Here we extend the numerical convection models of Venus models of [1], which included melting, magmatism, decaying heat-producing elements, core cooling, realistic temperature-dependent viscosity and either stagnant lid or episodic lithospheric overturn. In [1] it was found that for stagnant lid convection the dominant mode of heat loss is magmatic heat pipe, which requires massive magmatism and produces very thick, cold crust, inconsistent with observations. In contrast, episodic lid overturn interspersed by periods of quiescence effectively loses Venus’s heat while giving lower rates of volcanism and a thinner crust. Calculations predict 5–8 overturn events over Venus’s history, each lasting ∼150 Myr, initiating in one place and then spreading globally. Venus-like amplitudes of topography and geoid can be produced in either stagnant or episodic modes, with a viscosity profile that is Earth-like but shifted to higher values. Here we extend [1] by considering intrusive magmatism as an alternative to the purely extrusive magmatism previously assumed. Intrusive magmatism warms and weakens the crust, resulting in substantial surface deformation and a thinner crust. This is further enhanced by using a basaltic rheology for the crust instead of assuming the same rheological parameters as for the mantle. In some cases massive intrusive magmatism can even lead to episodic lithospheric overturn events without plastic yielding. Here we quantitatively analyse the resulting surface deformation and other signatures, and compare to observations in order to constrain the likely ratio of intrusive to extrusive magmatism.\n[1] Armann, M., and P.

            "abstract": "Speleothems have emerged as one of the best sources of terrestrial palaeoclimate information. They have the potential to preserve long and continuous records, contain multiple climate-sensitive properties and can be accurately and precisely dated. These characteristics ideally position speleothems to refine the chronology of climate events recorded in ice and marine sediment. In recent years we have seen a dramatic improvement in analytical instrumentation available for high-resolution, in situ stable isotope and trace element analysis. These techniques present the opportunity to obtain palaeoclimate reconstructions from slow-growing speleothems, such as subaqueous deposits, which have largely been overlooked for palaeoclimate research. Here, we present the use of microanalytical techniques to obtain a ‘high-resolution’ palaeoclimate reconstruction from an exceptionally slow growing (~0.3 mm kyr-1) subaqueous calcite mound from Corchia Cave, NW Italy. A 23-cm-long core through this speleothem provides a ~continuous climatic record extending back almost 1 Ma. In this pilot investigation, we use microanalytical techniques to obtain a palaeoclimate reconstruction from the top ~2 cm of the core, which represents the last ~120 kyr. Micron-scale trace element analyses were performed by X-ray micro-fluorescence at the ESRF (Grenoble, France), with complementary analyses using laser ablation ICPMS at the University of Melbourne (Australia). Stable oxygen isotope microanalysis was performed using the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro Probe Stable Isotope (SHRIMP SI) at the ANU (Canberra, Australia). This is the first time that this suite of techniques has been applied to a single specimen of speleothem calcite. High-resolution uranium-thorium dating has been undertaken to provide age constraints. This research demonstrates the potential application of multiple high-resolution analytical techniques to complex speleothems, and presents exciting opportunities to analyse slow-growing speleothems and to obtain high temporal (sub-annual) resolution palaeoclimate reconstructions. The successful application of such techniques to the Corchia speleothem will permit a unique, 1 Myr climate record to be obtained in the future.",

A magnetotelluric (MT) profile crossing the eastern margin of WB, southern TNCO and western margin of EB, combined with a subset of SinoProbe MT array near this profile is used in our study. Dimensionality analysis indicates that (a) the resistivity structure is nearly 2-D with geoelectric strike directions varying in different tectonic units, and that (b) electrical anisotropy may exist in the mid-lower crust beneath the Shanxi Rift and Qinshui Basin. Isotropic and anisotropic 2-D inversion and isotropic 3-D inversions have been conducted. The most significant resistivity features in the inversion models are a series of mid-lower crustal sub-horizontal blob-like conductors beneath Shanxi Rift and an east-dipping conductor extending from mid crust to a depth greater than 150 km beneath the southern Taihang Mountains. Inversions show that the crustal conductor series may represent an anisotropic layer, likely caused by conductive materials filling a network of fractures with preferred spatial orientation. The dipping conductor may represent a conduit of hot asthenospheric materials transporting upwards, which is interpreted to the leading edge of the eastward escape mantle flow caused by Indian-Asia collision. The hot materials are inferred to be resulted from the westward mantle convection associated with the westward subducting Pacific Slab, going upward into the mid-lower crustal detachment zone and heat the rock, generating partial melts filling the fractures beneath Shanxi rift. The rift system is believed to be associated with NW–SE-trending extensional stress field resulted from the rapid convergence of India–Eurasia. Thus, conclusion can be drawn that the deformation of the lithosphere beneath NCC, especially the TNCO, may be a far-field effect of Indian-Asia collision.",

For the sounding, the lander part of CONSERT will receive and process the radio signal emitted by the orbiter part of the instrument and transmit a signal to the orbiter to be received by CONSERT.\nCONSERT will also be operated as bi-static RADAR during the descent of the lander Philae onto the comet's surface. From data measured during the descent, we aim at reconstructing a surface permittivity map of the comet at the landing site and along the path below the descent trajectory. This surface permittivity map will give information on the bulk material right below and around the landing site and the surface roughness in areas covered by the instrument along the descent.\nThe proposed method to estimate the surface permittivity distribution is based on a least-squares based inversion approach in frequency domain. The direct problem of simulating the wave-propagation between lander and orbiter at line-of-sight and the signal reflected on the comet's surface is modelled using a dielectric physical optics approximation.\nRestrictions on the measurement positions by the descent orbitography and limitations on the instrument dynamic range will be dealt with by application of a regularization technique where the surface permittivity distribution and the gradient with regard to the permittivity is projected in a domain defined by a viable model of the spatial material and roughness distribution. The least-squares optimization step of the reconstruction is performed in such domain on a reduced set of parameters yielding stable results.\nThe viability of the proposed method is demonstrated by reconstruction results based on simulated data.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the snow cover distribution is important to improve the assessment of water resource and prediction of snow related disasters. The predominant elements of snow cover in mountain area depend on the horizontal precipitation gradients on a regional scale. Improvement of the estimation accuracy of snow depth in mountain area is important to the reproducibility of orographic precipitation. We adopt the altitudinal dependency of snow depth (ADSD) as the estimation accuracy index of horizontal precipitation gradients. The aim of this study is to clarify the main factors causing regional difference of ADSD using high-density surface observational data and numerical experiments. Additionally, we perform sensitivity experiments to investigate the orography effect on the regional difference of ADSD. The sensitivity experiment was performed under the condition in which the altitude of the specific single mountain at an altitude about 1000 m A. S. L. was eliminated and treated as a plain area. The 4.5km and 1.5km numerical experiments were carried out using WRF Version 3.4. We executed the simulation focusing on heavy snow winter seasons and light snow winter season. We mainly analyzed in 2005/2006 heavy snow winter season in coastal area of the Japan Sea.\nAs the results, ADSD shows a high gradient and low variation in the windward area. Inversely, it shows low gradient and high variation in the leeward area (Figure a). The regional difference of ADSD in 1.5km experiments reproduces better than 4.5 km experiment (Figure b and c). These results indicate that the regional difference of ADSD is influenced by orography. Hence, we performed a sensitivity experiment to clarify the impact of orography on regional difference of ADSD. There are no apparent the regional differences of ADSD between windward and leeward area in the sensitivity experiments. These results indicate that ADSD differs between the windward and leeward areas because ADSD is primarily controlled by the spatial distribution of snow depth and snowfall affected by orographic precipitation. ADSD is complex in the mountainous areas. In particular, the spatial variation of ADSD is reinforced in the leeward area. These results suggest a need for high resolution experiments when assessing snow cover and snowfall in complex mountain areas.",

            "abstract": "The geochemistry of skeletal aragonite deposited by massive tropical corals preserves a valuable record of past climate. In particular, coral skeletal Sr/Ca records sea surface temperature (SST) at the time of deposition and is a widely used palaeothermometer. However, SSTs estimated from many fossil corals are significantly cooler than those predicted from other proxies and climate models. Accurately interpreting the SST records encoded in coral aragonite requires a greater understanding of the controls on skeletal Sr/Ca, including the effect of variations in seawater pH. We have developed an aquarium system to culture corals over a range of pCO2 scenarios that range from the last glacial maximum (180 ppm) to levels projected by the end of this century (750 ppm). We acclimated heads of massive Porites corals, the coral genus most commonly used in palaeoenvironmental studies, to four pCO2 scenarios over a period of > 6 months. Using SIMS we are measuring the Sr/Ca of the aragonite deposited over a five-week experimental period, following this long acclimation, at a 1-2 day resolution. We explore the relationship between seawater pH and skeletal Sr/Ca, and we investigate how skeletal Sr/Ca varies between fast- and slow-growing axes within the same coral, and between different genotypes within the same treatment. We have quantified net photosynthesis, respiration and calcification rates in each coral head throughout the experimental period, and we observe that calcification in the light is significantly reduced at a pCO2 of 750 ppm compared to 180 ppm (0.94 ± 0.17 and 0.45 ± 0.23 µmol CaCO3 cm-2 hr-1, respectively; p < 0.01). We investigate whether these differences influence skeletal geochemistry within our controlled culture conditions. Understanding the effect of changes in seawater pH, metabolic and calcification rates on the Sr/Ca of coral skeletons will significantly advance the application of this proxy in past climate reconstruction.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are a destructive volcanic hazard. Quantifying the types, frequency and magnitudes of PDC events in the geological record is essential for effective risk management. However small-medium volume valley-confined PDC deposits have low preservation potential, especially when emplaced in active drainages or onto snow or ice. Where PDC deposits are preserved they can be difficult to distinguish from other surficial deposits and are frequently misinterpreted or overlooked. This is the case at Mt. Ruapehu; a much visited, high-risk active volcano in New Zealand with no historical PDCs. Through systematic field observations we identified several young proximal-medial andesitic PDC deposits exposed on Ruapehu’s eastern flanks. The oldest deposits (Ohinewairua PDCs, <13.6 ka) are massive pumice-rich deposits that are preserved at least 7km from source (North Crater) and correlate with Ruapehu’s largest plinian eruptions. Overlying these, the pumice-rich Pourahu PDC deposit reaches >10km from source (South Crater) and correlates with Ruapehu’s last known plinian eruption (~11.6 ka). Several younger locally preserved PDC deposits (Tukino PDCs) with denser juvenile clasts represent proximal PDCs from smaller eruptions at South Crater. Finally, a variably welded, bedded deposit containing clasts of welded spatter is interpreted to represent multiple failures of near-vent (North Ruapehu) accumulations of erupted material. Here, PDC initiation appears to have been controlled by the topographic gradient and deposition rate, without requiring a collapsing eruption column. The Ruapehu deposits highlight the limited preservation of PDC deposits, which appears to be favoured at PDC margins. Lateral and vertical flow stratification means the resulting deposits may not then represent the bulk flow. Additionally, deposit textures, distributions, and associations with moraines indicate that many of Ruapehu's PDCs encountered glacial ice during transport. This affected their distribution, mobility and preservation, and has implications for assessing the PDC hazard at Ruapehu and other glaciated volcanoes. The deposits reinforce that hazardous PDCs threatening life and infrastructure may be generated even from small eruptions and across a wide range of eruption styles.",

            "abstract": "Cruise ANT-29/8 (SWEAP) of RV Polarstern in November 2013 headed for the Oblique Supersegment of the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) in the “Furious Fifties” to recover 10 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) after recording earthquake activity for a period of one year. The OBS recovery was flanked by a multidisciplinary science program that searched in difficult sea conditions for signs of hydrothermal venting, examined deep-sea fauna and determined the thermal regime of this rift section.\nThe seismic activity that accompanies crustal generation at ultraslow spreading mid-ocean ridges is hardly known. We present here preliminary results from the first-ever long-term deployment of OBS networks at two locations of the SWIR. We instrumented the segment 8 volcano near 65°E with 8 OBS and the amagmatically spreading Oblique Supersegment with 10 OBS, two of which returned no data. The networks had dimensions of 60 km x 40 km and a comparable station spacing of about 15 km. A first data analysis suggests that the seismic activity of the magmatic segment is about 4 times as high as that of the magmatically starved Oblique Supersegment. Interestingly, the segment 8 volcano itself displays a prominent seismic gap with a complete absence even of small earthquakes while the adjacent rift valley hosts earthquakes down to 15 km depth indicating a cold lithosphere. This spatial earthquake distribution may reflect an up-doming lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary that has been postulated to guide melts towards the widely spaced volcanoes of ultraslow spreading ridges.",

            "abstract": "It has been believed that water is carried into the deep Earth’s interior by hydrous minerals such as the dense hydrous magnesium silicates (DHMSs) in the descending cold plate. Recently, the new high pressure phase of DHMSs is theoretically predicted (Tsuchiya 2013) and experimentally confirmed in lower mantle pressure conditions above ~45 GPa (Nishi et al. 2014). This phase has MgSiO4H2 chemical composition and named as phase H.\nAt the lower mantle pressure conditions, Al and H-bearing SiO2, δ-AlOOH, ε-FeOOH and phase H may be the potential hydrous phases in the subducting slabs. Interestingly, the crystal structure of these hydrous phases are almost same and have CaCl2 type structure. This suggests that these hydrous phases may be able to make the wide range of solid solution. Some experimental studies already reported that Al preferentially partitioned into phase H and the stability of phase H drastically increased by incorporation of Al (Nishi et al. 2014, Ohira et al. 2014). The density of subducted MORB is reported to be denser than that of pyrolite in the lower mantle. Therefore, there is a possibility that phase H containing Al and Fe in subducted MORB survive down to the bottom of lower mantle and the melting of phase H at the core mantle boundary may contribute to the cause of ultra-low velocity zones.\nIn this study, we report the effects of Al and Fe on the stability of phase H, elasticity and seismic anisotropy of this new hydrous mineral using first principles calculation techniques and discuss the possible effects of this hydrous phase at the bottom of lower mantle.",

A project funded by the National Science Foundation titled K-12 Students, Teachers, Parents, Administrators and Higher Education Faculty: Partners Helping Rural Disadvantaged Students Stay on the Pathway to a Geoscience Career involving Wright State University and the Ripley, Lewis, Union, Huntington k-12 school district in Appalachian Ohio took led to dozens of seventh and eighth grade students traveling to Sandy Hook, New Jersey for a one week field experience to study oceanography with staff of the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium. Teachers, parent chaperones, administrators and university faculty accompanied the students in the field. Teachers worked alongside their students in targeted professional development during the weeklong field experience. During the two academic years of the project, both middle school and high school teachers received professional development in Earth system science so that all students, not just those that were on the summer field experience could receive enhanced science learning. All ninth grade high school students were given the opportunity to take a high school/college dual credit Earth system science course. Community outreach provided widespread knowledge of the project and interest among parents to have their children participate. In addition, ninth grade students raised money themselves to fund a trip to the International Field Studies Forfar Field Station on Andros Island, Bahamas to study a tropical aquatic system. Students who before this project had never traveled outside of Ohio are currently discussing ways that they can continue on the pathway to a geoscience career by applying for internships for the summer between their junior and senior years. These are positive steps towards taking charge of their own learning and shows promise of raising parents, teachers, administrators and other k-12 students awareness of educational opportunities in the geosciences, confidence in the ability of underserved rural students to reach their educational goals and supporting them through the critical middle and high school years towards a geoscience career.",

            "abstract": "In inverse problems, investigating the relationship between data and prior models and the uncertainty related to the posterior distribution of model parameters are as important as matching the data. In recent years, many efforts have been done to assess the posterior distribution of a given problem with reasonable computational costs through inversion techniques such as McMC. The derived posterior distribution is always dependent on the prior distribution. However, most of the studies ignore modeling the prior with realistic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a workflow to assess the uncertainty of inversion of hydraulic heads data through the addition of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) constraining data. The workflow is divided in three successive steps:\nConstruction of prior: we generate multiple alternative geological scenarios from literature data (architecture of facies) as well as site specific data (proportions of facies). Spatial uncertainty within each scenario is integrated hierarchically through geostatistics (multiple-point statistics simulation of facies constrained by ERT data as soft data).\nValidation of prior scenarios: we transform prior facies scenarios into resistivity distribution scenarios through forward and inverse modeling. The scenarios are validated by comparison with field ERT data. The comparison is made through distance calculation and projection into a low dimensional space to calculate the probability of each scenario given field ERT data.\nMatching dynamical data: we use the probability perturbation method, within each scenario, to integrate hydraulic heads to our models. We account for scenario probabilities, calculated in 2, in determining how many models per scenario we have to consider for building a reliable posterior distribution.\nAs an illustration, the method is applied on a field case study in an alluvial aquifer (Belgium) where we consider prior uncertainty related to the type of elements (gravel channels or bars) and to their size. This study shows the importance of considering the uncertainty of the prior in inverse problems as it has a strong influence on model predictions and decision-making problems.",

            "abstract": "On-line cable type Ocean Bottom Seismograph (OBS) is expected to be useful for making Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) earlier. However, careful handling of these data is required because the installation environment of OBSs may be different from that of land stations. The stability of OBS data exposed to strong shaking is one of those problems. For instance, Yamamoto et al. (2004) pointed out that the attitude of one of Off-Kushiro OBS (JAMSTEC) was changed about 5 degree by strong ground motion during the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake of Mjma8.0. The inclination of OBS causes baseline offset change in acceleration waveform on the gravitational acceleration component. Furthermore, it is also expected that coupling of the OBS and the ocean floor becomes weak. Since the processing of the EEW is ongoing in real-time, it is difficult to detect abnormal data appropriately. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of unusual OBS data exposed to strong motion at the Off-Kushiro OBSs. First, we estimate the amount of acceleration offset caused by rotation of the cable. The acceleration offset by slight inclination of OBS increases with input acceleration. And it is found that the acceleration offsets is larger on the horizontal component (Y’, perpendicular to the cable line) than the other horizontal component (X’, along cable line). Second, we compare the difference between the S-wave H/V spectral ratio for strong ground motion and that for weak ground motion to investigate nonlinear response. We found that S-wave H/V ratio for strong motion at OBS has typical features of nonlinear response which is similar with land stations: the dominant peak shift of lower frequency and the attenuation at high frequency. Finally, we discuss the influence of these unusual OBS data on EEW magnitude. We conclude that acceleration offsets resulting from incline of OBS could cause overestimation of magnitude.\nAcknowledgment: Strong motion acceleration waveform data of Off-Kushiro OBS were obtained from Submarine Cable Data Center, JAMSTEC.",

            "abstract": "During the past decade, several magmatic intrusions and eruptions have occurred in the Red Sea region. The activity began in 2007 with an eruption on Jebel at Tair Island and it was the first volcanic event known to occur in the southern Red Sea in over a century. We used co-eruption InSAR data to constrain a tensile dislocation model, which suggests that the island’s stress field is both temporarily varying and isolated from the regional Red Sea stress regime. Later in 2009, a dike intrusion in Harrat Lunayyir (western Saudi Arabia) almost made it to the surface to start an eruption. Our InSAR observations document how the intrusion first ascended to shallow depths and then started activating graben-bounding normal faults. The progressive dike opening resulted in over a meter of crustal extension and extensive surface fracturing. During the post-diking period, the ground deformation continued, but was of an order of magnitude smaller than the displacements associated with the main event. More recently, two Surtseyan eruptions occurred in the Zubair archipelago (southern Red Sea) forming two new islands in 2011-12 and 2013. High-resolution optical imagery reveals that significant wind and coastal erosion rapidly changed both the size and the shape of the two new islands during the months following the end of the eruptions. Several TanDEM-X InSAR data sets show the co-eruption deformation that occurred on the neighboring islands, indicating that both eruptions were fed by two ~10 km long dikes with a thickness of ~1 m. All these volcanic events were fed by dike intrusions and were contemporaneously associated with significant seismic swarms. Our observations do not show evidence for shallow magma reservoirs at these locations and that the magma appears to have ascended directly from a significant depth.",

            "abstract": "Studies on Martian meteorites, as well as the analysis of data obtained during space missions, indicate the presence of basalts on the Martian surface. Analysis of their alteration features may provide insights into the climate evolution and its local variations. In this work we consider Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) as a tool to identify diagnostic alteration features on a basaltic surface.\nAFM is one of the most widely used tools for surface science and has already been introduced in space missions. Its advantages include, among others, low instrument weight and high resolution capability. It allows to observe objects in the nanoscale and analyze their topography and roughness. AFM can operate in ambient atmosphere and can be used for different, also non-conductive, materials. However, it has some significant limitations, e.g. it is not possible to determine the chemical composition directly. In order to assess the suitability of this method for analysis of basalt alteration it is necessary to complement AFM with other methods, in this case, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).\nBasalt samples from arid cold (Udokan, Siberia) and arid hot (Ogaden, Ethiopia) environments, two of the possible Martian end-member paleo-environments, have been studied. Interesting places in the samples were marked with a diamond stylus for easy identification with AFM and SEM. Mineralogical analysis based on backscattered electron spectra (BSE) was carried out in selected areas of the samples. Structures examined by AFM were assigned to specific mineral phases; it is possible to perceive details of structures that may result from weathering. The study of rocks exposed to contrasted climatic conditions (arid cold and arid hot) aims at determining effect of temperature on the formation of these features. With the used experimental approach, the same area in a given sample can be studied both by SEM and AFM. The structure of minerals identified in the BSE can be located and observed at higher resolution on AFM images, leading to interpretations at a scale that was not attainable before.",

            "abstract": "Cratonic flood basalt volcanism is the most puzzling phenomenon compared to all other types of intraplate volcanism. Cratons are thick and cold; the two parameters which suppress melting of either sublithospheric or lithospheric mantle in dry conditions. Fusible eclogites at hot plume geotherm start to melt in sublithospheric depth (~ 230 km), but geochemical arguments require that, in addition to eclogitic component, significant volume of flood basalts are from peridotitic mantle. Dry peridotitic mantle cannot be melted unless the lithospheric thickness reduced to about 60 km. That is why modern plume models incorporate lithospheric delamination and/or initially thinned lithosphere to explain cratonic flood basalts. However, if lithosphere remained thick, which was the case for the Siberian craton by the time of formation of its Devonian (Vilyui) and Permo-Triassic (Siberian) flood basalt provinces, then plume model is unable to explain the flood basalt volcanism. If mantle is wet, the peridotitic solidus lowered such as it can start to melt at sublithospheric depth (for example, 2 wt. % H2O-bearing peridotite starts to melt at ~320 km depth even at a normal mantle geotherm). In this presentation I will show that fluxing of mantle via the deep water cycle process may explain the Siberian craton flood basalts and many other continental flood basalts. According to the deep water cycle model, water is carried to the mantle transition zone by fast subducting slabs (may be in form of solid ice VII), then water is released from the slabs due to warming to the ambient mantle temperature, then localized hydration creates buoyant wet diapirs (or melt-bearing diapirs), the diapirs raise up to the sublithosheric depth were melt accumulates for the following tectonically triggered flood basalt eruptions.",

            "abstract": "The North American/Eurasian plate boundary in Iceland is structurally diverse with oblique rifts, volcanic fissure swarms, and transform zones. Lagarfljót is a lake located in the Tertiary flood basalts of East Iceland that range in age from ~7 to 3 Ma. The lake is approximately 50 km E of the actively spreading, NS-trending, Northern Rift Zone (NVZ), and occupies a northeast-trending depression in an area of strong NS lineaments. A flexure zone runs N-S across the southern part of the lake, and predates an angular unconformity in the regional lava pile. Exposures in cliffs along the lakeshore and stream cuts above unveil a series of dikes and faults that can be correlated with the lineaments, and indicate a complicated tectonic history. Fault zones are characterized by fault breccia, cataclasite and gouge with well-developed slickenlines and clear shear-sense indicators. Fault gouge in individual shear zones ranges from centimeters to meters in thickness. Cross cutting relationships define the relative ages of 2 families of structures, with both post-dating the flexure. The older generation of faults are NS-striking, dextral, strike-slip faults. These are cut by NE-striking, normal faults. The normal faults are almost exclusively located along or near the margins of large dikes or swarms of dikes ranging from 1 – 5 m wide. Displacements along individual normal faults range from centimeters up to 8 m. Some faults cut the lavas above the unconformity and locally rotated structures suggest that limited tilting of the lava pile occurred during faulting. These findings may be related to larger scale processes of propagation and relocation of the NVZ.",

            "abstract": "Riparian vegetation is a key factor of the morphological evolution of river. In Europe, riparian Salicaceae is declining following the loss of potential recruitment areas associated with river management. As an exception for lowland rivers, the Loire River (France) shows, in its middle reaches, an efficient sexual regeneration of Populus nigra and Salix alba on bare sediments deposited during flood events.\nIn the literature, the influence of hydrological patterns as a key factor of the seedlings survival is well documented. Some studies focused on seedlings ability to withstand flood constraints and detailed the effect of duration and intensity of floods but few studies characterized precisely the processes applied on seedlings. As a working hypothesis, we consider that three types of flood stresses can induce mortality of seedlings: (i) uprooting by drag applied on the seedlings without sediment erosion, (ii) erosion of the recruited areas and (iii) burying. The distinction of these three processes allows identifying the importance of survival factors due to a strong sediment dynamics (e.g. erosion height > root height) or to the anchorage and resprouting ability.\nThe main issues are: what are the governing processes (type and intensity) determining survival or death of seedlings and which factor (fluvial dynamics vs. own characteristics of seedlings) controls their survival?\nIn-situ measurements were performed on a forced alluvial bar (20.000 m2) to detail the bar dynamics (bathymetry, topography, scour/fill processes, grain size surveys, flow velocity) and to survey the associated recruitment. On 48 plots (1.410 m2) the density, height and species (P. nigra and S. alba) were surveyed the year of recruitment (after dry period) and the next year after flood period.\nWe highlight the following phases of processes during floods. The erosion of substrate dominates at the beginning of the rising limb. The erosion or uprooting processes depend of the balance between available bed shear stress and sediment size. Then the deposit occurs on the back of the bar before the peak discharge and protects them against uprooting by burying during the higher energy of flow. At the end of the falling limb, sediments are reworked, decreasing the burying height of seedlings and allowing possible uprooting (drag) or erosion of sediments.",

In this study, we analyzed radiolarian fossils for seven drilled sites of IODP Exp. 346 from the Japan, Yamato and Ulleung (JYU) basins in a marginal sea of the mid-latitude NW Pacific. Significant variations of the well-preserved fossil assemblage imply that the unique oceanic circulation changes in the basins through Mid-Miocene to Pleistocene might be controlled by global climatic changes and topographic changes with local/regional tectonics.\nWarm water radiolarians Dictyocoryne spp. and Tetrapyle spp. characterized in the Tsushima Current water occurred commonly since 1.7 Ma suggesting a beginning of the warm water inflow from the southern strait of the basins. It might be coincident with an opening of the Okinawa Trough in the East China Sea. On the other hand, during the Pliocene period, sporadic occurrence of the warm water species was recognized in southern part of the examined area. This implies that a minor influence of the warm water was present in the southern coastal area of the Yamato Basin.\nTypical deep dwelling species such as Cornutella profunda and Peripyramis circumtexta is absent in the present JYU basins, however they occurred frequently during Pliocene and Miocene. This suggests the deep-water exchange between the JYU basins and the North Pacific via the deeper strait, which might be present in the northern part of the sea. These deep-water radiolarians disappeared from the JYU basins at the early Pleistocene (~2.7 Ma to 1.7 Ma), which is almost coincident with the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation.",

            "abstract": "Two proxies derived from branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs)-, the methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT) and the cyclization ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT), are often used to reconstruct paleo mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH on the belief of their terrestrial origin. However, mounting evidence indicates the existence of autochthonous brGDGTs in marine environments，which may affect MAAT reconstruction and the use of other related paleoenvironmental proxies. Here we provide high resolution profiles of brGDGTs in a sedimentary core (MD05-2896/7) from the southern South China Sea, which include MBT and CBT indices as well as the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The BIT results varied systematically with glacial-interglacial cycles, with values distinctly lower (<0.1) during the interglacial periods (MIS 1 and MIS 5) than during the glacial periods (MIS 2, MIS, 3, MIS 4 and MIS 6). Also distinct is the MBT/CBT-derived temperature, which show lower values during the interglacial periods but higher values during the glacial periods. We hypothesize that the lower MBT/CBT-derived temperature during the interglacial periods reflects subsurface water column temperature registered by autochthonous brGDGTs produced in situ marine conditions, whereas the higher MBT/CBT derived-temperature during the glacial periods reflects terrestrial MAAT because of the overwhelming input of brGDGTs from land when sea level was low. Similarly, the CBT-derived pH appears to have been overprinted also by the sea water signal of the interglacials but affected mostly by precipitation during the glacial intervals, showing patterns similar to or as a positive response to the southern hemispheric climate oscillation due to teleconnection. Our study demonstrates the complexity of brGDGT occurrence in marine environments and suggests that the MBT/CBT proxy should not be directly employed for the reconstruction of terrestrial MAAT at marine settings when BIT value is lower than 0.1.",

            "abstract": "Mantle dynamics drives the rifting of the continents and consequent crustal processes shape the topography of the rifted margins. Surface processes modify the topography by eroding positive reliefs and sedimenting on the basins. This lateral displacement of masses implies a change in the loads during rifting, affecting the architecture of the resulting margins. Furthermore, thermal insulation due to sediments could potentially have an impact on the rheologies, which are proved to be one of the most influential parameters that control the deformation style at the continental margins. In order to understand the feedback between these processes we have developed a numerical geodynamic model based on MILAMIN. Our model consists of a 2D Lagrangian triangular mesh for which velocities, displacements, pressures and temperatures are calculated each time step. The model is visco-elastic and includes a free-surface stabilization algorithm, strain weakening and an erosion/sedimentation algorithm. Sediment loads and temperatures on the sediments are taken into account when solving velocities and temperatures for the whole model. Although surface processes are strongly three-dimensional, we have chosen to study a 2D section parallel to the extension as a first approach. Results show that where sedimentation occurs strain further localizes. This is due to the extra load of the sediments exerting a gravitational force over the topography. We also observed angular unconformities on the sediments due to the rotation of crustal blocks associated with normal faults. In order to illustrate the feedbacks between surface and inner processes we will show a series of models calculated with different rheologies and extension velocities, with and without erosion/sedimentation. We will then discuss to which extent thermal insulation due to sedimentation and increased stresses due to sediment loading affect the geometry and distribution of faulting, the rheology of the lower crust and consequently margin architecture.",

To understand the mechanism of such changes, we measured the electrical conductivity and viscosity of the lherzorite analogues during slow increases and decreases in temperature reproducing the mantle crossing its solidus.\nTwo types of samples, one was forsterite plus 20% diopside and the other was 50% forsterite, 40% enstatite and 10% diopside with addition of 0.5% spinel, were synthesized from Mg(OH)2, SiO2, CaCO3 and MgAl2O4 (spinel) powders with particle size of <50 nm. Samples were expected to exhibit different manners in initiation of partial melt and amount of melt during the temperature change. We continuously measured electrical conductivity of these samples at every temperature during gradual temperature change, which crosses the sample solidus (~1380℃ and 1230℃ for forsterite + diopside sample and spinel-added samples, respectively). Sample viscosity were also measured under constant loads of 0.5~50 MPa.\nThe electrical conductivity and viscosity at well below (>150℃) the sample solidus exhibited linear distributions in their Arrhenius plots indicating that a single mechanism controls for each transport property within the experimental temperature ranges. Such linear relationship especially in the electrical conductivity was no longer observed at higher temperature regime exhibiting its exponential increase until the temperature reached the sample solidus. Such dramatic change with changing temperature has not been detected for the sample viscosity. Monotonic increase of electrical conductivity in accordance with increasing melt fraction was observed above the sample solidus.",

MESSENGER is now obtaining magnetic profiles across large impact features at altitudes less than the horizontal scale of those features. We use data from this latest phase to investigate evidence for remanent crustal magnetization specifically associated with impact basins and large craters. The spatial resolution of magnetic field measurements for investigating crustal magnetization is approximately equal to the altitude of the observations. We focus on large impact features because their relative ages provide a powerful chronological tool for interpreting any associated magnetic signatures. We examine profiles across large impact basins such as Caloris, Shakespeare, Budh-Sobkou and Goethe. For example, coverage over Caloris during the last year of the mission will be largely at night and will comprise 18 profiles with altitudes between 125 and 200 km and 12 profiles with altitudes between 50 and 125 km over the northern part of the basin. We use large-scale magnetospheric models developed with MESSENGER data to remove contributions from the offset axial dipole, magnetopause, and magnetotail. The residual magnetic fields above 200 km are still dominated by poorly understood magnetospheric fields such as those from the cusp and from Birkeland currents. We empirically average, or exclude observations from these local times, in order to search for repeatable internal field signals. We use local basis functions such as equivalent source dipoles, applied with regularization tools, in order to map the altitude-normalized magnetic field from internal sources. These internal sources may comprise both crustal and core contributions, and we use the information from the along-track magnetic gradient in order to separate these contributions.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, Sao Paulo city had its largest water shortage in history. By the end of the first half of 2014, the Cantareira system of water reservoirs, which is responsible for supplying fresh water for about 9 million people in the city, dried to less than 10% of its active storage, leading to a critical situation and the need to pump water from its dead storage and allocate water from other smaller systems of reservoirs in order to meet the demand of the city and avoid a mandatory water rationing. Understanding and identifying the leading factors for such a water crisis is critical for the security of the city. Here, we investigate historical data of water levels and inflows into the Cantareira system and of the rainfall series over the contributing basin in order to estimate the contribution of climate factors to the variability of the water storage levels at the Cantareira system and shed some light on the main causes of the current water shortage. Preliminary results based on natural inflow data from 1930 to 2014 and water storage levels from 2004 through 2014 reveal that, about 60% of the low frequency (beyond seasonal cycle) variance in the storage level trends is explained by trends in the inflows. A remarkably monotonic decreasing trend of about 1.5% per month in the storage levels is observed since 2010 and is closely associated with a similar decreasing trend in the inflows into the system for the period. In fact, the annual average inflow for 2012 (25.6 m3/s) and 2013 (25.7 m3/s) was 65% of the long term average and still below the 2004-2012 average withdrawal to supply Sao Paulo (26.64 m3/s). By the end of the 2013 rainy season the system had accumulated 63% of its total capacity, but the persistence of low inflows and high temperatures during 2013 did not allowed any increase in the water levels. In 2014 austral summer the system experienced the worst hydrological drought since 1930 based on the available streamflow records. The average inflow for the 2014 rainy season (DJFM) is the lowest value (14.5 m3/s) ever recorded for the season, with an empirical exceedance probability of 98.8%. Analysis of meteorological droughts and climate teleconnections in the region as well as of opportunities and implications of inflow and rainfall forecasts for 2015 from different modeling sources for water management in Sao Paulo are also discussed along this work.",

            "abstract": "Intermittently Closed/Open Coastal Lakes/Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a form of wave-dominated, microtidal estuary that experience periodic closure in times of low river flow. ICOLL entrance morphodynamics are complex due to the interaction between wave, tidal and fluvial processes. Managers invest substantial funds to artificially open ICOLLs as they flood surrounding property and infrastructure, and have poor water quality. Existing studies examine broad scale processes but do not identify the main drivers of entrance condition. In this research, the changes in entrance geomorphology were surveyed before and after artificial entrance openings in three ICOLLs in Victoria, Australia. Changes in morphology were related to continuous measures of sediment volume, water level, tide and wave energy. A six-stage quantitative phase model of entrance geomorphology and hydrodynamics is presented to illustrate the spatio-temporal variability in ICOLL entrance morphodynamics. Phases include: breakout; channel expansion with rapid outflow; open with tidal exchange; initial berm rebuilding with tidal attenuation; partial berm recovery with rising water levels; closed with perched water levels. Entrance breakout initiates incision of a pilot channel to the ocean, whereby basin water levels then decline and channel expansion as the headcut migrates landwards. Peak outflow velocities of 5 m/s-3 were recorded and channel dimensions increased over 6 hrs to 3.5 m deep and 140 m wide. When tidal, a clear semi-diurnal signal is superimposed upon an otherwise stable water level. Deep-water wave energy was transferred 1.8 km upstream of the rivermouth with bores present in the basin. Berm rebuilding occurred by littoral drift and cross-shore transport once outflow ceased and microscale bedform features, particularly antidunes, contributed to sediment progradation. Phase duration is dependant on how high the estuary was perched above mean sea level, tidal prism extent, and onshore sediment supply. High offshore wave height and frequency, in addition to littoral drift magnitude, were main drivers of closure. This study presents a predictive model of entrance morphodynamics whereby managers can determine proximity to natural closure or opening, and as a result identify whether implementing an artificial opening is worthwhile.",

            "abstract": "Past climates provide an out-of-sample test of the climate models used for future climate projections. We evaluate palaeosimulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years before present) and Mid-Holocene (6000 years before present) from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), focusing on features that are also present in simulations of the response to raised CO2. Several features of the simulations are common to both past and future simulations, including the ratio of land-sea temperature contrast, high-latitude amplification of temperature changes, winter amplification of temperature responses to year-round forcing, precipitation scaling with temperature, and differential precipitation/temperature scaling over land and ocean. The mechanisms giving rise to these phenomena are similar in past and future climates. Comparison with palaeoclimatic reconstructions show these features are simulated realistically in the past, and presumably therefore in the future simulations. There are also parallels in the regional response to changes in forcing in the past and future simulations, including changes in monsoon strength and in mid-continental climates. Comparison with palaeo-reconstructions shows the models capture the sign of such changes correctly but predict the magnitude poorly, and thus future projections are also likely to underestimate the strength of regional responses. LGM climates have been used to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity, on the assumption that the model that best reproduces reconstructed LGM climates is likely to have the most realistic climate sensitivity. However, global biases in simulated LGM temperature are only weakly related to climate sensitivity. Furthermore, ocean temperature biases are globally low and land temperatures globally high compared with reconstructions. The current generation of climate models includes improvements in resolution, complexity and parameterizations and produce better simulations of modern climate but evaluations show there has been no improvement in the simulation of past climates. Since past forcing and climate changes are of comparable magnitude to those expected in the 21st century, this emphasizes the need to focus on further improving the simulation of regional climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Wave and tide dominated sandy beach ecosystems have a major effect on coastal carbon, nutrient, and trace element cycling. The coarse-grained sediments are characterized by a high permeability, which permits advective porewater transport. Due to the fast porewater flow in the sandy sediment, organic matter remineralization products (i.e. nutrients and trace metals) are only slightly enriched in the porewater and rapidly discharged to the coastal zone where they can potentially stimulate primary production.\nHere we present stable silicon isotope (δ30Si) data from groundwaters and porewaters from Spiekeroog Island, a barrier island in the southern North Sea, Germany. Groundwater was sampled in the freshwater lens down to 70 m depth in the center of the island. The beach porewaters were taken along a transect from the dune belt to the low water line at depths between 0.5 and 5.2 m. This transect represents the mixing zone of fresh and saline groundwater with seawater, whereby the terrestrial driven groundwater flow provides a potential source of terrestrially derived Si isotope compositions resulting in a modification of the marine-dominated porewater composition.\nThe groundwater is characterized by high Si concentrations of up to 750 µM and rather low δ30Si signatures between +0.6‰ and +1.2‰, which decrease with depth (and age) within the freshwater lens. The porewaters have much lower Si concentrations around 50-60 µM and higher and more variable δ30Si between +1.0‰ and +2.5‰. The lower δ30Si values are found closer to the dunes and at greater depths in the beach sediments. These signatures possibly reflect the outflow of the fresh groundwater to the coastal zone. The higher values represent the influence of seawater, which delivers water with a high δ30Si signature previously enriched by phytoplankton growth.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is fundamental to advancing our knowledge of energy and mass transport in the solar system, thus also rendering it crucial to space weather and its prediction. The advent of truly wide-angle heliospheric imaging has revolutionised the study of CMEs, by enabling their direct and continuous observation as they propagate from the Sun out to 1 AU and beyond. The recently initiated EU-funded FP7 Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and Technique Service (HELCATS) project combines European expertise in the field of heliospheric imaging, built up over the last decade in particular through lead involvement in NASA’s STEREO mission, with expertise in such areas as solar and coronal imaging as well as the interpretation of in-situ and radio diagnostic measurements of solar wind phenomena.\nThe goals of HELCATS include the cataloguing of CMEs observed in the heliosphere by the Heliospheric Imager (HI) instruments on the STEREO spacecraft, since their launch in late October 2006 to date, an interval that covers much of the historically weak solar cycle 24. Included in the catalogue will be estimates of the kinematic properties of the imaged CMEs, based on a variety of established, and some more speculative, modelling approaches (geometrical, forward, inverse, magneto-hydrodynamic); these kinematic properties will be verified through comparison with solar disc and coronal imaging observations, as well as through comparison with radio diagnostic and in-situ measurements made at multiple points throughout the heliosphere. We will provide an overview of the HELCATS project, and present initial results that will seek to illuminate the unusual nature of solar cycle 24.",

            "abstract": "The broad deformation zone of the Himalayan belt and Tibetan plateau is largely the product of continent-continent collision between India and Eurasia plates since the Early Eocene. Ophiolites exposed along the Yarlung Tsangpo Suture Zone (southern Tibet) demonstrate that a long-lasting intra-oceanic subduction zone must have played a significant role in accommodating closure of the >7500 km wide Neotethyan Ocean before continental collision. Their study can provide key constraints on the initial history of the Neotethyan subduction systems, and the following formation and emplacement of the ophiolite. Paleomagnetic analyses of the sheeted dykes complex of ophiolites have been successfully applied in the past to reconstruct the initial geometry of the spreading system associated to the ophiolite formation. Furthermore, oceanic detachment faults, structures widely occurring in modern magma-poor (slow-spreading) mid-ocean ridges, have been recently recognized also in ophiolites (i.e., Mirdita ophiolite of Albania), and (if present) their study may provide unique insights into the geodynamics and geometry of the associated spreading system. The YZSZ ophiolites form a 2500 km long belt mainly composed of dismembered ultramafic massifs locally covered by a crustal sequence and oceanic sediments, underlying a regionally continuous clastic Xigaze sedimentary basin interpreted as the Tibetan forearc. Our study focused along a ~250 km transect within the eastern sector of the YZSZ between the Sangsang and Xigatze ophiolite. Paleomagnetic, structural geological, and geochemical analyses evidenced the presence of fossil oceanic detachment faults that locally (Sangsang) exposed the lowermost units (mantle) directly at the seafloor. Based on this evidence, and the reconstructed rotation pattern of the region we propose a tectonic evolutionary model characterized by the interplay between magmatic crustal accretion and trench-parallel and trench-perpendicular tectonic extension, which resulted in thinning and dismemberment of the ophiolite.",

            "abstract": "In most ophiolites, the contact between the mantle peridotites and the gabbroic cumulates from the lower oceanic crust is underlined by a horizon of dunite ranging in thickness from a few meters to a few hundred meters. The genesis of this dunitic transition zone (DTZ) can be attributed to different processes that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. They include olivine accumulation from high-Mg melts, reaction melting between a mantle peridotite and a melt under-saturated with pyroxene, destabilization of pyroxenes by high temperature fluid-rock reaction in conditions of water saturation. To precise and quantify the nature of these reactions and to determine their relative contribution has a major impact on our understanding of basalt genesis and of the chemical budgets at oceanic spreading centers. To reach this objective, we densely sampled the DTZ across several sections in the different massifs of the Oman ophiolites. The chemical composition of the dunites (WR major element and REE concentrations, microprobe data) presents a dramatic but not random variability both along single cross sections and from one cross section to the others. As an example, REE concentrations are a useful tool to investigate the petrogenetic processes behind this organization: in this study we have developed a chemical protocol in order to determine precisely (below 1% RSD) their concentrations, even for very low values (down to 0.1 ng.g-1). REE concentrations in true dunites are intensely variables: 0.5<[La]<100 ng.g-1; 0.1<[Eu]<4 ng.g-1; 8<[Yb]<50 ng.g-1. These variations are not random, LREE (La/Sm) ratios inversely correlate with HREE (Gd/Yb) ratios, which is a characteristic of melt/rock interaction. The various chemical tracers (major, minor and trace elements) indicate that the deep levels of the DTZ record a complex interaction history between mantle peridotites and various kinds of melts + fluids that migrated, stagnated and crystallized at different levels of this horizon, consistent with the “reactive filter” hypothesis. The shallow levels of the DTZ, however, present chemical trends becoming more and more consistent with an origin by fractional crystallization and olivine accumulation from primitive basalts as the gabbroic cumulates are approached.",

The system has been developed using five existing model components: the high resolution regional climate model HIRHAM5, the regional ocean model HYCOM and the CICE model that describes sea ice dynamics, the PISM ice sheet model and the GIPL permafrost model. These models have been interactively coupled which enables us to perform experiments examining the relative importance of ocean and atmospheric forcing as well as internal dynamics, to explain the recent rapid decline of Arctic sea ice, recent changes in the Greenland ice sheet mass balance together with both land and sub-sea permafrost conditions. Analysis of the model results indicates the model can successfully reproduce the interannual and seasonal variability in sea ice extent, describe recent changes in the Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance as well as permafrost conditions around Greenland and possibly under the Arctic Ocean sea floor. This opens up the possibility of a range of process based experiments as well as simulations to project the future and study the past of Arctic sea ice that we plan to run using the EC-Earth GCM as boundary forcing.\nExamples, focusing on various coupling issues will be presented and the need for further refinements will be assessed by highlighting processes that appear to be essential to the interactions and hence possibly important at climate scales.",

            "abstract": "Within the wide approach of watershed management, the crucial role of floodplains in hydrological processes and runoff generation, in particular during flood events, is well known. The recent changes in land use and/or intense rainfall patterns associated to climate changes, however, add complexity to the analysis of the hydrologic response. This study investigates and displays evidences and effects of land use changes and climatic changes in a small floodplain area in the north east of Italy. As in other countries in Europe, over the past half-century, intense urban and agricultural land uses changed the drainage networks, causing serious hydraulic dysfunctions. In this work we focused the research on the network drainage density and storage capacity, considering that they are the main requirements for hydraulic infrastructures and that the storage of water is crucial for any water management strategy. The effects of the changes in the network parameters have been then further investigated using the Network Saturation Index (NSI) that quantifies how fast an area is saturated by a design rainfall and can give an idea of the delay of the watershed response respect to the rainfall peak. Over the past half-century, the study site witnessed a drastic reduction of the storage volume, resulting in shorter times for saturation especially for storm events having a shorter return period and for events that were less critical in the past. For our case study, climatic evidence shows that the rainfall regime is highly irregular, with intense events taking an increasing role in determining the total precipitation over the past half-century. Considering this climatic trend that cannot be controlled, our study suggests to carefully plan the changes in the drainage networks, as these changes might seriously constrain the functionality of the reclamation system, especially for rather frequent rainfall events not necessarily associated with extreme meteorological conditions or with the worst case scenarios.\nSofia, G., Prosdocimi, M., Dalla Fontana, G., Tarolli, P.

The role of microbial metabolic reactions in altering basaltic crust is not yet clear. This presentation will summarize what is currently known or speculated about rates of microbial activity in crust, focusing on the cycling of iron and oxygen, based on data from a few basalt-dominated sites that have been examined recently, including the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the Dorado Outcrop.

            "abstract": "Soil erosion in cultivated land is one of the main critical issue because of its significant economic consequences, especially whether it occurs in hilly and mountainous environments. Among the cultivated lands, vineyards deserve a particular attention. In fact, they not only represent one of the most important crop in terms of income and employment, but they also constitute the form of agricultural land use that causes the highest soil loss. In these cultivated lands, the construction of terraces is one of the most widely used system for soil and water conservation measures. However, while favoring agricultural activities, terraces may cause local instabilities as well, if they are not properly maintained. Terraced fields are also served by agricultural roads and the construction of these anthropogenic features can have deep effects on water flows and instabilities. In fact, the plane surface of roads can intercept the overland and the subsurface flow and can modify the natural flow directions expanding the drainage network.\nThe main objective of this work is to use high-resolution topography derived from lidar technology for a hydro-geomorphological analysis of terraced vineyards. We considered few case studies located in Italy. At first, the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII) is used to identify likely sections of terraces and agricultural roads subject to potential landsliding or erosion. Statistical thresholds of RPII are then defined to label the most critical areas. Afterwards, using the index and the defined thresholds, different scenarios of soil conservation measures are simulated, to establish the optimal solution for erosion reduction. The results prove the effectiveness of high-resolution topography in the analysis of surface erosion in terraced vineyards, when the surface water flow is the main factor triggering the instabilities. This preliminary analysis can help in scheduling a suitable planning to mitigate the consequences of the anthropogenic alterations induced by the terraces and agricultural roads.\nTarolli, P., Sofia, G., Calligaro, S., Prosdocimi, M., Preti, F., Dalla Fontana, G.

            "abstract": "We investigate the properties of a new type of nonlinear coherent structure, called electron vortex magnetic holes (EVMHs) discovered during 2-D full particle realistic mass ratio simulations of turbulence. These structures form via the interaction of magnetic depletions and the local electron population in the plasma. They are characterised by local depressions in the magnetic field strength with circular cross-sections. We use PIC and test particle simulations to show that the magnetic structure is maintained by a current carried by an electron vortex which is due to a population of electrons with pitch angles close to 90 degrees in trapped, or quasi-trapped, non-adiabatic orbits. We then compare these results to Cluster observations of electron-scale magnetic holes (MH) in the Earth's plasma sheet. MHs in the solar wind are often explained in terms of the mirror mode instability. Here, in the plasma sheet, we show MH events in mirror stable environments, with high electron perpendicular temperature anisotropy, which cannot be explained in terms of a standard mirror mode growth. We show that EVMHs may provide a theoretical explanation for a majority of the MHs observed in the plasma sheet at scales less than the proton thermal gyroradius.",

            "abstract": "On 1 April 2014, the Pisagua earthquake ruptured the northern portion of the north Chilean seismic gap that remained devoid of large seismic events in the previous 137 years. The W-phase inversion yields an almost purely double-couple solution consistent with Global CMT and the local slab geometry. This event was preceded by two weeks of intense foreshock activity and followed by a large Mw=7.7 aftershock. In this study, we estimate the detailed rupture process of the mainshock using ALTAR: an innovative Bayesian sampler that is now implemented to run on GPU and allows sampling of posterior PDFs for high-dimensional problems. Our observations include InSAR, high-rate GPS and Tsunami data. We include a full data covariance matrix to account for measurement uncertainties and prediction error. This covariance model enables a physical basis for the relative weighting between available datasets and provides more realistic estimates of uncertainty on the inferred parameters. Our results indicate a compact slip zone located down dip of the hypocenter. The absence of shallow rupture is mainly controlled by tsunami observations. In the same way, the 1995 Antofagasta and the 2001 Arequipa earthquakes did not involve any slip near the trench. Using land-based geodetic data, it is fundamentally difficult to know if shallow portions of the north Chilean subduction zone are seismogenic or not. Therefore, as for the 2011 Tohoku event, we cannot exclude the occurrence of a major event rupturing the southern portion of the seismic gap and driving slip at shallow depth.",

            "abstract": "Active continental margin like the Ryukyu arc-trench system poses high tsunami risk, which however remains poorly assessed due to the sparse historic records and geological studies. In order to better understand the tsunami risk in northern Taiwan of the southernmost Ryukyu active margin, borehole cores of the Jinshan Coastal Plain were investigated for the tsunami deposits of 1867 event and possibly its precursors.\nBased on facies characteristics, two decimeter-thick marine event sand beds are identified intercalated with the fluvial gravelly deposit that has been accumulated in a microtidal barred estuary over the past millennium. Distributed all over the coastal plain except the coastal sand spits, the fluvial deposit are predominantly sourced from the Pleistocene arc andesite, and thus commonly reddish in color due to the high iron content. The marine beds are rich in quartz sand and granule, whitish gray in color, and rounded to subangular in grain shape, indicating a sediment source from the coastal sand spits which receive longshore drift from the nearby rocky coasts dominated by the Oligocene and Miocene quartzose sandstone and mudstone. The facies succession of marine bed is characterized by erosion base, planar lamination, normal grading, soft-sediment deformation, and variations in magnetic susceptibility, Si, K, Ti, and Fe. The succession reflects the sedimentary processes from incoming wave erosion, rapid marine deposition, backflow reworking, and suspension fall-out.\nThe marine beds are traceable landward based on the facies characteristics and C14 dating over a distance up to two kilometers before thinning out and grading into carbonaceous mud. According to the C14 dating, the two marine beds are linked to the 1867 tsunami and an earlier event in the late 17th century. Based on their ages and distributions, the two event beds further suggest two marine incursions of similar extant in an approximate recurrence interval of ~170 yr.",

            "abstract": "The Neoproterozoic stratigraphic record of South China contains distributed volcanic ash beds, which can be dated and used to provide a backbone for Cryogenian and Ediacaran ‘age models’. When integrated with geochemical and paleontological data, both locally and from other regions, these successions inform our understanding of environmental and biological change from these intervals. At present the South China stratigraphy provides the dates that best approximate the termination of the Marinoan glaciation (ca. 635 Ma, U-Pb single zircon isotope dilution1) from a dated volcanic ash bed that occurs in the cap carbonate sequence (Doushantuo Formation) which directly overlies the Nantuo Tillite (Marinoan glaciation equivalent). A number of other ash beds have been documented in both the Nantuo Tillite and throughout the Datangpo Formation (pre-Marinoan non-glacial succession) and have been variably dated using U-Pb microbeam and multi-grain isotope dilution studies2-4. These published data sets have produced dates that have uncertainties on the order of 4 Myr but are built upon single-analyses data points, which have uncertainties on the order of 10 Myr or greater thereby limiting their utility for assessing temporal relationship with other dated section. We present new U-Pb single zircon isotope dilution geochronology data from a suite of samples from the Datangpo, Nantuo and Doushantuo Formations. New dates from the base of the Datangpo Formation confirm a ca. 660 Ma end to the Sturtian glacial epoch, which is represented by underlying glacial deposits. Additional dates from ash beds from the Datangpo Formation and the lower Nantuo Tillite will refine the duration of the Cryogenian non-glacial interlude and Marinoan glaciation as recorded in South China. Combined with published data from Namibia, Australia and Canada, these new data will permit the development of a more highly resolved age model for the Cryogenian, enabling estimation of duration and synchronicity of proxy records. They will also provide further tests and input data for numerical models that seek to simulate Cryogenian climate drivers and responses.\n1. D. Condon et al., (2005) Science308, 95; 2. C. M.

            "abstract": "Since the discovery of diamonds in kimberlite-type rocks more than a century ago, a number of theories regarding the processes involved in kimberlite emplacement have been put forward to explain the unique properties of kimberlite magmatism. Geological data suggests that pre-existing lithosphere weakness zones may control the spatial patterns of kimberlites, but this hypothesis has never been tested by geophysical methods. As the first step in our analysis of tectonic and lithosphere control of kimberlite-type magmatism, we perform a detailed global analysis of the spatial patterns of kimberlites, and present the first results. The analysis is based on the assumption that the kimberlite emplacement is a two-stage process, and the two stages are controlled by the crustal and lithospheric mantle rheologies, respectively. Stage 1 includes the first-order, lithosphere-scale process that initiate the rise of kimberlite melts through the lithospheric mantle, which forms the major pipe. Stage 2 (second-order process) begins when the major pipe splits into daughter sub-pipes (tree-like pattern) at crustal depths. We apply cluster analysis to the spatial distribution of all known kimberlite fields with the goal of establishing characteristic scales for the stage 1 and stage 2 processes. The results indicate that characteristic scales for the stage 2 are almost globally uniform and thus are almost independent of the structure and the mantle lithosphere. In contrast, the characteristic scales for stage 1 vary over very broad limits and are, apparently controlled, by the past structure of the lithosphere and a “vigor” of lithosphere-mantle interaction, which caused kimberlite emplacements.",

This might be important encouraging evidence but, by no means, can be a “helpful” additive to statistics of a rigid testing that determines reliability and efficiency of a farecast/prediction method.\nUsually, earthquake prediction is classified in respect to expectation time while overlooking term-less identification of earthquake prone areas, as well as spatial accuracy. The forecasts are often made for a “cell” or “seismic region” whose area is not linked to the size of target earthquakes.

            "abstract": "Rapid progress in experimental, micro-analytical and textural analysis at the crystal scale has produced an unprecedented record of magmatic processes. However an obstacle to further progress is the lack of understanding of how mass, energy and momentum flux associated with crystal-rich, open-system events produces identifiable outcomes. Hence developing a physically-based understanding of magmatic systems linking micro-scale petrological observations with a physical template operating at the macro-scale presents a so-called “Grand Challenge.”\nThe essence of this challenge is that magmatic systems have characteristic length and feedback scales between those accessible by classical continuum and discrete methods. It has become increasingly obvious that the old-school continuum methods have limited resolution and power of explanation for multiphase (real) magma dynamics. This is, in part, because in crystal-rich systems the deformation is non-affine, and so the concept of constitutive behavior is less applicable and likely not even relevant, especially if one is interested in the emergent character of micro-scale processes. One expression of this is the cottage industry of proposing viscosity laws for magmas, which serves as “blunt force” de facto corrections for what is intrinsically multiphase behavior. Even in more fluid-rich systems many of these laws are not suitable for use in the very transport theories they aim to support.\nThe alternative approach is the discrete method, where multiphase interactions are explicitly resolved. This is a daunting prospect given the numbers of crystals in magmas. But perhaps all crystals don’t need to be modeled. I will demonstrate how discrete methods can recover critical state behavior, resolve crystal migration, the onset of visco-elastic behavior such as melt-present shear bands which sets the large-scale mixing volumes, some of the general morpho-dynamics that underlies purported rheological models, and transient controls on the emergence and dissipation of distinct thermodynamic states. As simulations with 106 – 107 crystals are now possible both the local, micro-scale crystal processes as well as the larger scale processes controlled by particle-particle-fluid interactions, can be simultaneously resolved.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic and elemental investigations of peridotite xenoliths can be used to model the timing and degree of melt extraction in the mantle. However, the primary melt depletion signature preserved in these xenoliths can be overprinted by subsequent metasomatism and melt-rock interactions, which tend to obscure the degree of original melt depletion either through the crystallisation of secondary phases or through the pervasive addition of lithophile element-rich basalt or its derivatives.\nAnhydrous spinel lherzolite xenoliths from the volcanic Maar de Borée in the French Massif Central have textures that vary from equigranular to protogranular. There is clear evidence of melt infiltration of up to several modal per cent in an anastomosing network of veins and stringers. Bulk-rock major elements and compatible trace element concentrations suggest that the Borée peridotites are genetically related by differing degrees of melt extraction, but the influence of melt infiltration, clearly visible at the thin section scale, and likely comprising several modal percent of the rock, makes this melt depletion difficult to quantify accurately. Some incompatible trace element concentrations in clinopyroxenes are consistent with melt depletion, while elevated (La/Yb)Nratios in others are clearly indicative of cryptic metasomatism and suggest yet another style of metasomatism. Furthermore, infiltrated melt along grain boundaries and in interstitial pockets disturbs the incompatible element mass balance, further obscuring the true nature of the prior melt depletion event(s).\nQuantitative lithophile element mass balance calculations will allow the effects of melt infiltration to be determined and stripped away from bulk-rock xenolith compositions, permitting a more realistic appraisal of the original melt depletion event.",

            "abstract": "Partial carbonation of the uppermost oceanic lithosphere represents a significant natural reservoir for long term carbon storage. About 25% of the oceanic basement formed at slow spreading ridges is made of tectonically exhumed and variably serpentinized abyssal peridotites in which carbonates veins have been documented. Previous studies indicate formation of these veins at temperatures between ~180°C and <10°C, at the seafloor or in shallow levels of the exhumation faults, and from fluids ranging from pure seawater to seawater-hydrothermal fluids mixtures. In this presentation we show that partial carbonation of serpentinites dredged at and near the easternmost Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) similarly occurred in two settings: dolomite formed at temperatures ~50°C presumably in shallow fluid-rich domains of the exhumation fault(s), while aragonite formed at yet lower temperatures within a few meters of the seafloor. We also present a detailed petrographic study of carbonation textures showing that while carbonate veining is prevalent in the seafloor-type carbonation, it is superseeded by serpentine dissolution and replacement in our samples of the fault zone-type carbonation. In these samples, dolomite preferably replaces the matrix of a tectonic breccia, that comprises angular clasts of serpentinite. TEM observations and diffraction patterns identify this matrix as microcrystalline to amorphous serpentine and document the contacts between this material and the dolomite. A comparison with textures reported for carbonated serpentine breccia from the Alps, and the Galicia margin suggests that prior tectonic brecciation enhances the potential for pervasive carbonation of serpentinites in the oceanic lithosphere at both mid-ocean ridges and the ocean-continent transition of divergent continental margins.",

            "abstract": "Structure I methane hydrate is the most common type found in nature. Structure I gas hydrate has two types of cages that gas molecules may be hosted. Because the larger cavities filled with ethane would be more stable than those filled by methane (Sloan and Koh, 2008), the larger cavities preferentially enclose ethane during the formation of gas hydrate, which results gas composition differentiation during gas hydrate formation.\nBased on the principle of gas composition differentiation, we establish a numerical model for the gas composition differentiation between methane and ethane during gas hydrate accumulation and applied the model to IODP site 1327. The simulation shows that the gas composition differentiation only occurs at the interval where gas hydrate presents. The lowest methane/ethane (C1/C2) point indicates the bottom of hydrate zone, and the composition differentiation produces the upward increase of C1/C2 within the gas hydrate zone. The C1/C2 reaches the largest value at the top occurrence of gas hydrate and keeps relative stable above the top occurrence of gas hydrate. The top and bottom occurrence of gas hydrate indicated by the inflection points of the C1/C2 profile are similar to those indicated by the negative anomalies of measured chloride concentrations (Riedel et al., 2006). By comparing with the measured C1/C2, the differentiation coefficient (kh=Xe,h/Xe,w, Xe,h is C1/C2 of the formed gas hydrate, Xe,w [mol/kg] is the concentration of ethane in water ) is calculated to 70 kg/mol. The top occurrence of gas hydrate indicated by the C1/C2 profile also confines the water flux to be 0.4kg/m2-year, similar to that confined by the chloride profile. To best fit the measured C1/C2 profile, the methane flux is calculated to 0.04mol/m2-year. Therefore, the C1/C2 profile could be used to obtain the gas hydrate accumulation information.\nAcknowledgments:This study was supported by Chinese National Science Foundation (grant 41303044, 91228206 )\n",

            "abstract": "The age of the Matuyama-Brunhes geomagnetic polarity transition (MBT) is a key datum for the Pleistocene time scale. Modern estimates of this age vary over a range approaching the 21 ka period of an orbital precession cycle. Singer (2014) placed the transition at 776 ±2 ka, in agreement with the estimate of 773.1 ±0.8 ka of Channell et al. (2010) based on an orbitally-tuned marine ice volume age model for North Atlantic sediment cores. The 40Ar/39Ar data of Singer (2014) are from basaltic lavas with transitional paleomagnetic directions and/or anomalously low paleointensities, representing episodic sampling of the geomagnetic field with limited stratigraphic context.\nNew data from Sulmona paleolake in central Italy (Sagnotti et al., 2014) reveals directional and relative paleointensity records with unsurpassed stratigraphic resolution of the MBT. Here, biogenic carbonates contain numerous sanidine-bearing tuffs derived from nearby volcanoes of the alkalic Roman volcanic province. These tuffs, dated in the LSCE and BGC labs, punctuate the stratigraphic record of the MBT, documenting a smoothly varying sediment accumulation rate of 20-25 cm/ka during the interval between 720-810 ka. A minimum age of 781.3 ±2.3 ka (nominal calibrations of Nomade et al., 2005 and Steiger and Jäger, 1977) for the MBT is provided by a tuff 1 m above the MBT. Linear interpolation between bracketing tuffs yields an age of 786.1 ±1.5 ka for the MBT, and indicate a duration <100 years for the reversal. The Sulmona record thus clearly provides the best opportunity yet known to calibrate the age of the MBT.\nApplying any combination of reasonable modern choices of decay constants and standard calibrations to our data yields ages between 781 and 793 ka for the MBT, raising questions about the validity of the ice volume model of Channell et al. (2010) unless the transition was globally diachronous (Leonhardt and Fabian, 2007) over a time interval of several ka. Regardless of which calibrating parameters are used, our 40Ar/39Ar age for the MBT at Sulmona is 15 ±3 ka older than that of Singer (2014). These results underscore the need for high-precision dating applied to geomagnetic polarity transitions that are based on high-resolution magnetostratigraphy, in order to calibrate the GPTS and validate age models based on orbital tuning.",

            "abstract": "A primarily analysis of marine geophysical data acquired aboard the RRS James Cook in the framework of the project \"Characterization of seismic hazard and tsunami associated with cortical contact structure Rivera Jalisco Block Plate (TSUJAL)\" is presented. This survey was held in the region of Nayarit-Tres Marias Islands between February and March 2014. The examination of data recorded by 16 OBS 's, deployed along 4 wide angle seismic profiles is presented, using an airgun-array seismic source of 6800 c.i., which allows sampling the crustal structure to the Moho. The profiles are located along the margin off the Marias Islands: a profile of over 200 km NNW-SSE direction and parallel to the western flank of the Islas Marias Islands and three orthogonal thereto. These perpendicular sections sample the lithosphere from the north of Maria Madre Island with a profile of 100 km length, across Maria Magdalena and Mari Cleofas Islands, with a profile of 50 km long, till south of Maria Cleofas with a profile of 100 km long. Coincident multichannel seismic profiles with refraction ones are also surveyed, although shooting with a source of 3,540 c. i., and acquired with a digital \"streamer\" of 6.0 km long. Simultaneously, multibeam, parametric and potential field data were recorded during seismic acquisition\nA first analysis shows an anomalously thickened crust in the western flank of the Marias Islands, as indicated by relatively short pre-critical distances of 30-35 km. While the moderate dip of 7 ° of the subduction of the Pacific oceanic plate favors somehow this effect, the existence of a remnant crustal fragment is also likely.\nMoreover, the images provided by the parametric sounding show abundant mass wasting deposits suggesting of recent active tectonics, possibly generated by earthquakes with moderate magnitude as those reported in the Marias Islands. This set of geophysical data, not only provide valuable information for the seismogenic characterization and associated hazard with Rivera-Plate/Jalisco block, but it will also contribute to decipher the complex interplay between the accretion of the East Pacific Rise, the Magdalena Crest and the opening of the Gulf of California in the northeastern part of the diffuse Middle America Trench.",

The high microbial diversity of microbial mats makes studies of microbial ecology notably difficult. To address this challenge, we have been using a combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, iTags and culture-based simplified microbial mats to study biogeochemical cycling (H2 production, N2 fixation, and fermentation) in microbial mats collected from Elkhorn Slough, Monterey Bay, California. Metatranscriptomes of microbial mats incubated over a diel cycle have revealed that a number of gene systems activate only during the day in Cyanobacteria, while the remaining appear to be constitutive. The dominant cyanobacterium in the mat (Microcoleus chthonoplastes) expresses several pathways for nitrogen scavenging undocumented in cultured strains, as well as the expression of two starch storage and utilization cycles. Community composition shifts in response to long term manipulations of mats were assessed using iTags. Changes in community diversity were observed as hydrogen fluxes increased in response to a lowering of sulfate concentrations. To produce simplified microbial mats, we have isolated members of 13 of the 15 top taxa from our iTag libraries into culture. Simplified microbial mats and simple co-cultures and consortia constructed from these isolates reproduce many of the natural patterns of biogeochemical cycling in the parent natural microbial mats, but against a background of far lower overall diversity, simplifying studies of changes in gene expression (over the short term), interactions between community members, and community composition changes (over the longer term), in response to environmental forcing.",

            "abstract": "In 2008, a large area with several hundred methane plumes was discovered along the West Spitsbergen continental margin at water depths between 150 and 400 m (Westbrook et al. 2009, GRL 36, doi:10.1029/2009GL039191). Many of the observed plumes were located at the boundary of gas hydrate stability (~400 m water depth). It was speculated that the methane escape at this depth was correlated with gas hydrate destabilization caused by recent increases in water temperatures recorded in this region. In a later study, geochemical analyses of authigenic carbonates and modeling of heat flow data combined with seasonal changes in water temperature demonstrated that the methane seeps were active already prior to industrial warming but that the gas hydrate system nevertheless reacts very sensitive to even seasonal temperature changes (Berndt et al. 2014, Science 343: 284-287). Here, we report about a methane seep site at the gas hydrate stability boundary (394 m water depth) that features unusual geochemical profiles indicative for non-steady state conditions. Sediment was recovered with a gravity corer (core length 210 cm) and samples were analyzed to study porewater geochemistry, methane concentration, authigenic carbonates, and microbial activity. Porewater profiles revealed two zones of sulfate-methane transition at 50 and 200 cm sediment depth. The twin zones were confirmed by a double peaking in sulfide, total alkalinity, anaerobic oxidation of methane, and sulfate reduction. δ18O values sharply increased from around -2.8 ‰ between 0 and 126 cm to -1.2 ‰ below 126 cm sediment depth. While U/Th isotope measurements of authigenic seep carbonates that were collected from different depths of the core illustrated that methane seepage must be occurring at this site since at least 3000 years, the biogeochemical profiles suggest that methane flux must have been altered recently. By applying a multi-phase reaction-transport model using known initial parameters from the study site (e.g. water depth, temperature profile, salinity, and sediment surface concentrations of CH4, SO4, DIC, and POC) were able to show that the observed twin sulfate-methane transition zones are an ephemeral phenomenon occurring during increase of methane production in the sediment, which can be introduced by, e.g., gas hydrate dissociation.",

            "abstract": "UAVs equipped with consumer cameras are increasingly being used to produce high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for a wide variety of geoscience applications. Image processing and DEM-generation is being facilitated by parallel increases in the use of software based on ‘structure from motion’ algorithms. However, recent work [1] has demonstrated that image networks from UAVs, for which camera pointing directions are generally near-parallel, are susceptible to producing systematic error in the resulting topographic surfaces (a vertical ‘doming’). This issue primarily reflects error in the camera lens distortion model, which is dominated by the radial K1 term. Common data processing scenarios, in which self-calibration is used to refine the camera model within the bundle adjustment, can inherently result in such systematic error via poor K1 estimates.\nIncorporating oblique imagery into such data sets can mitigate error by enabling more accurate calculation of camera parameters [1]. Here, using a combination of simulated image networks and real imagery collected from a fixed wing UAV, we explore the additional roles of external ground control and the precision of image measurements. We illustrate similarities and differences between a variety of structure from motion software, and underscore the importance of well distributed and suitably accurate control for projects where a demonstrated high accuracy is required.\n [1] James & Robson (2014) Earth Surf.

Based on the modern Argo observing system and artificial extension to the full depth, \"observations\" drawn from one CGCM are assimilated into the other. Our results show that the simultaneous atmospheric and oceanic constraints play a significant role for preventing the deep ocean drift.

More studies based on different assimilation models with improved spatial and temporal scales of the deep Argo array are demanding for further understanding the impact of deep Argo array.",

            "abstract": "Five years of oxygen isotope and hydrological survey reveal interannual variations in the inventory and distribution of river water over the Laptev Sea. Our results suggest that the Arctic Dipole Anomaly might connect the Laptev Sea river water inventory and the global Arctic freshwater inventory.\nIn 2007, 2009 and 2010 relatively low amount of river water (≤1500 km3) was found and was mostly located in the southeastern Laptev Sea. In 2008 and 2011, high amounts of river water (~1600 km3 and ~2000 km3) were found, especially in the central and northern part of the shelf, suggesting a northward export of this water. It has been suggested that atmospheric forcing mainly controls the Laptev Sea summer surface hydrography and for this period, the interannual variability or summer river water inventory is coherent with the summer Arctic Dipole index. This could suggest that the Arctic Dipole has been a dominant forcing controlling the distribution and the fate of river water discharged within the Laptev Sea over the 2007-2011 period, which is concurrent with the recently highlighted persistent shift in early summer Arctic atmospheric circulation (Overland et al., 2012, GRL 39, L19804). The variation in river water inventory over the Laptev Sea Shelf is also positively related with recent Arctic Basin and Beaufort Gyre freshwater inventory (with a 2-yrs lag), which suggest that the river water originating from the Laptev Sea have an impact on the global Arctic freshwater inventory.\nDuring the same period the brine inventory was also variable but was dissociated from the river water inventory variation suggesting that, during this period different forcing was influencing the brine inventory.",

            "abstract": "Recent detailed bedrock mapping in south-central Maine in the vicinity of the regionally extensive Norumbega fault system has revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized zone of overprinting ductile and brittle deformation herein referred to as the Ray Corner high strain zone. The nearly one km wide zone trends approximately 045o and can be mapped continuously for a distance of over 20 kms. Like nearly all previously mapped high strain zones of the Norumbega fault system, the Ray Corner high strain zone is contained within a single lithotectonic belt (Casco Bay Group) and thus while recording a polyphase history of high strain displacement at different structural levels, it does not represent a terrain boundary at the present erosional surface.\nThe Ray Corner high strain zone is characterized by an older (likely Devonian) pervasive steeply dipping mylonitic foliation. Lineations, where observable, are sub-horizontal and a variety of kinematic indicators indicate dextral shear. Quartz microstructures are consistent with grain boundary migration and sub-grain rotation recrystallization processes, whereas feldspars are fractured. EBSD analysis of recrystallized quartz ribbons reveal strong CPO patterns in c-axis pole figures (both Y maxima and bipolar maxima between Y and Z) that are consistent with prism <a> + romb <a> slip. These finding are consistent with mylonitic deformation occurring at temperatures in the 400-500oC range.\nSuperimposed on these earlier mylonitic fabrics in zones several 10s of meters across are a wide range of lower temperature brittle deformational features. These include spectacular pseudotachylyte fault and injection veins up to 3 cm thick, cataclastite breccia cored brittle faults up to 10 cm thick, and silicified fault breccia zones up to several meters across. While most of these brittle features cross-cut the earlier ductile fabrics, locally there is microstructural evidence of deformed pseudotachylyte layers within the mylonites suggesting a time of overlap between brittle and ductile deformational processes during the evolution of the Ray Corner high strain zone. Detailed studies of these relationships are in progress and should reveal information on what appears to be a polyphase history of displacement that occurred at different ambient conditions.  ",

            "abstract": "Passive mineral carbonation of chrysotile mining and milling waste was discovered at the Black Lake mine, southern Québec, 10 years ago. Indurated crusts were found at the surface and within waste piles where mineral and rock fragments are cemented by hydrated magnesium carbonates. A long-term research program has yielded significant insight into the process of CO2 capture from the atmosphere, and how it can be implemented during mining operations.\nLaboratory experiments show that the waste mineralogy is crucial, brucite being more reactive than serpentine. Partial water saturation, circa 40%, is also critical to dissolve magnesium from minerals, and transport aqueous CO2 to precipitation sites. Grain armoring by iron oxidation induced by dissolved oxygen prevents further reaction.\nTwo experimental cells constructed with milling waste and fitted with various monitoring probes (T, H2O content, leachate) and gas sampling ports, have been monitored for more than 3 years, along with environmental conditions. The interstitial gas in the cells remains depleted in CO2 indicating continuous capture of ambient atmospheric CO2 at rates faster than advection to reaction sites.\nThe energy released by the exothermic mineral carbonation reactions has been observed both in laboratory experiments (up to 4 °C) and in the field. Warm air, depleted to 10 ppmv CO2, vents at the surface of the waste piles, indicating reaction with atmospheric CO2 deep inside the piles. A thermal anomaly, detected by airborne infrared and coincident with a known venting area, was selected for locating a 100 m deep borehole fitted with sensor arrays to monitor active mineral carbonation within the pile. The borehole has intersected areas where mineral carbonation has indurated the milling waste. The borehole will be monitored for the next 3 years to better understand the mineral carbonation process, and its potential to yield recoverable geothermal energy in mining environments.",

In more than one instance, double-peaked FUV spectra probing plasma at transition region temperatures show evidence of oppositely directed (Doppler) outflows exceeding +/- 100 km/s. Raster Doppler maps using a Si IV transition region line shows all four jets to have helical motion of the same sense. Time-dependent data-driven simulations are used to investigate the underlying drivers for the jets.

            "abstract": "The Andes-Altiplano orogenic system, one of the most significant topographic feature on Earth, is the case example of subduction-type mountain belts. This latter conceptual model considers that the overall structure of the mountain belt forms antithetic to the subduction zone which marks the main plate interface, and as such poses several mechanical issues. Recent studies challenged this view, by proposing a model of the Andes involving an embryonic west-vergent intracontinental subduction, synthetic to the subduction zone and thus geometrically comparable to alpine-type collision belts. Here, we compare these two models of the Andes, by re-evaluating a cross-section of the range at the latitude of Santiago del Chile (33.5 °S). A particular structure, the east-vergent Aconcagua fold-and-thrust belt (AFTB), appears critical in discussing and discriminating between these two views. We revise the structural geometry of the AFTB based on satellite imagery, digital elevation models, existing geological maps and field observations. We propose a new 3D cartography and cross-section of the AFTB and conclude that the AFTB develops over a 2-3 km deep décollement, with a finite shortening of ~13 km. We integrate the AFTB to the well-documented fold and thrust belt forming the western flank of the belt and find that it is a relatively secondary feature of the Andes. From kinematic modelling using Move software (Midland Valley Ltd), we build a crustal-scale evolutionary model showing the progressive shortening of the Andean margin. We find that the AFTB can be modelled as a secondary east-verging structure, passively transported westward atop a basement ramp anticline forming the Frontal Cordillera. This evolutionary model is discussed and constrained in perspective of available thermochronology data. Our model therefore suggests that the Andes orogen can be mechanically modelled as an alpine-type collision belt, challenging our long-standing view of subduction-type mountain-belts.",

Such integrated data products and services can be used to study interdisciplinary issues by investigators representing various disciplines. In addition to the scientific benefits that can be attained by integrating remote sensing data with socioeconomic data, the integration of these data also present challenges that reflect the complex issues that arise when sharing and integrating different types of science data. When integrating one or more datasets that contain sensitive information, data producers need to be aware of the limitations that have been placed upon the data to protect private property, species or other inhabitants that reside on the property, or restricted information about a particular location. Similarly, confidentiality and privacy issues are a concern for data that have been collected about individual humans and families who have volunteered to serve as human research subjects or whose personal information may have been collected without their knowledge. In addition, intellectual property rights that are associated with a particular dataset may prevent integration with other data or pose constraints on the use of the resulting data products or services.

            "abstract": "Tsunamis caused by submarine mass failures constitute a widely recognized source of natural hazard. However, in the NE Atlantic the tsunami hazard posed by landslides remains poorly studied.\nIn this study, we attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the tsunami hazard of landslides origin. We investigate the tsunami hazard posed by deepwater submarine landslide failures in the Gorringe Bank (GB) area, NE Atlantic. This investigation requires detailed marine geological data and a robust numerical model to simulate both the mass failure flow and the subsequent tsunami.\nThe analysis of both swath-bathymetric data and the multichannel seismic profiles revealed evidences of the presence of at least three large deepwater mass failures in the GB area of possible tsunamigenic potential. It also allows defining the geomorphologic characteristics of the identified submarine landslides, which include the erosional area (dimensions, scarps) and the depositional area (sediments extent, volume). Some depositional volumes reach ~80km3.\nTo simulate the flow of the mudslide failure and the wave induced by the seafloor motion we employ a multi-layers viscous shallow-water (VSW) model. The lower layer represents the slide assumed to be a viscous-incompressible fluid, and characterized by sediments density, and kinematic viscosity. It is bounded by the upper layer consisting of seawater assumed to be inviscid and incompressible. We solve the VSW equations in a finite-difference scheme considering a “two-way” coupling approach.\nThe results are presented in terms of: i) evidences of submarine mass failures in the area of GB; ii) simulations of seafloor motion due to the occurrence slides failures; ii) simulations of tsunami generation induced by the submarine landslide flow; and iii) simulations of tsunami propagation and coastal impact. Results show that, using the VSW model, we are able to reliably reproduce the sediment deposit induced by slide failures. In some cases, the resulting initial tsunami wave reaches ~10m. We find that deepwater mudslides in the GB area have a significant potential of tsunami generation in the NE Atlantic region with a possible impact along the near-coasts.\nThis work is supported by the FCT project CONDRIBER, Ref.

            "abstract": "Plasticity/Fracture and rock failure are essential ingredients in geodynamic models as terrestrial rocks do not possess an infinite yield strength. Numerous physical mechanisms have been proposed to limit the strength of rocks, including low temperature plasticity and brittle fracture. While ductile and creep behavior of rocks at depth is largely accepted, the constitutive relations associated with brittle failure, or shear localisation, are more controversial. Nevertheless, there are really only a few macroscopic constitutive laws for visco-plasticity that are regularly used in geodynamics models. Independent of derivation, all of these can be cast as simple effective viscosities which act as stress limiters with different choices for yield surfaces; the most common being a von Mises (constant yield stress) or Drucker-Prager (pressure dependent yield-stress) criterion. The choice of plasticity model, however, can have significant consequences for the degree of non-linearity in a problem and the choice and efficiency of non-linear solvers.\nHere we describe a series of simplified 2 and 3-D model problems to elucidate several issues associated with obtaining accurate description and solution of visco-plastic problems. We demonstrate that\n1) Picard/Successive substitution schemes for solution of the non-linear problems can often stall at large values of the non-linear residual, thus producing spurious solutions\n2) Combined Picard/Newton schemes can be effective for a range of plasticity models, however, they can produce serious convergence problems for strongly pressure dependent plasticity models such as Drucker-Prager.\n3) Nevertheless, full Drucker-Prager may not be the plasticity model of choice for strong materials as the dynamic pressures produced in these layers can develop pathological behavior with Drucker-Prager, leading to stress strengthening rather than stress weakening behavior.\n4) In general, for any incompressible Stoke's problem, it is highly advisable to look at the predicted dynamic pressure fields, particularly if they are being fed back into the rheology.\nGiven a range of well described model problems, we discuss broader issues of what, if any, are appropriate plasticity models and under what circumstances we can expect to obtain accurate solutions from such formulations.",

            "abstract": "Insect outbreaks, wildfire, and drought have directly or indirectly impacted forest health, productivity and water use long before the advent of modern forestry practices. However, climate change may be acerbating these impacts are causing land managers to reconsider the use and timing of management tools. However, even as new methods are being devised to combat negative drought impacts, the forest response to chronic and increasingly severe episodic drought may be changing. Historically, the weakest (e.g., suppressed, understory) trees were the first to succumb to stress while the strongest (e.g., dominant, fast growing). However, recent studies have suggested that a combination of chronic and increasingly extreme episodic stress may be causing hereunto unobserved patterns in forest mortality with the more vigorously growing trees having higher rates of mortality than slower growing, more generally stressed individuals. I suggest that the forests have not altered their response to stress, but only that the level of stress, and the forest response to that stress has not previously been observed in recorded history. This extension of the forest stress response continuum has very significant implications to forest management under drought and associated disturbance. Therefore, this paper explores the causes and implications for maintaining forest resilience and sustainability under an increasingly variable climate.",

To understand why, we have to see how the atmosphere behaved over this period, and the atmosphere is a complex, non-linear system of many inter-related variables. Modern observing and weather forecasting systems provide a detailed and precise reconstruction of the atmospheric state, but to interpret and communicate the resulting mass of information we need to visualise it. This visualisation is a technical challenge in data handling and programming, and a design challenge in choosing projections, length-scales, colour schemes and variable sets to make video diagnostics that illustrate the important points.\n2013/14 is well observed, but to study climate change we need to compare it to much more uncertain reconstructions of similar events in previous years. By using fog as a visual metaphor for uncertainty we can flag uncertain areas in visualisations, illustrate the relationship between weather reconstructions and the raw observations they are based on, and target efforts to improve historical reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Although many continental rift basins and their successfully rifted counterparts at passive continental margins are magmatic, some are not. This dichotomy prompted end-member views of the mechanism driving continental rifting, deep-seated and mantle plume-driven for some, owing to shallow lithospheric stretching for others. In that regard, the East African Rift (EAR), the 3000 km-long divergent boundary between the Nubian and Somalian plates, provides a unique setting with the juxtaposition of the eastern, magma-rich, and western, magma-poor, branches on either sides of the 250-km thick Tanzanian craton. Here we implement high-resolution rheologically realistic 3D numerical model of plume-lithosphere interactions in extensional far-field settings to explain this contrasted behaviour in a unified framework starting from simple, symmetrical initial conditions with an isolated mantle plume rising beneath a craton in an east-west tensional far field stress. The upwelling mantle plume is deflected by the cratonic keel and preferentially channelled along one of its sides. This leads to the coeval development of a magma-rich branch above the plume head and a magma-poor one along the opposite side of the craton, the formation of a rotating microplate between the two rift branches, and the feeding of melt to both branches form a single mantle source. The model bears strong similarities with the evolution of the eastern and western branches of the central EAR and the geodetically observed rotation of the Victoria microplate. This result reconciles the passive (plume-activated) versus active (far-field tectonic stresses) rift models as our experiments shows both processes in action and demonstrate the possibility of developing both magmatic and amagmatic rifts in identical geotectonic environments.",

            "abstract": "The broad goal of this presentation is to demonstrate the utility of probabilistic generative models to capture investigators’ knowledge of geological processes and proxy data to draw statistical inferences about unobserved paleoclimatological events. We illustrate how this approach forces investigators to be explicit about their assumptions, and about how probability theory yields results that are a mathematical consequence of these assumptions and the data. We illustrate these ideas with the HMM-Match model that infers common times of sediment deposition in two records and the uncertainty in these inferences in the form of confidence bands. HMM-Match models the sedimentation processes that led to proxy data measured in marine sediment cores. This Bayesian model has three components:\n1) a generative probabilistic model that proceeds from the underlying geophysical and geochemical events, specifically the sedimentation events to the generation the proxy data\nSedimentation ---> Proxy Data\n; 2) a recursive algorithm that reverses the logic of the model to yield inference about the unobserved sedimentation events and the associated alignment of the records based on proxy data\nProxy Data ---> Sedimentation (Alignment)\n; 3) an expectation maximization algorithm for estimating two unknown parameters.\nWe applied HMM-Match to align 35 Late Pleistocene records to a global benthic d18Ostack and found that the mean width of 95% confidence intervals varies between 3-23 kyr depending on the resolution and noisiness of the core’s d18O signal. Confidence bands within individual cores also vary greatly, ranging from ~0 to >40 kyr. Results from this algorithm will allow researchers to examine the robustness of their conclusions with respect to alignment uncertainty. Figure 1 shows the confidence bands for one low resolution record.",

            "abstract": "Investigating the factors that influence magma flow dynamics within intrusions is important for understanding how magma migrates through the crust and erupts at the surface. Studying extinct volcanoes where erosion has exposed their plumbing systems provides insights into the final stages of magma movement. Fieldwork was conducted on the Isles of Mull and Skye, Western Scotland to study how magma flow is preserved within intrusions. On the Isle of Mull, 2-8m thick tholeiitic dolerite sills of the Loch Scridain Sill Complex (c.58Ma), crop out along the northern and southern coasts of the Ross of Mull, intruding into Paleogene lavas (c.60Ma) and Moine Supergroup Psammites respectively. Large columnar jointing is present perpendicular to the sill margins and is cross cut by arcuate fracture planes with parallel vesicle concentrations. Raised lineations were found on planar surfaces striking in similar directions to the arcuate fractures. These lineations have a range in strike from 148° to 172° and are inferred to be magma flow indicators. On the Isle of Skye, fieldwork was conducted in a disused quarry at Invertote where stacked olivine dolerite sills from the Little Minch Sill Complex (c.60Ma) intrude into Jurassic sediments. The sills are 0.5 to 8m thick, their contacts being defined by contrasts in jointing frequency, crystal layering, occurrence of gabbro lenses and variations in mineral proportion, size and composition. A series of five distinct sills crop out, with two N-S striking dikes cross-cutting the site. Pahoehoe ropes were found preserved on exposed contacts of one dike, which helped to infer the magma flow direction. Detailed sampling was carried out and petrographic thin sections analysed to describe the crystalline fabrics across the length and breadth of the intrusions. The results of the petrographic study are compared with magnetic fabrics from AMS and AARM analysis techniques to provide an independent quantification of flow trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) contamination in the subsurface increases with the rapid development of oil industry and becomes the focus of many studies. The migration, distribution and remediation efficiency of DNAPLs in the subsurface environment are greatly affected by the solution chemistry besides the physical heterogeneities of aquifers. Humic acid (HA), which is ubiquitous in natural environments, is a surface active substance exhibiting solubility enhancement behavior for hydrophobic organic compounds such as DNAPLs. Here we reported a laboratory investigation to study the effects of HA on the infiltration, immobilization and subsequent recovery of DNAPL in porous media.\nTetrachloroethylene (PCE) was selected as the representative DNAPL in this study. Two-dimensional (2-D) sandbox experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different HA concentrations on the transport, distribution of PCE and the remediation of PCE using surfactant (Tween 80) flushing in a saturated porous media system. The surfactant flushing of PCE was performed after the PCE transport and distribution had reached equilibrium. A light transmission visualization method with charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was adopted to visualize PCE distribution and quantify its saturation. In addition, the experiments were also designed to gather data for the validation of multiphase flow models. Effluent samples were collected to determine dissolved PCE concentrations. PCE solubilization and PCE-water interfacial tension were experimentally determined in aqueous solutions of varying HA concentrations. The experimental results showed that the presence of HA can have a dramatic impact on PCE flow and entrapment, and significantly improved the recovery of PCE during surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR). The findings are of use for better understanding of the migration and entrapment of DNAPLs and developing of SEAR technology.",

            "abstract": "Records of bedrock river incision are commonly used to infer rock uplift under the assumption that rates of these two processes match over the long term (>105 yrs). A recent compilation of 14 bedrock river incision records, however, illustrates a dependence of rate on measured interval on time scales approaching 107 yrs, a characteristic that we term the fluvial Sadler effect. The process(es) responsible for such a fluvial Sadler effect over long time scales is unknown, but it is argued to arise because hiatuses in fluvial incision follow a stochastic, heavy-tailed distribution. If correct, linking river incision and rock uplift becomes more complicated than previously thought. Motivated by pervasive evidence in support of non-stochastic, quasi-cyclic climate forcing as modulating rates of bedrock river incision, we explore the degree to which the fluvial Sadler effect may instead arise by such deterministic forcing. We demonstrate that river incision rate is inherently a time dependent measurement, because the reference frame from which it is calculated (the river profile) is dynamic and not fixed with respect to the geoid. Out of necessity, the modern river profile is often used to calculate river incision. Even when uplift is steady and uniform and incision is modulated by quasi-cyclic, deterministic forcing, the use of this static reference systematically biases calculations of river incision producing a dependence of rate on measured interval that is similar to expectations for a stochastic, heavy-tailed distribution. In such cases, the fluvial Sadler effect persists at all time scales, but is largely minimized at times greater than one period of the longest quasi-cyclic forcing. We conclude that bedrock river incision rate, when modulated by deterministic climatic forcing, provides a reliable proxy for rock uplift rate given integration across at least one glacial-interglacial cycle (>105 yrs) and consideration of the correct local base level datum.",

Some of the resulting mantle heterogeneities might have survived convective mixing and remained chemically distinctive, possibly residing today at the base of the lower mantle. To gain insights into the origin, composition and properties of these possible lower mantle heterogeneities, we are investigating melting phase relations on compositions in the binary MgO-SiO2 (MS) and ternary CaO-MgO-SiO2(CMS) systems at lower mantle pressures, using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) technique. An important objective of this study is to determine the effect of pressure on invariant melt compositions involving the following liquidus mineral assemblages, corresponding to peridotitic and basaltic model compositions:\n1. Mg-perovskite (mgpv) + periclase (pc) and mgpv + silica in the MS-system.\n2. Mgpv + pc + Ca-perovskite (capv) and mgpv + capv + silica in the CMS-system.\nTwo methodologies were developed in order to explore melting relations under high pressure conditions. Firstly, exploratory experiments were performed to investigate invariant melting temperatures (Tm) using postulated near-eutectic compositions. Secondly, in order to greatly reduce temperature gradients compared to conventional LH-DAC experiments, a novel technique for micro-fabrication of metal-encapsulated samples has been developed. The selected near-eutectic compositions show an expected positive P-Tm correlation, with lower Tm for the CMS-system. Our preliminary results indicate that the dTm/dP slope for the pv-silica eutectic is lower than for the pv-pc eutectic in the MS-system. Overall, there is good agreement between our results and the results of simulations based on density functional theory(1) and thermodynamic extrapolations of experimental data at lower pressures(2).\n",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes and their related tsunami impact submarine geological processes that can form specific submarine event deposits. Most of widely distributed event beds are typically fine-grained turbidites. Examples from the Nankai Trough and the Beppu Bay suggest that a terminal isolated depression is area with the highest potential for the deposition of fine-grained turbidites. The 2004 off the Kii Peninsula earthquakes caused a fine-grained turbidite deposited in a small basin on the Nankai accretionary prism slope, and formed a thick acoustically transparent layer. Off Sanriku thickness of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake and tsunami event beds was usually a few-several cm, but was highest in the Japan Trench with several tens cm. The Japan Trench floor is the deepest and terminal basin. The terminal basin is a potential area for marine paleoseismology. Preservation potential is a factor for usage of submarine event beds as paleoseimsological tool. Repeated sampling of surface sediments from off Sanriku after the 2011 event suggests that the preservation potential of fine-grained event bed is low in the strong benthos activity zone. Sedimentation rate is another factor on the preservation potential. Quick and high sediment accumulation after the event bed deposition diminishes the pressure for the destruction of the event beds by benthos activity. Thus, a small basin covered by the bottom water with low dissolved oxygen concentration, and occurred under the high primary productivity areas is a good example of basins with high preservation potential of event beds. High resolution seismic profiles in the central Japan Trench indicate that occurrence of the well-stratified strata filling the trench and subducting graben depressions. These strata have high potential for seismo-turbidite deposition. Thus, small basins on the mid-slope terrace and the trench floor of the central Japan Trench are most preferable and potential candidates for submarine paleoseismology.",

If no slip partitioning occurs, the slip vectors coincide with the plate convergence direction, whereas for full partitioning the azimuths of the vectors fall along the trench normal direction. Strain partitioning can have an influence on the deformation that remains after a complete cycle and on the seismotectonic segmentation of a margin. Before, during and after the Maule 2010 earthquake the forearc was densely monitored by seismological and geodetic networks allowing to investigate strain partitioning, its causes and its consequences on the stress regime during the inter-, co- and postseismic phases.\nWe examine azimuths from displacements from GPS stations and focal mechanisms along the Maule 2010 rupture. Since the focal mechanisms are related to the principal stress axes and the GPS stations measure the displacement on the surface, they provide independent constraint to quantify the variation in time of the strain partitioning. The azimuthal information from seismicity and GPS is used to characterize the phases of the seismic cycle along the Maule 2010 rupture zone by looking at data from the inter-, co- and postseismic phase. Results show that the mean azimuth direction of the postseismic and coseismic displacement differs approximately 10° with the postseismic displacement directions have a smaller trench parallel component. Larger aftershocks occur mostly offshore or close to the shoreline and show the tendency to point more to the plate convergence direction with increasing distance from the trench. During the postseismic phase, vectors rotate clockwise approaching the plate convergence direction, which may be an indicator of the relocking of the plate interface. Comparing the azimuths of GPS vectors for the interseismic and coseismic phase the data suggests a change in the partitioning behaviour of the incoming plate convergence vector for both, seismic phases and increasing distance to the trench. Similar observations in other subduction zones were previously interpreted as change in the partitioning behaviour. However, rotational effects, internal deformation of the forearc, heterogeneous coupling of the plate interface need to be considered.",

Microscopic observations and microprobe mapping show the presence of aragonite needles inside the coral pores. They are characterized by high Sr/Ca ratios of up to 14.7±0.3mmol/mol, shifting the corresponding SST to ~6.2±1.1°C. Inhomogeneous distribution of Sr/Ca reflects partial dissolution, pore fluid percolation and re-precipitation of Sr within the coral. The resulting effect of early diagenesis on the SST records is reflected by significant temperature offsets up to ±6°C. A relative SST reconstruction is still feasible by normalizing the records to their individual mean value. Latter approach shows that all three records are in phase with simultaneous SST variability of up to ±2.4°C with respect to the Holocene mean value. Low SSTs are observed between ~4.4 to ~4.9ka BP and ~2.8 to ~3.4ka BP. Relatively high temperatures are observed at ~5ka BP, between ~3.7 and 3.9ka BP as well as at ~1.8ka BP to ~2.6ka BP. This indicates SST oscillations with the periodicity of 1500yrs in the Society island record which is in general accord with the solar activity reconstructed from 10Be and 14C production (Vonmoos et al., 2006, JGR 111, A10105). In particular, the relatively high SST reconcile empirically determined sea level variations (Rashid et al., 2014, G3, 15) indicating a higher sea level than predicted from numerical modelling taking only “Glacial Isostatic Adjustment” into account as the primary controlling factor for the Late Holocene sea level variation.",

            "abstract": "Peridotite constitutes most of the Earth’s upper mantle, and it is therefore unsurprising that most mantle-derived magmas exhibit evidence of past equilibrium with olivine-dominated source. There is mounting evidence, however, for the role of pyroxenite in magma generation within upwelling mantle plumes; a less documented non-peridotite source of melts are metasomatic veins (metasomes) within the lithospheric mantle. Melts derived from metasomes may exhibit extreme enrichment or depletion in major and trace elements. We hypothesize that phenocrysts such as olivine, which are commonly used to probe basalt source lithology, will reflect these unusual geochemical signals. Here we present preliminary major and trace element analyses of 60 lavas erupted from a small Miocene shield volcano located within the Ethiopian flood basalt province. Erupted lavas are intercalated with lahars and pyroclastic horizons that are overlain by a later stage of activity manifested in small cinder cones and flows. The lavas form two distinctive petrographic and geochemical groups: (A) an olivine-phyric, low Ti group (1.7-2.7 wt. % TiO2; 4.0-13.6 wt. % MgO), which geochemically resembles most of the basalts in the region. These low Ti lavas are the only geochemical unit identified in the later cinder cones and associated lava flows. (B) a clinopyroxene-phyric high Ti group (1-6.7 wt. % TiO2; 1.0-9.5 wt. % MgO), which resembles the Oligocene HT-2 flood basalts. This unit is found intercalated with low Ti lavas within the Miocene shield. In comparison to the low Ti group, the high Ti lavas exhibit a profound depletion in Ni, Cr, Al, and Si, and significant enrichment in Ca, Fe, V, and the most incompatible trace elements. When combined with a diagnostic negative K anomaly in primitive-mantle normalized diagrams and Na2O>K2O, the geochemical data point towards a source which is rich in amphibole, devoid of olivine, and perhaps containing some carbonate. Our preliminary results have identified a large suite of primitive lavas derived from a nominally olivine-free mantle source. Consequently, our future work will examine olivine geochemical characteristics and constrain the compositional space for these unusual mantle lithologies.",

Previous numerical modeling results have indicated that advective accelerations are an important contribution to the alongshore force balance, and are required to understand spatial variations in alongshore currents (which may result in spatially variable morphological change). However, most prior observational studies have neglected advective accelerations in the alongshore force balance. Using a numerical model (Delft3D) to predict optimal sensor locations, a dense array of 26 colocated current meters and pressure sensors was deployed between the shoreline and 3-m water depth over a 200 by 115 m region near Duck, NC in fall 2013. The array included 7 cross- and 3 alongshore transects. Here, observational and numerical estimates of the dominant forcing terms in the alongshore balance (pressure and radiation-stress gradients) and the advective acceleration terms will be compared with each other. In addition, the numerical model will be used to examine the force balance, including sources of velocity gradients, at a higher spatial resolution than possible with the instrument array. Preliminary numerical results indicate that at O(10-100 m) alongshore scales, bathymetric variations and the ensuing alongshore variations in the wave field and subsequent forcing are the dominant sources of the modeled velocity gradients and advective accelerations. Additional simulations and analysis of the observations will be presented. Funded by NSF and ASDR&E.",

            "abstract": "One of the crucial aspects of climate policy in the near future is the design of mitigation strategies. However, we can only get information from state of the art climate models at a handful of mitigation scenarios (e.g. the SRES and RCP scenarios). In order to compare alternative strategies and their impacts using models, we need to consider the climate effects of the corresponding emission/concentration pathways for which we don’t have climate model output. Currently this is mainly done by pattern-scaling – multiplying the mean pattern of climate change by the change in the mean of the variable (e.g. temperature or precipitation) over time. A generalised alternative to pattern scaling is statistical emulation.\nA statistical emulator is a more sophisticated way of interpolating climates between a limited number of model runs. Although widely used in science for the modelling of computer experiments, the use of statistical emulators in climate science has been limited and mainly used for perturbed physics ensembles. However emulators are perfectly well suited for use with forcing conditions instead of (or as well as) model parameters. Pattern scaling is a special (very simple) case of an emulator.\nWe will show how by parameterising the forcing functions and building emulators we can predict the climate for any reasonable set of forcings (including overshoot scenarios and other ‘odd’ forcing pathways). We also set out how a ScenarioMIP type experiment would have to be configured to achieve this.",

            "abstract": "Identifying the form and nature of coastal landscape changes that may occur in response to future sea-level rise (SLR) is essential to support decision making for resource allocation that improves climate change resilience. Both natural ecosystems and the built environment are subject to these changes and require associated resilience assessments. Existing assessments of coastal change driven by SLR typically focus on two categories of coastal response: 1) inundation by flooding as the water level rises; and 2) dynamic change resulting from movement of landforms and/or ecosystems. Results from these assessments are not always straightforward to apply in a decision support context, as it can be unclear what the dominant response type may be in a given coastal setting (e.g., barrier island, headland, wetland, forest). Furthermore, an important decision support element is to capture and clearly convey the associated uncertainty of both the underlying datasets (e.g., elevation) and climate drivers (e.g., relative SLR).\nWe developed a Bayesian network model of SLR assessment that uses publicly available geospatial datasets—land cover, elevation, and vertical land movement—and their associated uncertainties to generate probabilistic predictions of those areas likely to inundate versus dynamically respond to various SLR scenarios. SLR projections were generated using multiple sources of information, including Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. Model outputs include predictions of potential future land-surface elevation and coastal response type at landscape (>100 km) to local (5-10 km) scales for the Northeastern U.S., commensurate with decision-making needs. The probabilistic approach allows us to objectively and transparently describe prediction certainty to decision makers. From this approach, we are also able to highlight areas in which more data or knowledge may be needed to provide a stronger basis for decision making.",

As the predominant long-lived sulfur-containing species in the troposphere it serves as main contributor to the stratospheric aerosol-layer and, thus, indirectly contributes to radiative cooling of the atmosphere. However, the relative contribution of OCS and SO2 to the Junge-layer is still in debate. Further, OCS can be used as proxy for the photosynthetic uptake of CO2 due to its similar diffusion pathways into leaves but – in contrast to CO2 - irreversible uptake. Thus, understanding of global OCS fluxes may contribute to assess gross primary productivity in the biosphere.\nIn this paper we will present observations of globally and temporally resolved distributions of OCS in the region of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over the period 2002-2012 by MIPAS/Envisat. In this dataset various features indicating sources and sinks can be observed for the first time: a region of low OCS concentrations over central S-America and Africa exhibiting an annual cycle, elevated values at the tropopause above the monsoon region and enhanced values in the upper troposphere above the maritime continent in spring. Further, the OCS dataset is correlated with biomass burning tracers from MIPAS, like HCN, to investigate the related emissions of OCS. To interpret the observations and constrain global and regional OCS fluxes, the MIPAS OCS distributions in the UTLS are compared to various simulations with the chemistry transport model EMAC on basis of different emission scenarios",

            "abstract": "The mechanics of deep earthquakes have remained a puzzle for researchers since 1928 when they were first accurately identified by Kiyoo Wadati1 in Japan. Deep earthquakes show a split distribution, with peaks centered around ~370-420km and ~520-550km. As these events are limited to subducting slabs, it is accepted that they may be due to phase changes in metastable slab material. Indeed, conditions at ~350km depth are nominally appropriate for the olivine – wadsleyite transition, consistent with the anticrack mechanism previously observed in (Mg,Fe)2SiO42. The additional peak around 520km suggests that there is another siesmogenic phase change; candidates include Ca-garnet -> Ca-perovskite, wadsleyite -> ringwoodite and enstatite -> majorite or ilmenite. Importantly, for large scale seismogenesis to occur candidate phase changes must be susceptible to a runaway mechanism. Typically this involves the release of heat during exothermic reactions, which acts to increase reaction and nucleation rates. It is worth noting that the post-spinel reaction (sp -> pv + fp) marks the cessation of deep earthquakes; possibly as a result of being endothermic.\nThis research aims to identify which of these candidates could be responsible for seismogenesis.\nWe use high-pressure split cylinder multi-anvil experiments with acoustic emission detection. Low-pressure analogue materials have been used to allow greater cell sizes and thus sample volumes to enable accurate location of AE to within the sample. The candidate phase is annealed below its phase boundary, and then taken through the boundary by further compression. Acoustic emissions, if generated, are observed in real time and later processed to ensure they emanate from within the sample volume. Initial results indicate that the pryroxene -> ilmenite transition in MgGeO3 is seismogenic, with several orders of magnitude increase in the energy of AE concurrent with the phase boundary.\n",

            "abstract": "Formation and evolution of the solar system is studied in part using stable isotope ratios that are presumed to be primordial, or representative of conditions in the protosolar Nebula. Comets, meteorites and giant planet atmospheres provide measurements that can reasonably be presumed to represent primordial conditions while the terrestrial planets, Pluto and Saturn’s moon Titan have atmospheres that have evolved over the history of the solar system. The stable isotope ratios measured in these atmospheres are, therefore, first a valuable tool for evaluating the history of atmospheric escape and once escape is constrained can provide indications of conditions of formation. D/H ratios in the atmosphere of Venus provide indications of the amount of water lost from Venus over the history of the solar system, while several isotope ratios in the atmosphere of Mars provide evidence for long-term erosion of the atmosphere. We have recently demonstrated that the nitrogen ratios, 14N/15N, in Titan’s atmosphere cannot evolve significantly over the history of the solar system and that the primordial ratio for Titan must have been similar to the value recently measured for NH3 in comets. This implies that the building blocks for Titan formed in the protosolar nebula rather than in the warmer subnebula surrounding Saturn at the end of its formation. Our result strongly contrasts with works showing that 14N/15N in the atmosphere of Mars can easily fractionate from the terrestrial value to its current value due to escape processes within the lifetime of the solar system. The difference between how nitrogen fractionates in Mars and Titan’s atmospheres presents a puzzle for the fractionation of isotopes in an atmosphere due to atmospheric escape. Here, we present a method aiming at determining an upper limit to the amount of fractionation allowed to occur due to escape, which is a function of the escape flux and the column density of the atmospheric constituent. Through this approach, we demonstrate that fractionation on Titan is more limited than on Mars. When applied to Pluto, we find that any potential measurement of 14N/15N in Pluto’s atmosphere can constrain the type of escape occurring from Pluto’s atmosphere and possibly the source of nitrogen for Pluto.",

            "abstract": "The foundations of the current theories for hydraulics and mechanics of unsaturated soils have been mainly based on the empirically introduced equations. There are various characteristics of unsaturated soils for which lots of different empirical equations have been proposed such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, and effective stress parameter. One of the remarkable challenges which all current models face is hysteresis, i.e., for a certain matric suction, values of saturation, hydraulic conductivity and effective stress parameter in drying state and wetting are different. Conventional models of hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils try to account for the hysteresis phenomenon by means of different empirical equations for each hydraulic path. Hassanizadeh and Gray (1993) claimed that the hysteresis in capillary pressure-saturation curves can be modelled through the inclusion of air-water interfaces as a new independent variable [1]. It has recently been stated that the same conjecture can be made for suction stress [2]. Therefore, it seems to better portray hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils, interfaces are required as an indispensable part of the framework [3, 4]. This presentation aims at introducing the drawbacks of current theories of hydraulics and mechanics of unsaturated soils. For this purpose, the role of interfaces in the mechanics and hydraulics of unsaturated soils is explained and different possibilities to account for the contribution of interfaces are discussed. Finally, current challenges and future research directions are set forth.\n",

Because of the sensitivity to temperature, annual-mean snowfall is expected to decrease in a warming climate except in very cold regions. However, it is shown here that CMIP5 models simulate smaller fractional changes in the intensities of daily snowfall extremes than in mean snowfall for many regions and months of the year. An asymptotic theory is introduced for snowfall extremes based on the temperature dependencies of the rain-snow transition and precipitation extremes. The theory accounts for the main features of the response of snowfall extremes to warming in the simulations. A variant of the theory that better accounts for the role of dynamics will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The ionospheric conductivity distribution is essential for understanding the coupling in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system. Hall conductivities, which regulate ionospheric current flow in the direction perpendicular to both the background magnetic field and the electric field, exert control over magnetospheric configuration, including transport within the plasmasphere and reconnection in the magnetotail [Lotko et al., 2014]. Pedersen conductivities control electric field variability and, in turn, determine the distribution and intensity of Joule heating, a prominent source of upper atmospheric temperature and neutral density enhancement.\nContemporary conductivity modeling techniques rely on limiting assumptions and are 2-dimensional by design. Typically these models assume Maxwellian incoming particle energy distributions and simplistic current closure paths within an ionospheric ‘shell’ located at 110 km. We have developed a method to: 1) eliminate these assumptions and 2) allow 3-dimensional conductivity analysis using particle energy spectra provided by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. A sequential non-linear procedure then regresses the conductivities derived from DMSP data on the same basis functions used in the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure to obtain a realistic form of the covariance model, with the goal to integrate 3-dimensional conductivity analysis into the AMIE procedure. This addresses one of the primary sources of uncertainty within AMIE, and will ultimately allow more accurate characterization of high-latitude ionospheric electrodynamics. We present 3-dimensional conductivity distributions derived from satellite observations and global maps of these conductivities for the year 2010.\n\n",

            "abstract": "The complex interactions and feedbacks between humans and water are very essential issues but are poorly understood in the newly proposed discipline of socio-hydrology (Sivapalan et al., 2012). An exploratory model with the appropriate level of simplification can be valuable to improve our understanding of the co-evolution and self-organization of socio-hydrological systems driven by interactions and feedbacks operating at different scales. In this study, a simple coupled modeling framework for socio-hydrology co-evolution is developed for the Tarim River Basin in Western China, and is used to illustrate the explanatory power of such a model. The study area is the mainstream of the Tarim River, which is divided into two modeling units. The socio-hydrological system is composed of four parts, i.e., social sub-system, economic sub-system, ecological sub-system, and hydrological sub-system. In each modeling unit, four coupled ordinary differential equations are used to simulate the dynamics of the social sub-system represented by human population, the economic sub-system represented by irrigated crop area, the ecological sub-system represented by natural vegetation cover and the hydrological sub-system represented by stream discharge. The coupling and feedback processes of the four dominant sub-systems (and correspondingly four state variables) are integrated into several internal system characteristics interactively and jointly determined by themselves and by other coupled systems. For example, the stream discharge is coupled to the irrigated crop area by the colonization rate and mortality rate of the irrigated crop area in the upper reach and the irrigated area is coupled to stream discharge through irrigation water consumption. The co-evolution of the Tarim socio-hydrological system is then analyzed within this modeling framework to gain insights into the overall system dynamics and its sensitivity to the external drivers and internal system variables. In the modeling framework, the state of each subsystem is holistically described by one state variable and the framework is flexible enough to comprise more processes and constitutive relationships if they are needed to illustrate the interaction and feedback mechanisms of the human-water system.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture in the 21st Century faces significant challenges due to increases in the demand for agricultural products from a global population expected to reach 9.5 billion by 2050, changes in land use that are reducing the area of arable land worldwide, and the uncertainties associated with increasing climate variability and change. There is broad agreement that meeting these challenges will require significant changes in agro-ecosystem management at the landscape scale. In 2012, the USDA/ARS announced the reorganization of 10 existing benchmark watersheds, experimental ranges, and research farms into a Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) network. Earlier this year, the LTAR network expanded to 18 sites, including 3 led by land grant universities and/or private foundations. The central question addressed by the LTAR network is, “How do we sustain or enhance productivity, profitability, and ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems and agricultural landscapes”? All 18 LTAR sites possess rich historical databases that extend up to 100 years into the past. However as LTAR moves forward, the focus is on collecting a core set of common measurements over the next 30-50 years that can be used to draw inferences regarding the nature of agricultural sustainability and how it varies across regional and continental-scale gradients. As such, LTAR is part long-term research network and part observatory network. Rather than focusing on a single site, each LTAR has developed regional partnerships that allow it to address agro-ecosystem function in the large basins and eco-climatic zones that underpin regional food production systems. Partners include other long-term in-situ data networks (e.g., Ameriflux, CZO, GRACEnet, LTER, NEON). ‘Next steps’ include designing and implementing a cross-site experiment addressing LTAR’s central question.",

The TANDEM (Tsunamis in northern AtlaNtic : Definition of Effects by Modeling) project is a French initiative to draw lessons from the 2011 catastrophic tsunami in Japan on French coastlines, in order to provide guidance for risk assessment on the nuclear facilities in the area.\nThis project is aimed at adapting numerical methods of tsunami hazard assessment against the outstanding observation database of the 2011 tsunami, in order to apply these validated methods to the definition of the tsunami hazard for the French Atlantic and Channel coastlines.\nAs part of the TANDEM project, this work focuses on tsunami induced by landslides, and uses the CEA's model named AVALANCHE that can model simultaneously model a landslide and the resulting tsunami. AVALANCHE assumes that the landslide has a fluid-like behavior and applies shallow water/thin layer approximations to both aspect. The similarity of the resulting equations of momentum and mass conservation enables to use a single numerical scheme for both parts of the model.\nThe model is being submitted to several benchmarks to compare its response to analytical or experimental results. The first case compares the simulation result to the analytical result obtain by a fixed slide movement in one dimension and introduces the importance of the shallow water assumption in our results. The second case consists in the modeling of a wedge going down a slope and is compared to experimental results.\nThe last part of this work focuses on the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay off the South of France (NE Atlantic ocean). The slope presents scars left by large scale landslides. Investigation is carried out to identify the scenarios that could have caused paleo-tsunamis, with a special interest on the large scar of the Cap Breton (~100 millions m3). Several scenarios in this area are tested using the AVANLANCHE method in order to determine the potential threat.",

The spatial distribution of the K-H wave power in the equatorial plane shows two distinct power populations, referring to the two modes of K-H surface waves. The K-H instability starts at about 30o longitude, and grows exponentially with a spatial growth rate of 0.28 ~ 0.87 RE-1until ~45o longitude where the vortices fully develop. The wave frequency, wavelength, and phase speed are also given. The KH wavelength grows spatially with increasing distance from the sub-solar point tail-ward along the flank magnetopause. Model results show that the higher solar wind speed generates K-H waves with higher frequency under the northward IMF, and the wavelengths and the phase speeds increase with the increase of the longitude.

            "abstract": "The Andaman-Nicobar subduction is the northernmost segment of the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone and marks the western boundary of the Andaman Sea, which is a complex backarc extensional basin. We present the interpretation of a new set of deep seismic reflection data acquired across the Andaman-Nicobar forearc basin, from 8°N to 11°N, to understand the structure and evolution of the forearc basin, focusing on how the obliquity of convergence affects deformation in the forearc, as well as on the Diligent (DF) and Eastern Margin Faults (EMF). Constraining the evolution of this basin, which is strongly related to the collision of India and Eurasia, can help shed light onto present-day deformation processes along this segment of the subduction zone, where convergence is highly oblique and little data is available. We find that he DF is a backthrust and corresponds to the Mentawai (MFZ) and West Andaman Fault (WAF) systems further south, offshore Sumatra. The DF is expressed as a series of mostly landward verging folds and faults, deforming the early to late Miocene sediments. The DF seems to root from the boundary between the accretionary complex and the continental backstop, where it meets the EMF. The EMF marks the western boundary of the forearc basin; it is associated with subsidence and is expressed as a deep piggyback basin, associated with recent Pliocene to Pleistocene subsidence at the western edge of the forearc basin. The eastern edge of the forearc basin is marked by the Invisible Bank (IB), which is thought to be tilted and uplifted continental crustal block. Subsidence along the EMF and uplift and tilting of the IB seem to be related to different opening phases in the Andaman Sea. The sliver Andaman-Nicobar Fault (ANF), which is the active northward extension of the Great Sumatra sliver Fault (GSF), lies to the east of the IB, and marks the boundary between continental crust underlying the forearc basin and crust accreted at the Andaman Sea Spreading Center.",

            "abstract": "Observations from the interior of East Antarctica are essential for placing direct constraints on the ice sheet’s history over multiple glacial cycles, which also can be used to test numerical modeling of its past dynamics. In particular, laterally extensive, blue ice or ablation moraines are important archives of the former behavior of the EAIS and WAIS during at least the Pleistocene and Holocene. We can now quantify changes in the former ice surfaces using such deposits, which have been studied for decades, but have lacked chronological information. We are carrying out 10Be-26Al-3He dating and provenance initiatives at Mt. Achernar, near the head of the Law Glacier, where there is a well-preserved archive of ice sheet history extending spatially over 5-10 km and temporally over the last few hundred thousand years, during which time the climate swung between full glacial and warm interglacial changes. Here, concentric moraines are continuous and well preserved, and the entire complex is no higher than about ~30 meters above the modern EAIS surface. The cosmogenic ages steadily progress away from the EAIS, over 103 to 105 timescales. In addition, agreement of 10Be and 26Al concentrations indicate that, at least over the long term, blue ice deposits at Mt Achernar do not have a complicated history of burial and re-exposure. This is consistent with the inferred process of blue ice moraine formation that involves debris coming up from below and accumulating on the surface, when ice encounters the Transantarctic Mountains. Based on our findings we conclude that the interior of EAIS has been relatively stable for the last few 100 kyr, with ice surface elevation changes on the order of tens of meters, including 20-30 meters since the LGM. In a net sense, the EAIS has also been getting slightly lower over the last half million years or so. We hypothesize that if the interior of the EAIS had undergone major lowering or more pronounced surface changes over the time represented, we would not observe the well-preserved continuous blue ice moraines and associated overall progression in ages with distance from the EAIS.",

            "abstract": "The ion foreshock located upstream of the Earth's bow shock is populated with ions reflected back by the shock front. In-situ spacecraft measurements have clearly established the existence of two distinct populations in the upstream of the quasi-perpendicular shock region (i.e. for 45o ≤ ΘBn≤ 90o, where ΘBn is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetostatic field): (i) field-aligned ion beams (or 'FAB') characterized by a gyrotropic distribution, and (ii) gyro-phase bunched ions (or 'GPB') characterized by a NON gyrotropic distribution, which exhibits a non-vanishing perpendicular bulk velocity.\nThe use of 2D PIC simulations where full curvature effects, time of flight effects and both electrons and ions dynamics are fully described, has evidenced that the shock front itself can be the possible source of these two characteristic populations.\nA recent analysis has evidenced that both populations can be discriminated in terms of interaction time (Δtinter) with the shock front. 'GPB' and 'FAB' populations are characterized by a short (Δtinter ~ 1 τci) and much larger (Δtinter ≥ 2 τci) interaction time respectively, where τci is the ion upstream gyroperiod.\nIn addition, present statistical results evidence that:\n(i) backstreaming ions are splitted into 'FAB' and 'GPB' populations depending on their injection angle when hitting the shock front (defined between the local normal to the shock front and the gyration velocity vector).\n(ii) As a consequence, ion trajectories strongly differ between the 'FAB' and 'GPB' populations at the shock front. In particular, 'FAB' ions suffer multi-bounces along the curved front whereas 'GPB' ions make only one bounce. Such differences may explain why the 'FAB' population loses their gyro-phase coherency and become gyrotropic which is not the case for the 'GPB'.\nThen, the differences observed between 'FAB' and 'GPB' populations do not involve some distinct reflection processes as often claimed in the literature but follow from different particle time histories at the shock front. Both 'FAB' and 'GPB' ions suffer the same reflection process but only 'FAB' population loose their initial phase coherency by suffering several bounces. This important result was not expected and greatly simplifies the question of their origin.",

            "abstract": "NASA has conducted airborne tropospheric chemistry studies for about three decades. These field campaigns have generated a great wealth of observations, which are characterized by a wide range of trace gases and aerosol properties. The airborne observational data have often been used in assessment and validation of models and satellite instruments. One particular issue is a lack of consistent variable naming across field campaigns, which makes cross-mission data discovery difficult. The ASDC Toolset for Airborne Data (TAD) is being designed to meet the user community needs for manipulating aircraft data for scientific research on climate change and air quality relevant issues. As part of this effort, a common naming system was developed to provide a link between variables from different aircraft field studies. This system covers all current and past airborne in-situ measurements housed at the ASDC, as well as select NOAA missions. The TAD common variable naming system consists of 6 categories and 3 sub-levels. The top-level category is primarily defined by the physical characteristics of the measurement: e.g., aerosol, cloud, trace gases. The sub-levels were designed to organize the variables according to nature of measurement (e.g., aerosol microphysical and optical properties) or chemical structures (e.g., carbon compound). The development of the TAD common variable naming system was in consultation with staff from the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) and referenced/expanded the existing Climate and Forecast (CF) variable naming conventions. The detailed structure of the TAD common variable naming convention and its application in TAD development will be presented.",

In the present study climate parameters like rainfall, temperature, solar radiation, soil moisture, humidity etc. observed from multi-source observations like remote sensing satellite, NCEP reanalysis, India Meteorological Department (IMD) observations etc. are used to analyze the climate change over the study region in terms of the climatology, inter annual variability and trend analysis of the climate parameters at long term scale. There is a signature of increasing trend in temperature and decreasing trend in the seasonal monsoon rainfall. Impact of drought years on the sugarcane crop has been determined. To quantify the climate change the Land use Land cover (LULC) classification of the region is carried out and the relative changes in different LULC classes are discussed, which shows the agriculture is being decreased in 14 years of the analysis. Then to know the impact of climate parameters and on the sugarcane crop production, the correlation analysis of the climate parameters and sugarcane yield are presented using the real observation and which clearly showed the solar radiation is highly correlated with the sugarcane production compared to other climate parameters (Figure 1). The satellite derived NDVI is used to compute the NDVI Grand Growth Period [∑NDVI(GGP)] and the correlation of it with sugarcane crop yield for the period 2000-2013 and the empirical relation is derived, which can be implemented in future with some weather forecasting models like General Circulation Model (GCM) for the prediction of the sugarcane yield in advance.",

            "abstract": "Natural wetlands are important emitters of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4), contributing an estimated 26 - 42% to the global emissions. In these habitats CH4 is generated by methanogenic archaea mediating the terminal steps of organic matter degradation under anoxic conditions. The produced CH4 is partly oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria in oxic zones, thereby mitigating CH4 release. Various factors can influence CH4 emissions from wetlands, including the presence of vascular plants, as their aerenchyma can serve as conduits for CH4 release to the atmosphere. In the present study, we investigated the CH4 dynamics in two Swiss alpine fens (1900 - 2300 m a.s.l), and sampling locations within these fens were characterized by distinct dominant vascular plants, namely Carex spp. and Eriophorum spp.. Analyses of the microbial communities present in the fen soils were complemented by in situ measurements of CH4 emissions and analyses of physico-chemical pore water properties. Methane emissions and pore water concentrations varied depending on fen and dominating plant species, with generally higher CH4 emissions observed from the Carex dominated locations. Active methanotrophic and methanogenic microorganisms (transcripts of specific marker genes) were detected at different depths, independent of O2 and CH4 pore water concentrations. The expected separation of oxic methanotrophic and anoxic methanogenic zones was not observed. Yet, composition analyses of the different communities showed a clear clustering according to fen and dominating plant species. Within each location, variation of composition with depth was only observed for the methanogenic communities. Detailed profiling of CH4 emissions with respect to changes in light and temperature is currently being carried out. Our results represent a comprehensive in situ study on factors affecting CH4 emissions from alpine fens, highlighting the influence of vascular plants on the microbial communities involved.",

            "abstract": "Hubbard Glacier is one of the few advancing tidewater glaciers in the world, offering a premier opportunity for studying ice/sediment/seawater interactions at a tidewater glacier front that is in contact with the stabilizing submarine morainal bank. However, the seafloor and water column proximal to the ice face of a marine-terminating glacier is one of the most challenging and extreme environments imaginable for marine survey work. Frequently choked with constantly-shifting mélange ice at the sea surface and at risk from calving, surface vessels cannot operate safely proximal to the ice face. AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) technology provides an opportunity to survey in areas where surface vessels cannot. Operating well below the sea surface the AUV can operate without hindrance or danger to human operators. In addition, the AUV can be programmed to operate close to the seafloor at a constant altitude, enabling the finest-detail currently possible for acoustic seafloor mapping and consistent resolution irrespective of water depth. With these considerations in mind, we conducted a proof-of-concept survey of the Hubbard Glacier morainal bank in June, 2014. We utilized the Bluefin 9M, the smallest of their line of AUVs. Its size enabled deployment and recovery from a small charter fishing vessel well-suited to navigating through mélange-choked waters. The AUV’s payload included a Klein UUV-3500 interferometric sonar (455/900 kHz), which enables acquisition of sidescan backscatter and swath bathymetry up to ~75 m to each side of the instrument from ~10 m altitude over the seabed, and sensors for measuring conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD) and optical backscatter (OBS). Although our operations were shortened due to an unfortunate failure in the sonar electronics, sufficient data were collected along the morainal bank to clearly prove the viability of AUV operations in this harsh environment. The data provide centimeter-scale seafloor detail close to the glacier in regions that could not be surveyed with surface vessels. We observed a number of intricate geomorphic features in the raw images that are to our knowledge without precedent. Of particular interest are a series of barchan-shaped bedforms that may provide evidence of significant turbidity flows down the face of the morainal bank.",

            "abstract": "A well-preserved set of mid-Miocene tuff-cones and their feeders outcrop in the Jičín Volcanic Field, Czech Republic. Zebín Hill is a tuff cone that has been quarried to reveal the volcanoes feeder system. This edifice offers the opportunity to understand how magma is transported through a monogenetic pyroclastic cone. Rock types include a coarse-grained basal phreatomagmatic layer and a stratified upper wall facies both of which are penetrated by feeder dikes. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and paleomagnetic data were collected at twenty-one sites from feeder dikes and the main conduit of the volcano. A high-resolution ground magnetometry survey, electric resistivity tomography and seismic tomography were also conducted. Magnetic susceptibility intensity indicates that the dominant magnetic mineral is a ferromagnetic phase with little contribution from paramagnetic minerals. AMS ellipsoids shapes are both oblate and prolate and inferred magma flow directions indicate magma flow away from the central vent area and subhorizontal flow towards and away from the axial conduit; both upward and downward magma flow is evident at some sites. Curie point estimates yield a spectrum of results indicating a mixture of high-Ti titanomagnetite, iron sulfide, and low-Ti titanomagnetite. Ground magnetometry data indicate that both normal and reverse polarity rocks are present at Zebín Hill. Paleomagnetic data confirm the ground magnetic data in that both normal and reverse polarity rocks are present. Most sites yield a single component magnetization that is well grouped at the site level and carried by pseudosingle domain titanomagnetite. The presence of both normal and reverse polarity magnetizations from the volcano indicate that significant time passed during the growth of this monogenic system. Complex system of branching dikes has been also observed from electric resistivity tomography. The simple external structure of monogenetic volcanoes hides a rather complex magmatic plumbing system that dynamically evolves during the life of the volcano. As we show, the well-exposed roots of Zebín Hill reveals that the growth of a volcano occurs not due to simple central axis feeder systems but rather through interplay of local structures, magmatic effects, and construct evolution during the life of the volcano",

            "abstract": "Contemporary sensing equipment is miniaturized to scales that enable implementation of dynamic micro-sensors within natural sediment particles (>c.80mm diameter) containing artificial enclosures. The resulting mobile sensing units record the dynamics of sediment transport from the inertial frame of individual particles, giving an insight on how individual grains experience transporting forces. However, it remains difficult to obtain accurate real-time positional information which is critical for understanding the dynamic data. We have developed a sensing system optimized for monitoring the movement of sediment grains in rivers, which comprises a high-frequency 3-D force unit and an external magnetic telemetry system for accurate positional information. Here we present results from the experimental evaluation of two prototype mobile sensors: the first prototype is a spherically enclosed wireless accelerometer platform (± 6g range) tested through a series of incipient motion experiments under varying slope conditions (0.8 m x 5 m flume, slope range: 0.026 to 0.57, flow increase: 0.037 l.s-2, University of British Columbia). The second prototype is a complete Inertial Measurement Unit (assembly of a 3-axis micro-accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer capable of resolving 9 Degrees Of Freedom for the movement of the unit), enhanced with a 3-axis high-resolution impact sensor calibrated for low frequency/high magnitude impacts (±150g range) and equipped with a system of magnetic coil receivers permitting telemetric tracking of the unit with a 4 Hz frequency. This unit was tested through experiments of sequential displacements under varying flow increase (gradual increase: 0.04 l.s-2, episodic increase: 0.1 l.s-2, 0.9 m x 7.5 m flume, slope: 0.02, University of Glasgow). The position was recorded from a lab-scale Magneto-Inductive tracking system and the positional accuracy was tested by cross-comparison with a video recording. Along with the presented results we discuss how the nature, high-resolution and accuracy of the derived measurements mean that collected data can be used to existing deterministic and stochastic models for fluvial bedload transport.",

            "abstract": "The EarthScope USArray Transportable Array (TA) has provided a great opportunity for imaging the detailed lithospheric structure beneath the continental US. In this presentation, we will report our recent progress on constructing detailed 3D isotropic and anisotropic crustal models of the contiguous US using Rayleigh wave phase velocity and ellipticity measurements across TA. In particular, we will discuss our recent methodology development of extracting short period Rayleigh wave ellipticity, or Rayleigh-wave H/V (horizontal to vertical) amplitude ratios, using multicomponent noise cross-correlations. To retain the amplitude ratio information between vertical and horizontal components, for each station, we perform daily noise pre-processing (temporal normalization and spectrum whitening) simultaneously for all three components. For each station pair, amplitude measurements between cross-correlations of different components (radial–radial, radial–vertical, vertical–radial and vertical–vertical) are then used to determine the Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios at the two station locations. Measurements from all available station pairs are used to determine isotropic and directionally dependent Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios at each location between 8- and 24-second period. The isotropic H/V ratio maps, combined with previous longer period Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio maps from earthquakes and Rayleigh-wave phase velocity maps from both ambient noise and earthquakes, are used to invert for a new 3-D isotropic crustal and upper-mantle model in the western United States. The new model has an outstanding vertical resolution in the upper crust and tradeoffs between different parameters are mitigated. A clear 180-degree periodicity is observed in the directionally dependent H/V ratio measurements for many locations where upper crustal anisotropy is likely strong. Across the US, good correlation is observed between the inferred fast directions in the upper crust and documented maximum compressive stress directions. This suggests that the observed H/V ratio anisotropy can potentially be used to infer static stress field across the US.",

            "abstract": "The global biogeochemical cycling of silicon (Si) is intrinsically linked to the fate of CO2 in the earth’s atmosphere. To date, most research has focused on the oceanic cycling of Si over glacial/interglacial timescales although, the importance of continental Si cycling (via abiotic and biotic processes) is now being addressed. Especially as the significant potential for Si sequestration in continental lake systems has been recently highlighted [1].\nWe present the first large-scale silicon isotope (δ30SiDSi) profiles of Lake Baikal’s water column, where a comparison between both pre- and post-diatom growing season δ30SiDSi signatures are made. Samples were collected along a water profile (surface to 180 m) at numerous sites across Lake Baikal, with deep-water endmembers at 400 m and c. 1,500 m. All isotopic analyses were conducted on a Neptune + Multi-Collector ICP-MS at NIGL, UK, using wet plasma mode with Mg doping of samples and standard-sample-standard bracketing. Analytical reproducibility is 0.12‰ (2σ) and blanks are <1% of signal intensity.\nDSi concentrations of March water surface samples (South Basin only) range between c. 0.74 and 1.23 ppm while those collected in August are all <0.70 ppm, following seasonal biological utilisation. In turn Chlorophyll a values from South Basin profiles in August are greater (between c. 1.46 to 3.18 mg l-1) than March surface values (<0.70 mg l-1). Indeed, March δ30SiDSi surface values range between c. +2.16 and +2.45‰ while summer surface values range between c. +2.20 and +2.84‰, reflecting residual pool depletion after summer biological utilisation. δ30SiDSi values are >1‰ more enriched than dominant lake water inflows again reflecting diatom Si uptake. Annual open sediment traps deployed down Lake Baikal’s water column yield δ30Sidiatom signatures of +1.25‰, which suggests that down-column diatom dissolution is minimal. Applying the diatom fractionation factor of -1.1‰[2] and adopting a closed system model approach, these data are applied to mass balance diatom utilisation in Lake Baikal.\n[1]Frings at al, 2014.

Until recently, it would have been nearly impossible to find it, except on accident. In recent months, a major effort has been underway to improve how physical data is stored in the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Between consolidating the physical space available to almost half of its original square footage, reduced resources, and reducing storage costs, it's more important than ever to make sure potential users of the data can find what they are looking for and have access to it from anywhere in the world. The NCDC has been working on several projects to meet these needs, including: catalog improvement to cater to vast collection of users, increased access to information about our datasets, centralized access when possible, and implementing a policy to make physical datasets searchable and discoverable.",

            "abstract": "Climate extremes have resulted in widespread reductions in mean ecosystem productivity, and therefore attracted a lot of studies. Using global satellite and climate products (2000-2011), this study shows that the early 21st century is water-limited for global biomes, i.e. productivity is proportional to water availability irrespective of dry or wet climate regimes. Cross-biome water-use efficiency is convergent to a single value for all of the driest, wettest and mean climate regimes in this period. No change in WUE along aridity gradient was found at cross-biome levels. Climatic variability generally tends to decrease mean NPP (net primary productivity) but increases NPP variability; however, climatic variability and extremes may affect ecosystem functioning in different and even contrasting ways for different biomes. Impact of dry extremes on reductions in vegetation productivity dominates over effects of wet extremes on productivity increases in the early 21st century. Future projections of climate forcing and ecosystem response should move beyond evaluation of “mean” behavior, and towards “variability” and “extremes”.",

ENA imagers onboard Chandrayaan and IBEX observed that ~20% of the solar wind protons are reflected as energetic neutral hydrogen atoms. Laboratory measurements will be presented on the energy and angular distribution of energetic neutral atoms (ENA) reflecting from powered targets. Mass selected H+ and He2+ pulsed ion beams were used to simulate the solar wind impacting an Apollo 17 breccia powered sample. A low energy ion, 0.1 to 5 keV, impacting a surface loses energy by ionization, secondary electron emission, excitation, and kinetic/potential sputtering. When the straggling of these low energy ions becomes comparable to the penetration depth, the result is backscattering of ions and ENAs. A Quantar® imaging detector has been used to determine the angular distribution and yield of ENA’s. Time-of-flight analysis has been performed to resolve the ENA kinetic energy distribution of this complex multi-scattering process.",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations are a cost effective tool for monitoring large numbers of volcanoes in areas with scarce instrumentation or difficult access. In the context of the 2012 Santorini Report on satellite Earth Observation and Geohazards, CEOS (Committee on Earth Observation Satellites) has developed a pilot project to showcase remote sensing for volcano hazard mitigation and response. Specifically, the pilot aims to demonstrate the feasibility of global volcano monitoring of Holocene volcanoes by undertaking regional monitoring of volcanic arcs in Latin America, using satellite earth observations data to track deformation as well as gas, ash, and thermal emissions. Latin America was chosen because the volcanoes are situated in a diversity of environments, providing a good test of the capabilities of different types of satellite data under different conditions; volcanic activity is abundant, and monitoring agencies in Latin American countries would directly benefit from the resources that this pilot will make available. It is hoped that the regional study will demonstrate that Earth observation data can help to identify volcanoes that may become active in the future as well as track eruptive activity that may impact populations and infrastructure on the ground and in the air, ultimately leading to improved targeting for permanent satellite-based observations and in-situ volcanic monitoring efforts. The pilot project is posible thanks to data provided by the various space agencies (ESA, ASI, DLR, JAXA, NASA, CNES, CSA).\nIn this contribution, we focus on premilinary ground deformation results using SAR satellites for selected areas in the Northern and Southern Andes as well as the Caribbean with recent unrest. For example, in the Southern Andes we will present ALOS time series at Llaima (-38.7 S) and Peteroa (-35.2 S) volcanoes, both of which have had eruptions during the past ten years.",

            "abstract": "While the impact of rapid (i.e. sub-daily) fluctuations in climatic forcing on short-term fluctuations in water and carbon fluxes is rarely disputed, their aggregate effect on long-term fluxes and stores of carbon and water continues to be the subject of active research.\nA process based ecohydrological model was used to unfold the effect of short time scale variability in precipitation, temperature and radiation on the water and carbon cycles across different climatic regimes and biomes worldwide. Specifically, synthetic climate inputs are first generated with prescribed statistical properties, modifying the small scale structure of each of the investigated forcing variable to evaluate its impact on ecosystem fluxes and stores at all temporal scales. The key statistical properties investigated here include: precipitation extremes, correlation structure, intermittency and its inter- and intra-storm structure; temperature distribution and correlation; and radiation distribution and their correlation structure. A statistical analysis and mechanistic explanations of how climate variability at short temporal scales affects evapotranspiration (ET) and its two components, net and gross primary productivity and vegetation dynamics at a wide range of temporal scales spanning from hourly to inter-annual is provided.\nThe main result is that short-lived excursions in climate forcings play a major role in controlling water, energy and carbon fluxes at all temporal scales. This finding is supported by the fact that nonlinearities describing the pathways by which climate variables impact carbon and water fluxes at short time scale do not necessarily ‘weaken’ with increasing temporal scales due to feedbacks and ‘soft’ thresholds and switches. The feedbacks, thresholds and switches depend on the limiting factor for each of the climatic regimes and are not expected to be universal, but site specific. Furthermore, the responses are mostly dependent on climate, rather than vegetation type. A future goal is include such effects in dynamic vegetation models using parameterization schemes that are aware of such cross-scale information flow.",

            "abstract": "The Total Electron Content (TEC) is being extensively used to monitor the ionospheric behavior under geomagnetically quiet and disturbed conditions. The complex effects of magnetospheric convection and geomagnetic disturbances on ionospheric electric fields and currents in middle and low latitudes were documented in several studies. Under disturbed conditions the two main sources of electric fields, which are responsible for changes in the plasma drifts and for current perturbations, are the short-lived prompt penetration electric fields (PPEFs) and the longer lasting ionospheric disturbance dynamo (DD) electric fields, and both modulate the TEC around the globe. In this work we present the validation of a computational tool to calculate TEC maps over the low latitude of South America region. We used two methods to calculate the absolute VTEC: TECMAP-Nagoya tool and Magic (NOAA) tool. Their results were compared to the TEC measured by an Allen Osborne receiver placed at São José dos Campos (Brazil) and show a good agreement. The results were performed considering quiet and disturbed conditions, and also HILDCAAs events. Data from the RBMC/IBGE (Brazil), IGS and RAMSAC (Argentina) networks were used to calculate TEC over the South America. The expansion of RBMC and RAMSAC networks is providing a good coverage and understanding of TEC behavior at this complex low latitude region.",

            "abstract": "We report the in situ observation of the magnetospheric ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves with an increasing amplitude induced by solar wind dynamic pressure changes. We examine the magnetospheric responses to solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements from April 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012, and find six ULF wave events with slow but clear wave amplitude increase. The amplitudes of ion velocities and magnetic field of these waves continuously increase by 2.1 ∼ 4.4 times during three to six wave cycles. We choose two typical cases to further investigate the cause of this wave amplitude increase. We find that the wave amplitude growth is mainly contributed by the toroidal mode wave. Interestingly, toroidal mode waves are standing, while compressional and poloidal mode waves are not. Thus, we suspect that the wave amplitude increase may be caused by the superposition of two wave sources. One wave source is the standing wave excited by the solar wind dynamic impulse. Additionally, fast mode compressional wave continuously shakes the magnetic field lines. The azimuthal component of this magnetic perturbation is the second wave source. Furthermore, the simple model calculation of superposing two waves match the observations pretty well.",

            "abstract": "Most time dependent rupture probability (TDRP) models are basically designed for a single-mode rupture, i.e. a single characteristic earthquake on a fault. However, most subduction zones rupture in complex patterns that create overlapping earthquakes of different magnitudes. Additionally, the limited historic earthquake data does not provide sufficient information to estimate reliable mean recurrence intervals for earthquakes. This makes it difficult to identify a single characteristic earthquake for TDRP analysis. Physical models based on geodetic data have been successfully used to obtain information on the state of coupling and slip deficit rates for subduction zones. Coupling information provides valuable insight into the complexity of subduction zone rupture processes.\nIn this study we present a TDRP model that is formulated based on subduction zone slip deficit rate distribution. A subduction zone is represented by an integrated network of cells. Each cell ruptures multiple times from numerous earthquakes that have overlapping rupture areas. The rate of rupture for each cell is calculated using a moment balance concept that is calibrated based on historic earthquake data. The information in conjunction with estimates of coseismic slip from past earthquakes is used to formulate time dependent rupture probability models for cells. Earthquakes on the subduction zone and their rupture probabilities are calculated by integrating different combinations of cells. The resulting rupture probability estimates are fully consistent with the state of coupling of the subduction zone and the regional and local earthquake history as the model takes into account the impact of all large (M>7.5) earthquakes on the subduction zone. The granular rupture model as developed in this study allows estimating rupture probabilities for large earthquakes other than just a single characteristic magnitude earthquake. This provides a general framework for formulating physically-based rupture probability models for large earthquakes on subduction zones that is consistent with their true locking state and earthquake history. We will present the formulation of the proposed model and its application to the Nazca plate subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Deep seismic data represent a key to understand the geometry and mechanism of continental rifting. The passive continental margin of NW-Africa is one of the oldest on earth, formed during the Upper Triassic–Lower Liassic rifting of the central Atlantic Ocean over 200 Ma. We present new and existing wide-angle and reflection seismic data from three study regions along the margin located in the North Moroccan salt basin, on the central continental margin offshore Safi and in the south, offshore Dakhla. In each of the study areas several combined wide-angle and reflection seismic profiles perpendicular and parallel to the margin have been acquired and forward modelled using comparable methods. The thickness of unthinned continental crust decreases from 36 km in the North to about 27 km in the South. In the North Moroccan Basin continental crust thins from originally 36 km to about 8 km in a 150 km wide zone. The basin itself is underlain by highly thinned continental crust. Offshore safi thinning of the continental crust is confined to a 130 km wide zone with no neighboring sedimentary basin underlain by continental crust. In both areas the zone of crustal thinning is characterised by the presence of large blocks and abundant salt diapirs. In the south crustal thinning is more rapid in a zone of 90 km and asymmetric with the upper crust thinning more closely to the continent than the lower crust, probably due to depth-dependent stretching and the presence of the precambrian Reguibat Ridge on land. Oceanic crust is characterised by a thickness of 7-8 km along the complete margin. Relatively high velocities of up to 7.5 km/s have been imaged between magnetic anomalies S1 and M25, and are probably related to changes in the spreading velocities at the time of the Kimmeridgian/Tithonian plate reorganisation. Volcanic activity seems to be confined to the region next to the Canary Islands, and is thus not related to the initial opening of the oceanic, which was related to no or only weak volcanism.",

We set out to address this situation by quantifying the unique and shared contributions to global leaf-trait variation from soils and climate.\nUsing a trait dataset comprising 1509 species from 288 sites, with climate and soil data derived from global datasets, we quantified the effects of soil and climate properties on photosynthetic traits: light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Aarea), stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs), leaf N and P (Narea and Parea) and specific leaf area (SLA). We used mixed regression models, multivariate analyses and variance partitioning.\nAlong a first dimension of soil fertility, soil pH covaried positively with measures of base status and climatic aridity, and negatively with soil organic C content. Along this dimension from low to high soil pH, Narea, Parea and Aarea increased and SLA decreased.\nAlong an independent dimension of soil fertility, gs declined and Parea increased with soil available P (Pavail). Overall, soil variables were stronger predictors of leaf traits than were climate variables, except for SLA. Importantly, soils and climate were not redundant information to explain leaf trait variation but were not additive either. Shared effects of soil and climate dominated over their independent effects on Narea and Parea, while unique effects of soils dominated for Aarea and gs.\nThree environmental variables were key for explaining variation in leaf traits: soil pH and Pavail, and climatic aridity. Although the reliability of global soils datasets lags behind that of climate datasets our results nonetheless provide compelling evidence that both can now be taken into account in broad-scale analyses, and that effects uniquely attributable to soil properties are important determinants of leaf photosynthetic traits and rates. Understanding what soils tell us (that climate does not) is an important step to progress towards more reliable modelling of global vegetation function.",

            "abstract": "The phase shift and amplitude ratio of the diurnal temperature signal of paired streambed temperature sensors have already been used successfully to calculate vertical groundwater fluxes assuming a constant vertical distance between the sensors. Sedimentation and scouring however, can change the position of temperature sensors relative to the streambed influencing calculated groundwater fluxes. Here we report on a field investigation, where streambed sediment temperature time series were used to; (i) determine the range of natural sedimentation and scour over a two month period, (ii) study the influence of rain events on the calculated streambed elevation.\nThe study was carried out at a field site located along Holtum stream, in Western Denmark. The 3 m wide stream has a sandy streambed, a mean discharge of 200 l/s and a mean depth of 0.3 m. Streambed temperatures were measured at two locations in a straight stream section with a vertical high-resolution Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system installed 0.7 m deep in the streambed. Temperature measurements were taken with 30 min intervals between 16 April and 25 June 2013 and streambed elevation was recorded on 24 May and 17 June 2013. The effective thermal diffusivity (κe ) of streambed sediments was measured on 17 June 2013 by a KD2 Pro SH-1 sensor (Decagon Devices).\nThe phase and amplitude of the diurnal temperature signal of paired sensors were extracted by VFLUX. The κe of streambed sediments was calibrated based on measured streambed elevations and validated by in-situ measurements. The range of potential streambed elevation over the two month period was calculated by assuming; (i) sedimentation, using the calibrated κe for saturated streambed sediments, (ii) scouring, using κe for stream water between the temperature sensors.\nUnder natural conditions, streambed elevation changes by 5-12 cm during the two month period and by 1-3 cm even during base flow conditions, emphasizing the importance of sensor location relative to the streambed. During rain events however, streambed elevation was overestimated by up to 8 cm due to the rain-induced disturbance in the diurnal streambed temperature signal which could potentially also lead to uncertainties in calculated groundwater fluxes.",

It is shown that the mean Fourier power spectra of emission from active region cores, above sunspots, in loop footpoints and in the quiet Sun, follow an approximate power-law behaviour. We show that power-law power-spectra can be formed by summing a distribution of exponentially decaying emission events along the line of sight, consistent with the idea that the corona is heated everywhere by small energy deposition events. We also examine changes in Fourier power spectrum as a function of coronal loop height to look for evidence of a preferred location to coronal heating. The observed power-law power spectra also have implications for coronal seismology, as all existing observational studies do not take into account the power-law power spectrum of the coronal emission and its attendant statistical properties. We show that random fluctuations in the emission can be mis-identified as oscillatory signal, and give suggestions on how to detect oscillatory motions above a background power-law power spectrum.",

            "abstract": "The LASEA 2013 cruise was executed in August 2013 in the northern margin of the Gulf of Cádiz, with the main goal of collecting data from the Guadiana River-influenced shelf, in order to: (1) study changes affecting the entire drainage basin; (2) correlate shelf unit sequences with the upper slope sedimentary record, composed dominantly of contourite deposits in specific stretches of the margin. As a first approach, attention is paid to the most obvious sedimentary manifestation of the influence of the river on the shelf domain, represented by the Guadiana incised-valley system. The database comprises both geophysical and sedimentological records. Geophysical data include multibeam bathymetry, TOPAS profiles and single-channel Sparker seismic profiles. Sedimentological data include sediment cores collected with gravity- and vibro-corer devices.\nThe lowstand erosional surface was mapped across the shelf. The lowstand surface exhibits two clearly contrasting patterns. In the outer shelf the surface isrepresented by an erosional truncation that can be planar or irregular. The lowstand surface is much more difficult to follow in the inner shelf, due to the amalgamation of erosional surfaces and the frequent stacking of coarse-grained deposits.\nIncised valleys are recognized at shallow waters (20-30 m) the most significant of them is at least 1.5 km wide in the most proximal (recognized) section, decreasing seawards in width. The internal architecture of the valley exhibits the intercalation of laterally prograding sediment bodies and high-amplitude, subparallel configurations laterally related to valley margin prograding wedges.\nThe internal facies architecture suggests a transition from relatively high-energy fluvial to proximal estuarine environment to a lower-energy estuarine depositional environment. Thus, the study of the valley extension into the shelf is expected to provide clues for the recent reorganization of the entire fluvial system, during the course of the postglacial sea-level rise and ensuing sea-level stabilization.\nAcknowledgements: this study was completed in the framework of the project CGL2011-30302-C02-02.

            "abstract": "Our team at the National Center for Interactive Learning at the Space Science Institute has developed Starchitect, an end-to-end stellar and planetary evolution game available both on Facebook and externally. Supported by NSF and NASA, the game uses the \"sporadic play\" model of games such as Farmville, where players might only take actions a few times a day, but continue playing for months. This framework is an excellent fit for teaching about the evolution of stars and planets. Players select regions of the galaxy to build their systems, and watch as they evolve in scaled real time (a million years to the minute). Massive stars will supernova within minutes, while lower mass stars like our sun will live for weeks, possibly evolving life before passing through a red giant stage and ending their lives as white dwarfs.\nStarchitect provides a wide variety of opportunities for communicating astronomy concepts, targeting known misconceptions, and encouraging players to dig deeper through external sites. The game directly addresses stellar lifecycles, habitable zones, and the roles of giant worlds in creating habitable solar systems as part of its core design. Meanwhile minigames can focus on additional concepts. For instance, the game’s solar system visualization engine allows players to \"fake\" planetary scales to create more attractive images of their systems (which can then be posted to their Facebook wall), but this ability must be unlocked through completion of a minigame that looks at the relative scales of planets, moons, and solar system distances. Starchitect also incorporates current science through links to external content, science \"Factlets\", all-sky maps generated by missions, and more. Finally, the game is heavily instrumented to allow us to analyze the resulting gameplay in conjunction with Facebook’s demographic data.\nThis presentation will focus on the release, evaluation, and ongoing refinement of the game as well as its overall goals, which include reaching a broad audience with basic astronomy concepts as well as current science results; exploring the potential of social, “sporadic play” games in education; and determining if platforms such as Facebook allow us to reach significantly different demographics than are generally targeted by educational games.",

            "abstract": "Since the earthquake rupture process is extremely heterogeneous, it is vital to understand how structural variations in the overriding plate and downgoing slab may control slip style along the subduction megathrust. The large-scale 3-D geometry of subduction plate boundaries is rapidly becoming well understood; however, the nature of any finer-scale structure along the plate interface remains elusive. A detailed study of earthquake source mechanisms along a megathrust region can shed light on the nature of fine-scale structures along the megathrust.\nThe Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake that struck central Chile in 2010 is the sixth largest earthquake ever recorded. Following the earthquake, there was an international deployment of seismic stations in the rupture area, making this one of the best datasets of an aftershock sequence following a large earthquake. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to perform a detailed study of megathrust earthquake source mechanisms.\nBased on a high-resolution 3-D velocity model and robust earthquake locations [Hicks et al., 2014], we calculate regional moment tensors using the ISOLA software package [Sokos & Zahradnik, 2008]. We incorporate accelerometer recordings, important for constraining solutions of large earthquakes in the overriding plate. We also validate the robustness of our solutions by assessing the consistency of mechanisms with P-wave polarities observed at both onshore and offshore seismic stations, and compare them to already published solutions. We find that accurate earthquake locations are vital for the fine-scale interpretation of focal mechanisms, particularly for offshore events.\nOur results show that most moment tensor solutions with thrusting mechanisms have a nodal plane dipping parallel to the subducting plate interface. Interestingly, we also find earthquakes with normal faulting mechanisms lying along to the megathrust plate interface in the south of the rupture area. This finding suggests that megathrust slip style can be highly variable across the megathrust, with implications for fault processes such as postseismic fluid release. We also perform 3-D full waveform forward simulation using the spectral element code, SPECFEM3D, to understand the sensitivity of our moment tensor solutions with respect to 3-D velocity structure.",

In engineered systems, combined nitritation-anammox is an efficient process to remove N from ammonium-rich wastewater, with nitrite as the central intermediate. During the anammox process, nitrate is being produced, providing reducing equivalents for carbon fixation. Measuring the N isotope ratios in fixed N species (i.e., ammonium, nitrite, nitrate) has proven to be a valuable tool to track N cycling in freshwater and marine ecosystems, yet its application in wastewater treatment as a tool to diagnose nitrate production pathways is novel. In this presentation we will elucidate, and compare, the N isotope effects associated with anammox 1) in vitro, 2) in a lacustrine setting, and 3) in a small-scale batch reactor for wastewater treatment. We demonstrate that the anammox nitrite/nitrate isotopic signatures are modulated by the superposition of strong kinetic (normal and inverse) and equilibrium (nitrite-nitrate) N isotope fractionation. The ammonium N isotope effect is driven by kinetic N isotope fractionation, and is similar to that of nitrification. We will discuss the possible controls on the expression of the anammox N isotope effects in the natural environment. We will also evaluate the use of nitrate/nitrite N (and O) isotope signatures to distinguish between nitrate production by anammox versus nitrite oxidation, which is important for optimizing process efficiency during wastewater treatment.",

Using a fully kinetic model including the effect of Coulomb collisions, the expansion of the solar wind, as well as the self consistent large scale electric field needed to preserve quasi neutrality and zero current, we indeed observe the electron heat flux in very good agreement with observations. However, closer inspection of the heat flux properties, such as its dependence on the thermodynamic quantities and its variation with the distance, shows that for Knudsen number between 0.02 and 0.3 the heat flux is still not conveniently described by the Spitzer-Härm formula. Moreover, the good agreement between our model - that does not include wave-particle interactions - and the heat flux in the solar wind in the high Knudsen regime suggests that at 1AU the heat flux intensity is not constrained by electromagnetic instabilities, wave-particle and wave-wave interactions.",

However, secondary environmental and biological factors modify the net apparent fractionation between precipitation δD and leaf wax δD, limiting quantitative reconstruction of paleohydrology. These secondary factors include soil evaporation, leaf transpiration, biosynthetic fractionation, and the seasonal timing of lipid synthesis. Here, we investigate the influence of each of these factors on n-alkyl lipid δD in five dominant deciduous angiosperm tree species as well as shrubs, ferns and grasses in the watershed surrounding Brown’s Lake Bog, Ohio, USA. We quantified n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid concentrations and δD in replicate individuals of each species at weekly to monthly intervals from March to October 2014 to assess inter- and intraspecific isotope variability throughout the growing season. We present soil, xylem and leaf water δD from each individual, and precipitation and atmospheric water vapor δD throughout the season to directly examine the relationship between source water and lipid isotope composition. These data allow us to assess the relative influence of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration among plant types, within species, and along a soil moisture gradient throughout the catchment. We use leaf water δD to approximate biosynthetic fractionation for each individual and test whether this is a species-specific and seasonal constant, and to evaluate variation among plant types with identical growth conditions. Our high frequency sampling approach provides new insights into the seasonal timing of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid synthesis and subsequent fluctuations in concentration and δD in a temperate deciduous forest. These results will advance understanding of the magnitude and timing of secondary influences on the modern leaf wax δD signal, thereby improving paleohydrology information extracted from leaf wax δD.",

            "abstract": "Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), typically defined as depressional wetlands surrounded by uplands, support an array of hydrological and ecological processes. However, key research questions concerning the hydrological connectivity of GIWs and their impacts on downgradient surface waters remain unanswered. This is particularly important for regulation and management of these systems. For example, in the past decade United States Supreme Court decisions suggest that GIWs can be afforded protection if significant connectivity exists between these waters and traditional navigable waters. Here we developed a simulation procedure to quantify the effects of various spatial distributions of GIWs across the landscape on the downgradient hydrograph using a refined version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a catchment-scale hydrological simulation model. We modified the SWAT FORTRAN source code and employed an alternative hydrologic response unit (HRU) definition to facilitate an improved representation of GIW hydrologic processes and connectivity relationships to other surface waters, and to quantify their downgradient hydrological effects. We applied the modified SWAT model to an ~ 202 km2 catchment in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, exhibiting a substantial population of mapped GIWs. Results from our series of GIW distribution scenarios suggest that: (1) Our representation of GIWs within SWAT conforms to field-based characterizations of regional GIWs in most respects; (2) GIWs exhibit substantial seasonally-dependent effects upon downgradient base flow; (3) GIWs mitigate peak flows, particularly following high rainfall events; and (4) The presence of GIWs on the landscape impacts the catchment water balance (e.g., by increasing groundwater outflows). Our outcomes support the hypothesis that GIWs have an important catchment-scale effect on downgradient streamflow.",

            "abstract": "To evaluate the improvement of city-scale emission inventory, a high-resolution emission inventory of air pollutants for Nanjing is first developed combining detailed source information, and then justified through quantitative analysis with observations. The best available domestic emission factors and unit-/facility-based activity level data were compiled based on a thorough field survey on major emission sources. Totally 1089 individual emission sources were identified as point sources and all the emission-related parameters including burner type, combustion technology, fuel quality, and removal efficiency of pollution control devices, are carefully investigated and analyzed. Some new data such as detailed information of city fueling-gas stations, construction sites, monthly activity level, data from continuous emission monitoring systems and traffic flow information were combined to improve spatiotemporal distribution of this inventory. For SO2, NOX and CO, good spatial correlations were found between ground observation (9 state controlling air sampling sites in Nanjing) and city-scale emission inventory (R2=0.34, 0.38 and 0.74, respectively). For TSP, PM10 and PM2.5, however, poorer correlation was found due to relatively weaker accuracy in emission estimation and spatial distribution of road dust. The mixing ratios between specific pollutants including OC/EC, BC/CO and CO2/CO, are well correlated between those from ground observation and emission. Compared to MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China), there is a better spatial consistence between this city-scale emission inventory and NO2 measured by OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument). In particular, the city-scale emission inventory still correlated well with satellite observations (R2=0.28) while the regional emission inventory showed little correlation with satellite observations (R2=0.09) when grids containing power plants are excluded. It thus confirms the improvement of city-scale emission inventory on industrial and transportation sources other than big power plants. Through the inventory evaluation, the necessity to develop high-resolution emission inventory with comprehensive emission source information is revealed for atmospheric science studies and air quality improvement at local scale.",

            "abstract": "Porous carbonates form important reservoirs for water and hydrocarbons. The fluid flow properties of carbonate reservoirs may be affected by post-depositional processes (e.g., mechanical and chemical), which need to be quantified. Field-based studies described bed-parallel compaction bands (CBs) within carbonates with a wide range of porosities. These burial-related structures accommodate volumetric strain by grain rotation, translation, pore collapse and pressure solution. Recently, the same structures have been reproduced for the first time in the laboratory by performing triaxial compaction experiments on porous grainstones. These laboratory studies characterized and compared the microstructures of natural and laboratory CBs, but no analysis of pore connectivity has been performed.\nIn this paper, we use an innovative approach to characterize the pore networks (e.g. porosity, connectivity) of natural and laboratory CBs and compare them with the host rock one.\nWe collected the data using the synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography technique at the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste Laboratory (Italy). Quantitative analyses of the samples were performed with the Pore3D software library. The porosity was calculated from segmented 3D images of pristine and deformed carbonates. A process of skeletonization was then applied to quantify the number of connected pores within the rock volume. The analysis of the skeleton allowed us to highlight the differences between natural and laboratory CBs, and to investigate how pore connectivity evolves as a function of different deformation pathways.\nBoth pore volume and connectivity are reduced within the CBs respect to the pristine rock and the natural CB has a lower porosity with respect to the laboratory one. The grain contacts in the natural CB are welded, whereas in the laboratory one they have more irregular shapes and grain crushing is the predominant process.",

This location is one of the newest international sites in the USGS Global Fiducial Program (GFP)—a program which provides systematic monitoring of dynamic and environmentally critical areas with high-resolution imagery (http://gfp.usgs.gov/). In 2008, Lago Cachet Dos began experiencing glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) during which the entire pool of water (about 200 million m3) rapidly drains from the lake and flows south-southeast through the Colonia Glacier. These catastrophic events cause massive erosion of lake-bed and valley-fill deposits, and consequent upstream expansion of Lago Cachet Dos towards Lago Cachet Uno. Panchromatic and multispectral images for 1979, 2007, and 2014 highlight the dramatic changes that have occurred at this site over a 35-year period. The lake was smallest in 1979, when the Colonia Glacier was at its maximum thickness and extent during the study period. Between 1979 and 2007, the glacier shrank causing an increase in the surface area of the lake. The size of the lake increased substantially, from 2.98 km2 in 1979 to 4.41 km2 in 2014, primarily due to erosion of valley-fill deposits at its northern edge by the 15 GLOFs that occurred between April 2008 and February 2014. Ongoing studies of the Colonia Glacier and Lago Cachet Dos are focused on providing real-time monitoring of Lago Cachet Dos lake levels, understanding the history of advances and retreats of the Colonia Glacier, and determining the physical mechanisms and hazards associated with the GLOFs that come from Lago Cachet Dos.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic conductivity is the property to describe how water is moving through porous medium. It is related to the intrinsic permeability of the geological materials in two general groups: consolidated and unconsolidated materials. In general, groundwater is prone to flow through the porosity and fractures. In consolidated rocks, the flow channel is mostly defined by the fractures, such as fault zones, joints and etc. By contrast, the flow channel is defined by fractures as well as sediment porosity in the unconsolidated materials. In this study, we tested the hydraulic conductivity and its variations in the unconsolidated alluviums, which are cut through by thrusting of the Chihshang fault with a creeping rate of 2 cm/yr in eastern Taiwan.\nWe conducted injection tests with an array of six tiltmeters to measure the surface tilt during the experiments. The results of the hydraulic experiments exhibited a high heterogeneity of the aquifer hydro-mechanical responses and are in agreement with the existence of a lower permeable hanging wall and a higher permeable footwall. The surface tilt signals displayed a hydraulic gradient increasing toward the injection well particularly in the hanging wall. On other hand, no significant signal in the footwall, which means that the water flow slowly parallel through the fault zone and infiltrated quickly in the relative higher permeable footwall. We conclude that the fault plane, which dips at 40-50 degrees toward the hanging-wall side, plays a critical role as a barrier of water conduits.",

            "abstract": "Boron isotopes (δ11B) and boron/calcium ratios (B/Ca) in tests of planktic foraminifera are controlled by equilibrium reactions between boron and carbon species in seawater, and thus represent important proxies of past marine carbonate chemistry. Indeed, the recent application of these boron-based proxies to fossil shells of planktic foraminifera from cores spanning the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56Ma, an abrupt global warming and ocean acidification event) reveal a decline of ~0.3 in the pH of the mixed-layer [1], an anomaly that is well within the range of estimates based on the observed shoaling of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) [2, and references therein]. The PETM occurred superimposed on a long-term warming trend that initiated in the Late Paleocene and continued into the Early Eocene (LPEE; 53-59Ma). The magnitude of warming [3] and deepening of the CCD [4] indicate that the LPEE was driven by a rise in pCO2 nearly equivalent to that of the PETM [5].\nHere we extend the PETM record of boron-based proxies at IODP Site 1209 across the LPEE, in conjunction with stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in planktic foraminifera, in order to better constrain the long-term changes in pH and carbonate chemistry that accompanied the suggested rise in atmospheric CO2. The 20kyr resolution B/Ca record shows a long-term decline of ~25% during the LPEE, as well as subtle 400kyr cycles associated with eccentricity that mirror those observed in δ13C, and thus might reflect on changes in pH. The lower resolution δ11B record exhibits little change during the Late Paleocene before decreasing step-wise to lower values following the PETM, indicating that either pH in the upper ocean did not change significantly prior to the PETM, despite warming and inferred pCO2 increase, or changes in δ11Bseawater compensated for pH driven changes. As verification of these observations at Site 1209, complementary B/Ca and δ11B records are being generated for Atlantic IODP Sites 1262 and 1263.\n[1] Penman et al. 2014.

            "abstract": "Over 2/3 of the global hydrothermal heat flux occurs at low temperatures (< 150°) on the ridge flanks carried by fluid volumes comparable to riverine discharge. Understanding ridge flank hydrothermal exchange is important to quantify global geochemical cycles. Hydrothermal chemical pathways are complex and the effects of water-rock reactions remain poorly constrained. Factors controlling fluid flow include volcanic structure, sediment thickness, and basement topography. This study compares the effects of low temperature alteration in two locations with contrasting hydrogeological regimes.\nThe intermediate spreading Juan de Fuca ridge flank (JdF) in the northeast Pacific sports a thick sediment blanket. Rare basement outcrops are sites of fluid recharge and discharge. The average alteration extent (~10% secondary minerals), oxidation ratio (Fe3+/FeTOT=34%), and alteration character (orange, green, grey halos) of basement is constant with crustal age and depth along a 0.97–3.6 m.yr transect of ODP basement holes. However, vesicle fills record an increasingly complex history of successive alteration with age.\nIn contrast, North Pond, a ~8 m.yr-old sediment-filled basin at 22N on the slow spreading Mid Atlantic Ridge, hosts rapid, relatively cool SE to NW basinal fluid flow. Average alteration extent (~10%) and oxidation ratio (33%) of Hole 395A basalts are similar to JdF. However, 395A cores are dominated by orange alteration halos, lack celadonite, but have abundant zeolite. Vesicle fill combinations are highly variable, but the most common fill progression is from oxidising to less oxidising secondary assemblages.\nThe comparable extent of alteration between these two sites and the absence of an age relationship on the JdF suggests that the alteration extent of the upper crust is uniform and mostly established by 1 Myr. However, the variable alteration character reflects the influence of regional hydrology on hydrothermal alteration.",

In addition, measuring englacial and subglacial propserties is critical for oceanographic studies (circulation beneath ice shelvs), paleoclimate studies (mapping internal reflecting horizons; measuring the thickness and properties of subglacial sediments), biological studies (estimating the potential for conditions conducive to harboring lifeforms), and many other applications. Some of these properties are relatively stable over time and space, and some can change rapidly. For example, ice shelf basal melt is on the order of meters per year; sediment erosion and deposition varies from nil to meters per year.\nTechniques for measuring these properties are many and varied. Here we focus on radar and seismic methods, with emphasis on high-resolution measurements of the bed. We made radar measurements over multiple sites on Whilllans Ice Stream, Kamb Ice Strea, and the Ross Ice Shelf to compare and contrast bed conditions. These measurements were repeated after a two- and four-week interval to monitor change. The radar system used was a broad band multichannel array system optimized for high spatial resolution. Bed reflection phase is compared to internal-horizon phase to estimate change in bed properties. Work was conducted (and repeated) along long traverse lines allowing for measuring spatial and temporal variations in changes in bed conditions.",

Their dynamic spectral feature can be potentially used to diagnose important parameters of the reconnection site such as plasma density and spatial size of the fragmentation. Yet direct observational evidence supporting this scenario has been elusive mainly due to the lack of imaging observations. The upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) provides the first opportunity of performing simultaneous radio imaging and dynamic spectroscopy, which allows radio sources to be imaged at every spatio-temporal pixel in the dynamic spectrum. Here we report Jansky VLA observations of decimetric spike bursts recorded during an eruptive solar limb flare. Combined with EUV and X-ray data from SDO and RHESSI, we show that the spike bursts coincide spatially with a loop-top hard X-ray source, which are located in a region where supra-arcade downflows meet the underlying hot, EUV/X-ray loops. We interpret the observed spike bursts as a direct signature of non-thermal electrons accelerated by turbulences and/or shocks in the reconnection outflow region.",

These include 3m and 6m vibrocoring systems; a 5m combined rockdrill and vibrocorer system; an oriented drill designed specifically to recover samples for use in palaeomagnetic studies; and a 55m rockdrill (RockDrill2).\nRecently, BGS have developed an autonomous, battery-operated vibrocoring system compatible with both the 3m and 6m vibrocorers, which can be used in water depths up to 6000m. Use of a battery system negates the use of an umbilical power cable to operate the vibrocorer, which instead can be deployed using the vessels A-frame and winch. The autonomous battery system comprises six 48V 19Ah batteries connected in series to give a 288V power source, a microprocessor and real-time clock. Data from the sensors are recorded with a time-stamp, giving diagnostic information that can be downloaded once the system is returned to the deck. The vibrocorer is operated via a pre-set program which is set up before deployment.\nThe new system not only allows vibrocoring in greater water depths, but can also be used on smaller vessels where deck space is limited as a separate winch and umbilical is not required. The autonomous system was used for the first time in June 2014 on-board the R\\V Belgica to acquire samples from 20 sites in the Dangeard and Explorer canyon heads, off the southwest of England in 430m water depth.\nAnother development is the BGS 55m rockdrill (RockDrill2),  a remotely operated sampling system capable of coring up to 55m below sea floor in water depths up to  4000m. The rockdrill can be operated via its own launch and recovery system and can be outfitted with additional sensors such as gas flow meters, which have been designed by the BGS for assessing volume of gas hydrate, and down-hole logging tools.\nThe 55m rockdrill has recently been used to sample hydrate-entrained sediments in the Sea of Japan.  The maximum coring depth achieved was 32m below sea floor and the system can operate for more than 50 hours on a single deployment. The BGS system will be used in conjunction with the Bremen University (MARUM) MeBo sea-floor rockdrill on future International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions.",

            "abstract": "Foraminiferal biofacies, P/B ratios, grain size, physical properties and downhole log records spanning the early to Middle Eocene (54-41 Ma) from the South Tasman Rise ODP Leg 189 Site 1171 provides evidence that the commencement of surface water flow through the Tasman Seaway occurred at ~51.9 Ma. Seven foraminiferal biofacies were identified and planktonic/ benthic (P/B) foraminiferal ratios were calculated to estimate water-depth changes and evaluate paleoceanographic conditions. The biofacies are characterized by a change from exclusively agglutinated to more calcareous forms, with the transition starting at 51.9 Ma. Foraminiferal abundances, nannofossil and CaCO3 content are low for the interval between 54.0-51.5 Ma. Above 51 Ma, calcareous foraminifers, such as Dentalina, Nodosaria, Lenticulina, Cibicides, Elphidium, and Bulimina spp. become abundant within many intervals as well as a long-term increase in nanofossil and CaCO3 content occurs. Higher P/B ratios occur in samples < 51 Ma although they vary throughout the early and middle Eocene.\nOur data indicate a gradual change from: 1) shallow, poorly ventilated waters before 51.9 Ma; 2) slightly deeper and better ventilated waters occurred between 51.9 and 49.0 Ma; and 3) a transition from inner and middle/ outer neritic environments, with generally better ventilated conditions after 49.0 Ma. This is concomitant with a change in sedimentation rates from 164 m/myr between 52.7 and 51.7 Ma to 18 m/myr at 41.0 Ma. As shallow-water depths occur throughout this section, sedimentation rates from Site 1171 can be used as a proxy for subsidence for the eastern side of the nascent Tasman Seaway. Taken together these data suggest an early episode of high subsidence (e.g., possible crustal thinning) occurred between 52.7 and 51.7 Ma, with final rifting resulting in deep-water flow starting during the Late Eocene to earliest Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "Records of geochemical cycling of bio-essential, redox-sensitive elements have keys to decipher mysteries of the co-evolution of Earth and life. To obtain insight into biogeochemical cycling of those elements and early evolution of microbial biosphere from high-quality samples, we drilled through Mesoarchean strata in coastal Pilbara (Dixon Island-Cleaverville Drilling Project, see Yamaguchi et al., 2009; Kiyokawa et al., 2012), and obtained 3.2 Ga old drillcores (CL1, CL2, and DX) of sulfide-rich black shales in the Cleaverville Group, Pilbara Supergroup. We conducted a systematic geochemical study involving sequential extractions of Fe, S, C, and N for phase-dependent contents (e.g., pyrite-Fe, reactive-Fe, highly reactive-Fe, unreactive-Fe, pyrite-S, sulfate-S, organic-S, elemental-S, Corg, Ccarb, Norg, and Nclay) and their stable isotope compositions, micro FT-IR and laser Raman spectroscopy for extracted kerogen, in addition to major and trace (redox-sensitive; e.g., Mo) element analysis, for >100 samples. Here we integrate our recent multidisciplinary investigations into the redox state of ocean and nature of microbial biosphere in the ocean 3.2 Ga ago. All of the obtained data are very difficult to explain only by geochemical processes in strictly anoxic environments, where both atmosphere and oceans were completely anoxic, like an environment before the inferred “Great Oxidation Event” when pO2 was lower than 0.00001 PAL (e.g., Holland, 1994). Our extensive data set consistently suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, bacterial sulfate reduction, and microbially mediated redox-cycling of nitrogen, possibly involving denitrification and N2-fixation, are very likely to have been operating, and may be used as a strong evidence for at least local and temporal existence of oxidized environment as far back as 3.2 Ga ago. Modern-style biogeochemical cycling of Fe, S, C, N, and Mo has been operating since then. The atmosphere-hydrosphere system 3.2 Ga ago would have been sufficiently oxidized to allow redox-cycling of elements during deposition of the sediments, ~800 Ma earlier than commonly thought. Our suggestions have far-reaching and astrobiological implications for earlier evolution of the surface environment, especially redox state, and marine microbial biosphere.",

            "abstract": "The impact of sea level rise (SLR) on hurricane storm surge and wind-waves is a non-linear process (Bilskie et al., 2014). Using a high-resolution physics-based numerical model, we examine shelf wave dynamics in general and a shelf anomaly in particular under global climate change scenarios, which include SLR and potential hurricane intensification. To begin it is noted that Hurricane Dennis (2005) produced local storm surge in Apalachee Bay of six to ten feet, but the National Hurricane Center advisory for the region forecast only four to six feet of storm surge. This forecast was based on the relatively weak wind forcing along the west Florida shelf, but the additional storm-induced surge was caused by a remotely forced shelf wave that propagated along the Florida shelf as a topographic Rossby wave (Morey et al.,2006).\nThese mesoscale processed are studied under climate change scenarios using a state-of-the-art wind-waved hurricane storm surge model (SWAN+ADCIRC) of the northern Gulf of Mexico that encompasses the off-shore regions including the western North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. The finitie element model penetrates the shoreline along Florida’s “Big Bend” region, the Florida panhandle, Alabama, and the Mississippi coast with high resolution that is sufficient to describe the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, for example. The large domain and fine mesh resolution included in the model permits the description, and non-linear interaction, of the physics associated with wind-generated waves and hurricane storm surge that produce storm-induced anomalies such as the Rossby wave generated during Hurricane Dennis. Examination of various wave statistics such as significant wave height, mean wave period and direction, and wave radiation stress gradients provide insight into future behavior of storm-induced shelf wave dynamics under global climate change scenarios. This study may impact future statistics and probability distributions for analysis of flood risk by including parameters for shelf wave dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon particles (BC) strongly absorb solar radiation and may be the second largest contributor to global warming after greenhouses gases. However, the magnitude of the climate forcing by BC is quite uncertain, with a global average value estimated up to + 1.1Wm2. There is limited long term BC field data that can be used to validate global models to estimate the radiative forcing. Here we report (1) the measurements of BC concentrations, [BC], on filters collected weekly over 47 years, from 1964 to 2010 at Kevo, Finland (69o 45' N, 27o 02' E), (2) the se-asonal and long term trends, (3) the relative impact of potential source regions of BC and (4) compare the [BC] with the values calculated by the OsloCTM3model that simulates BC transport and removal rates and emission inventories as input.\nBC Concentrations were determined in weekly aerosol samples collected on Whatman 42 or Glass fiber filters using optical and/or thermal optical methods. The data so obtained provides the longest record of BC measurements. The highest annual mean concentrations were observed in 1965-1966, 670ng m-3 (local wood burning may have contributed at that time). Concentrations decreased sharply, averaging ~300 ng m-3 during 1967-80, ~250 ng m-3 for 1981- 90, ~140 for 1991-2000, and ~100 ng m-3 for 2001-10. From 1970 to 2010 the concentration decreased by 78% or 1.8% per yr. The highest concentrations were observed in winter, and the lowest in summer. Model calculations using the OsloCTM3 yield BC values ~4 times lower than those observed between 1998 and 2008, however the time-trend is reproduced quite faithfully. The model underestimates BC for the earlier periods as well. There are limitations in global models to reproduce Arctic surface concentration, but the comparison of model and observations might also indicate that the emissions in source regions are underestimated. It can be used to improve historical emission inventories for the regions affecting the surface concentration in the European Arctic. Revised emission inventories will impact the radiative forcing trend calculations, including the snow albedo effect.",

Metropolitan Port-au-Prince and five cities in the North of Haiti including Cap-Haitien were included in this program.\nThe seismic microzonation is an important tool for the knowledge of the seismic risk. It is based on the collection of geological, geophysical and geotechnical data. It describes a specific class of soil associated with each type of soil. Its goal is to map the homogenous zones of soil to effects of site lithology, topographic site effects, liquefaction and ground movements.\nThis work is based on two aspects of the studies of microzoning for the city of Cap-Haïtien: effects of lithological site and Liquefaction.\nThe zoning of site effects is to identify and map the areas with consistent geological and geomechanical characteristics and homogeneous seismic response; the objective is to provide, in each zone, seismic movements adapted.\nFive classes of soil at site effects were distinguished. Associated responses spectra were obtained by a 1D nonlinear analysis using CyberQuake software (Modaressi et al. 1997 BRGM).\nThe zoning of the liquefaction present the liquefaction potential of different areas. Three levels of risk of liquefaction were found during this study that a large part of the city is strongly liquefiable.",

            "abstract": "The primary responsibility of the Hydrographic Department at the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) is to support US Navy surface and sub-surface Safety of Navigation (SoN) requirements. These requirements are interpreted, surveys are conducted, and accurate products are compiled and archived for future exploitation. For a number of years NAVOCEANO has employed a two-tiered data-basing structure to support SoN. The first tier (Data Warehouse, or DWH) provides access to the full-resolution sonar and lidar data. DWH preserves the original data such that any scale product can be built. The second tier (Digital Bathymetric Database – Variable resolution, or DBDB-V) served as the final archive for SoN chart scale, gridded products compiled from source bathymetry. DBDB-V has been incorporated into numerous DoD tactical decision aids and serves as the foundation bathymetry for ocean modeling. With the evolution of higher density survey systems and the addition of high-resolution gridded bathymetry product requirements, a two-tiered model did not provide an efficient solution for SoN. The two-tiered approach required scientists to exploit full-resolution data in order to build any higher resolution product. A new perspective on the archival and exploitation of source data was required. This new perspective has taken the form of a third tier, the Navigation Surface Database (NSDB). NSDB is an SQLite relational database populated with International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), S-102 compliant Bathymetric Attributed Grids (BAGs). BAGs archived within NSDB are developed at the highest resolution that the collection sensor system can support and contain nodal estimates for depth, uncertainty, separation values and metadata. Gridded surface analysis efforts culminate in the generation of the source resolution BAG files and their storage within NSDB. Exploitation of these resources eliminates the time and effort needed to re-grid and re-analyze native source file formats.",

            "abstract": "India is a hotspot for food security issues over the upcoming decades, due to increasing population pressures, groundwater depletion, and climate change. Investing in additional irrigation infrastructure may bolster food security, however, the relative influence of different types of irrigation (e.g. groundwater versus canal) on agricultural production remains unclear. One reason that the relative impact of different irrigation strategies on agricultural production has not been analyzed across India is because national-scale data on crop production and the types of irrigation technologies used are typically available at too coarse of spatial and temporal resolutions to answer this question adequately. Thus, we develop a novel algorithm to map cropped area across India at a 1 x 1 km scale using MODIS satellite data, and link these high-resolution cropped area maps with village-level data (n = 600,000) on irrigation. This allowed us to assess the relative impact of groundwater (i.e. dug, shallow, and deep wells) and canal irrigation (i.e. surface lift and flow canals) on winter cropped area and its sensitivity to rainfall across India at the village-scale from 2000 to 2006. We find that deep well irrigation is both associated with the greatest amount of winter cropped area, and is also the least sensitive to monsoon and winter rainfall variability. However, the effectiveness of deep well irrigation varies across India, with the greatest benefits seen in the regions that are most at risk for losing groundwater as a possible source of irrigation over the upcoming decades (e.g. Northwest India). This work highlights the need to develop ways to use remaining groundwater more efficiently (e.g. drip irrigation, less water-intensive crops) given that canal irrigation is not an adequate substitute, particularly in the regions that are facing the greatest levels of groundwater depletion.",

The conversion of bush to pastureland via burning in the Waipaoa and Waiapu watersheds increased erosion rates by an order of magnitude. Surface and bank erosion, coupled with landsliding and gullying deliver OC to the rivers. Visual observations, sediment budgets, C-isotope (12C, 13C, 14C) mass balances and biomarker analyses all indicate that the OC is a mixture of recent plant debris, charcoal, aged soil C (< 18 kyrs old) and Cretaceous – Neogene sedimentary rock-derived C. The vastly different ages of the OC pools might be expected to lead to different reactivities and fates in the seabed.\nNearshore wave-driven deposition-resuspension cycles winnow fines from sands in water depths ~<50 m. The sand-sized sedimentary OC is dominated by rock C. Younger fractions of soil C are transported primarily as fines to deeper water. Marine OC is added to the fine-grained sediments as they encounter zones of primary production.\nDissolved inorganic C (DIC) within the interstitial (pore) waters of the marine sediments is a mixture of seawater DIC and benthic respired C. The C-isotopic composition of the DIC reflects its source. Stable isotope and radiocarbon measurements indicate that contemporary terrestrial C3 plant OC oxidation dominates respiration on the Waiapu shelf nearshore (~60 m). Marine OC is preferentially oxidized at water depths >80 m. The rock-derived C does not seem to be oxidized on the shelf or upper slope.\nA comparison of riverine particulate organic C (POC) with shelf depocenter OC concentrations suggest the Waipaoa and Waiapu soil C burial efficiencies are ~50 and 85% respectively. This does not consider the fate of soil C dispersed beyond the depocenter where preservation efficiencies are expected to be lower because of greater exposure times to O2 at the sediment-water interface. Nevertheless, these small rivers are more efficient at the sequestration of soil C than some tropical counterparts (e.g. Amazon and Fly) in which extensive oxidation of the terrestrial OC has been documented.",

            "abstract": "In the past few decades terrestrial photogrammetry has become a widely used tool for glaciological research, brought about in part by the proliferation of high-quality, low-cost digital cameras, dramatic increases in image-processing power of computers, and very innovative progress in image processing, much of which has come from computer vision research and from the computer gaming industry. At present, glaciologists have developed their capacity to gather images much further than their ability to process them. Many researchers have accumulated vast inventories of imagery, but have no efficient means to extract the data they desire from them. In many cases these are single-image time series where the processing limitation lies in the paucity of methods to obtain 3-dimension object space information from measurements in the 2-dimensional image space; in other cases camera pairs have been operated but no automated means is in hand for conventional stereometric analysis of many thousands of image pairs. Often the processing task is further complicated by weak camera geometry or ground control distribution, either of which will compromise the quality of 3-dimensional object space solutions. Solutions exist for many of these problems, found sometimes among the latest computer vision results, and sometimes buried in decades-old pre-digital terrestrial photogrammetric literature. Other problems, particularly those arising from poorly constrained or underdetermined camera and ground control geometry, may be unsolvable. Small-scale, ground-based photography and photogrammetry of glaciers has grown over the past few decades in an organic and disorganized fashion, with much duplication of effort and little coordination or sharing of knowledge among researchers. Given the utility of terrestrial photogrammetry, its low cost (if properly developed and implemented), and the substantial value of the information to be had from it, some further effort to share knowledge and methods would be a great benefit for the community. We consider some of the main problems to be solved, and aspects of how optimal knowledge sharing might be accomplished.",

            "abstract": "Carbonatites are carbonate-rich and very fluid melts believed to form mainly from primary mantle melting. The mobility of these melts has attracted renewed interest as carbonatites are considered a major transport agent of carbon from the mantle to the crust and may be intimately linked to the generation of kimberlites.\nThe measurement of carbonatite viscosity is a priority in order to understand the carbonatite mobility and reaction rates. Obtaining accurate viscosity measurements of such low viscosity melts is however an experimental challenge due to volatility, very low torques and melt stability in the viscometer.\nWe present preliminary results of a rheological characterization study (Couette viscometry) on a series of very low viscosity natural melts and their analogues. Experiments have been performed using a Modular Compact Rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 502) equipped with 2 custom-made concentric-cylinder narrow gap geometries (steel and Pt-Au). The rheometer is characterized by an air-bearing-supported synchronous motor with torque ranging between 0.01 µNm and 230 mNm (resolution of 0.1 nNm).\nThe instrument has been calibrated in a temperature-viscosity-shear rate window comparable with carbonate melts. Initially, a certified silicone standard (980 and 39000 mPa sec in a temperature interval 100-25°C) at shear rate of 1 to 100 sec-1 has been used. Then the viscosity of distilled water (0.08 – 0.05 mPa sec) at 30 and 60°C has been measured between 30 and 70 sec-1. Finally, high temperature calibration measurements at 1000°C have been performed using a DGG standard glass.\nViscosity measurements on carbonate melts have been performed in the temperature range of 730-950°C. Measured values range between 3.4 and 15.2 mPa sec. Results show that in the investigated temperature range the melts exhibit, as expected, Newtonian viscosity. The results will be discussed in the context of all available data from the literature including high pressure determinations.",

            "abstract": "Himalayan range and Indo-Gangetic plain are drained by one of the world’s largest river system of the world: the Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers. This river system is the first in term of sediment transport and thus constitute an interesting region to establish a relation between erosion and climate. Sediments from the Bay of Bengal indicate that the strength of summer monsoon rainfall is an important factor driving weathering and erosion of the Himalaya.\nResults of a high-resolution clay mineralogy study combined with major elements geochemistry and oxygen isotopes stratigraphy are reported for a deep-sea piston core collected 300 km off the Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers estuary in the northern part of the Bay in Bengal. In this study, the top part (first 13.5 m) of Core MD12-3412 covers the last climatic cycle (last 180 kyr). This core reveals a monsoon-controlled chemical weathering and physical erosion history during the last 180 kyr in the Himalayan range and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin.\nData show the contribution of Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers, which drain the Himalayan range and the Indo-Gangetic plain. Clay mineral assemblages are dominated by illite and smectite, with lesser abundance of chlorite and kaolinite. Smectite/(illite + chlorite) and illite chemistry index are used as indices of chemical weathering rates. Thirty five new samples for εNd(0) analyses were selected (in turbidite and hemipelagic layers) during glacial and interglacial periods.\n Himalayan range is characterized by εNd(0) ≈ -16, whereas εNd(0) values along the Arakan coast are around -8. In this work we compared with εNd(0) values obtained previously on the free-carbonated fraction on Core MD77-180 which show that sediment from the eastern Bay of Bengal results from the mixing of material from the Himalayan and Indo–Burman ranges (with an average value of εNd(0) ≈ -13 for the last climatic cycle). These analyses give us information about the material coming from Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers system and Indo-Burman ranges and, in turn, on the Indian summer monsoon intensity.",

            "abstract": "Although urban areas contribute between 67-75% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is very little understanding of what drives anthropogenic emissions both locally and globally. Part of this gap in knowledge is due to a lack of reliable measurements across a range of urban scales. Where, when, and how much urban areas use energy is also a function of human activity patterns and social practices deeply embedded in culture. One apparent manifestation of energy use patterns in human settlements is in the celebration of holidays – when human activity patterns change, this affects short-term patterns in energy consumption. Using satellite-based retrievals of nighttime lighting (NTL) during three major holiday periods, (1) Christmas and New Year’s, (2) the Holy Month of Ramadan, and (3) the Chinese Spring Festival, we demonstrate that cultural variations within and between urban areas contextualize and shape the magnitude and timing of energy use. We derived NTL signatures from the Suomi-NPP satellite's (VIIRS) Day/Night Band for two years and over 1200 cities. The high-quality NTL retrievals are based on the latest science reprocessing (Collection V1.1, c. 8/2014) produced by the Land Product Evaluation and Analysis Tool Element (Land PEATE) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. After correcting for cloud and snow cover, as well as atmospheric-, terrain-, lunar BRDF-, fire-, and straylight effects, the high-resolution NTL time series were decomposed into seasonal, trend, and remainder signals—revealing strong, consistent patterns of activity changes during holiday periods. We demonstrate that patterns of holiday luminosity reveal changes in human activities important for understanding urban demographics and urban dynamics, and are strong examples of the socio-cultural and energy demand signatures embedded in satellite remote sensing imagery.",

            "abstract": "Representations of light in models of tropical forests are typically unconstrained by field data and rife with assumptions, and for good reason: forest light environments are highly variable, difficult and onerous to predict, and the value of improved prediction is unclear. Still, the question remains: how detailed must our models be to be accurate enough, yet simple enough to be able to scale them from plots to landscapes? Here we use field data to constrain 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D light models and integrate them with simple forest models to predict net primary production (NPP) across an Andes-to-Amazon elevation transect in Peru. Field data consist of novel vertical light profile measurements coupled with airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory. Preliminary results indicate that while 1-D models may be “good-enough” and highly-scalable where forest structure is relatively homogenous, more complex models become important as forest structure becomes more heterogeneous. We discuss the implications our results hold for prediction of NPP under a changing climate, and suggest paths forward for useful proxies of light availability in forests to improve and scale up forest models.",

Based on the equilibrium P concentrations at the sediment-water interface, surface sediments behave as a source of P to the water column. A seven-day continuous drainage event exported 4.7 to 11.1 metric tons of suspended solids per farm, corresponding to 32 to 63 kg of particulate P being lost to downstream ecosystems.

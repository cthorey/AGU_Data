            "abstract": "Mineral dust aerosol constitutes a large fraction of the total aerosol burden, which presents health risks, alters atmospheric chemistry, and strongly perturbs the radiative balance over large regions. Therefore, it is imperative that we understand what controls the observed trends and changes in variability of dust emissions. Recently, we have shown that the observed reduction in African dust loading over the Atlantic in recent decades is likely driven by large-scale wind changes over source regions rather than changes in vegetation cover. Using an updated dust emission scheme and information from high resolution (0.25 degree) simulations from the NASA GEOS model, we attribute the uncertainty in modeled dust AOD and expand the analysis to other regions of the world, including Asia and the Middle East.",

            "abstract": "Depending on initial melt composition, magma volumes, transfer rates, depth of emplacement and tectonic conditions, granite magmas can follow different crystallization paths leading to complex patterns of magmatic fluid/heat release and water-rock interaction in the host rocks at the emplacement level. In the case of multi-pulse magmatic complexes, several contact metamorphic and hydrothermal effects can overlap through time on a relatively small crustal portion. The net result of the described complex evolution is a magmatic system, where magmatic fluid exsolution, heat flow and triggering of meteoric fluid convection cells follow cyclically transient patterns with strong implication on ore forming processes and geothermal field lifespan.\nDetailed field mapping, coupled with petrographic-geochronologic-geochemical-isotopic data on Late Miocene-Pleistocene granite intrusions in Tuscany provided new insights on melting processes occurred in the roots as well as on paleo-hydrothermal circuits triggered at the roof of the intrusive complexes. Tuscan granite intrusions were constructed incrementally by amalgamation (sheeted plutons) and/or multilayer dispersion (sills and laccoliths) of different magma pulses, sequentially produced as the Apennine fold belt was progressively thinned, heated and intruded by mafic magmas. Partial melting was probably triggered by multiple, small-sized mafic intrusions, that allowed temporary overstepping of dehydration melting reactions into the already pre-heated crust. Dilution in time of the magmatic activity prevented melt homogenization at depth, allowing the formation at the emplacement level of multiple, isotopically distinct, intrusive sheets instead of a single, homogeneous, hybrid pluton.\nThis could be also one of the major key factors explaining the prolonged hydrothermal activity recorded in this area by both fossil (Plio-Pleistocene ore deposits) and active (Larderello geothermal field) systems.",

            "abstract": "The crystallization rate of zircon in a cooling magma depends on the cooling rate through the saturation interval in addition to compositional and kinetic factors. Repeated influx of hot magma over 10-20 ka leads to short-amplitude temperature oscillations, which are recorded by resorption/crystallization cycles of zircon. Plotting the number of dated zircons versus their high-precision U-Pb date results in curves that qualitatively relate to the evolution of magma temperature over time [1], [2].\nThe trace elemental, O and Hf isotopic composition of zircon gives indications about the degree of magma homogenization and thermal evolution. Zircons from systems with small volumes and magma fluxes record non-systematic chemical and Hf isotopic heterogeneity, suggesting crystallization in non-homogenized ephemeral magma batches. Such systems typically lead to small, mid-upper crustal plutons [3].\nZircons from large-volume crystal-poor rhyolites record initial heterogeneities and rapid amalgamation of smaller magma batches over 10 ka [4], while zircons from monotonous intermediates record magma evolution over several 100 ka with coherent fractionation trends suggesting homogenization and a coherent thermal evolution [2]. In both cases, volumes and flux rates were sufficient to produce large volumes of eruptible magma on very contrasting time scales.\nZircon is therefore recording cyclic crystallization-rejuvenation processes during temperature fluctuations in intermediate to upper crustal magma reservoirs but may not relate to the physical pluton emplacement or eruption. We can quantify volumes, rates of magma influx, rates of cooling and crystallization, and the degree of convective homogenization from zircon data, and infer reservoir assembly and eruption trigger mechanisms.\nThese parameters largely control the evolution of long-lived, low-flux silicic magmatic system typical for mid-to-upper crustal plutons, monotonous intermediates are characterized by intermediate durations and fluxes while short-lived, high-flux systems preferentially produce crystal-poor rhyolites.\n",

            "abstract": "There is great potential for reconstructing past changes in the hydrologic cycle using the hydrogen isotopic composition of plant-wax biomarkers. However, empirical relationships relating plant-wax hydrogen isotope compositions (δDwax) to source water are almost exclusively based upon modern plants, soils and sediments and a single compound class such as n-alkanes or n-alkanoic acids. Relatively little is known about the relationship between these compound classes and differences in how they record the hydrogen isotopic composition of source water. Here we present new hydrogen isotopic measurements from a suite of modern and late Quaternary lake sediment samples to test the fidelity of δDwaxto source water δD in space and time.\nWe find that within compound class the shared variance between C29 and C31 n-alkane and C28 and C30 n-alkanoic acid δD values is 87% and 86%. Between compound classes there is 53% shared variance between C29 n-alkane and C28 n-acid δD values. The apparent isotopic fractionation between source water and n-alkane δD values is consistent with prior studies from these regions that show the influence of vegetation type and climate. However, the n-alkanoic acid apparent fractionation values cannot be explained by these factors alone. Rather, the data require that for a large proportion of the samples there is a substantial contribution of long-chain n-acids from vegetation that uses lake water as the hydrogen source for lipid synthesis. This is consistent with overlapping n-acid compound distributions in lake sediment, soils, and aquatic and terrestrial plants from many of these regions.\nOur results emphasize the utility of plant-wax δD for reconstructing water δD values and highlight the potential importance of non-terrestrial sources of long-chain n-acids in lake systems.",

            "abstract": "We study the injection and subsequent evolution of a water sill into an ice shell overlying an ocean and examine the resulting successive surface deformations. We assume that water spreads within the elastic part of the ice shell and show that the mechanical properties of ice exert a strong control on the lateral extent of the sill. At shallow depths, water makes room for itself by lifting the overlying ice layer and water weight promotes lateral spreading of the sill. In contrast, a deep sill bends the underlying elastic layer and its weight does not affect its spreading. As a result, the sill lateral extent is limited to about a few to a few tens of kilometers by the fracture toughness of ice. In that case, the sill can thicken substantially, until the feeder dyke closes, since downward flexure of the lower elastic layer provides a way of keeping the pressure high in the water source.\nPits, domes, and small chaos on Europa’s surface are quasi-circular features a few to a few tens of kilometers in diameter whose morphology could be explained by the subsequent evolution of such a thick sill. Indeed, cooling of the sill after emplacement warms the surrounding ice and thins the overlying elastic ice layer. As a result, preexisting stresses in the elastic part of the ice shell increase locally to the point that they may disrupt the ice above the sill (small chaos). Furthermore, disruption of the surface also allows for partial isostatic compensation of water weight, leading to a topographic depression at the surface (pit), of the order of ~102 m. Finally, complete water solidification causes expansion of the initial sill volume and results in an uplifted topography (dome) of ~102 m.",

            "abstract": "Mountains are a widespread terrestrial feature, covering from 12 to 24 percent of the world’s terrestrial surface, depending of the definition. Topographic relief is central to the definition of mountains, to the benefits and costs accruing to society and to the cascade of changes expected from climate change. Mountains capture and store water, particularly important in arid regions and in all areas for energy production. In temperate and boreal regions, mountains have a great range in population densities, from empty to urban, while tropical mountains are often densely settled and farmed. Mountain regions contain a wide range of habitats, important for biodiversity, and for primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy. Climate change interacts with this relief and consequent diversity. Elevation itself may accentuate warming (elevationi dependent warming) in some mountain regions. Even average warming starts complex chains of causality that reverberate through the diverse social ecological mountain systems affecting both the highlands and adjacent lowlands. A single feature of climate change such as higher snow lines affect the climate through albedo, the water cycle through changes in timing of release , water quality through the weathering of newly exposed material, geomorphology through enhanced erosion, plant communities through changes in climatic water balance, and animal and human communities through changes in habitat conditions and resource availabilities. Understanding these causal changes presents a particular interdisciplinary challenge to researchers, from assessing the existence and magnitude of elevation dependent warming and monitoring the full suite of changes within the social ecological system to climate change, to understanding how social ecological systems respond through individual and institutional behavior with repercussions on the long-term sustainability of these systems.",

Penetrating from the bow shock through the magnetosheath, they can locally distort the magnetopause upon impact, generating both magnetopause surface waves and/or inner-magnetospheric compressional waves. As such, the effects of the jets have been seen in the magnetosphere all the way to the ground.\nHere we review the recent progress in studying these jets that can couple bow shock and magnetopause dynamics. Large statistical datasets of in situ observations have revealed the HSJ occurrence rates and properties. Most importantly, HSJs are found more often downstream of the quasi-parallel shock, and thus occur on the dayside predominantly during intervals of quasi-radial interplanetary magnetic field. Combining the observational datasets with modeling and large scale kinetic simulations has made it possible to systematically address their formation. The main source of HSJs is not solar wind discontinuities. Instead, mounting evidence points to ripples on the bow shock itself, induced by large scale foreshock processes. Thanks to this joint effort we are moving towards comprehensive understanding of the formation, properties and dynamics of the jets as well as their effects.",

            "abstract": "Tropical biomass burning (BB) emissions are a major global source of particulate matter (PM). However, high temporal and spatial variability in the emissions lead to major challenges for their quantification and representation in models. Previous modelling studies have found a persistent underestimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed in BB regions, requiring fire emissions of PM to be scaled by a factor of ~2-5 to match observations. Here we evaluate a global aerosol microphysics model (GLOMAP) against long-term in-situ observations of PM and black carbon in Amazonia and SE Asia, in addition to AOD, to better understand tropical BB aerosol and improve estimates of the impact of BB on air quality and climate.\nWe performed simulations with GLOMAP for the period 1997–2012 using three different BB emission inventories: GFED3, GFASv1.0 and FINNv1. We find that in N.E. Brazil the model with GFED emissions is unable to capture the magnitude and seasonal variability in observed PM (R2=0.3, bias = -44%), even when emissions are scaled up by a factor of 3.4 (R2=0.3, bias = -26%). This is likely due to an omission of small fires in the GFED3 emissions. Agreement between model and observations in this location is improved by using an active fire based emission inventory (e.g. FINN, R2=0.6, bias = -7%), which better captures emissions from small-scale agricultural fires.\nComparisons with all collected observations in SE Asia and Amazonia show that the model captures the inter-annual and seasonal cycles of monthly mean PM (mean R2 GFED, 0.6; GFAS, 0.7; FINN, 0.6) and AERONET AOD (mean R2 GFED, 0.6; GFAS, 0.7; FINN, 0.8) reasonably well. However, the model is generally negatively biased for both PM and AOD, the smallest bias being with the FINN emission inventory. By scaling FINN emissions up by 50% (much less than found from previous studies using only AOD), we find that we can adequately capture the magnitude of dry season PM across Amazonia and AOD in SE Asia. To capture the magnitude of AOD in Amazonia an additional scaling factor may need to be applied to FINN emissions injected above the surface. To evaluate the vertical profile of modelled BB aerosol we use aircraft observations from the SAMBBA field campaign. Overall, our results could have important implications for quantifying the air quality and climate effects of BB aerosol.",

I will review the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 at the surface. DISCOVER-AQ in Baltimore, the San Joaquin Valley, Houston and Denver revealed quite different conditions for determining this relationship. In each case, the surface reflectivity made determination of aerosol optical depth challenging, but upward looking columns of aerosol optical depth from sunphotometers provided confirmation of the AOD results from space. In Baltimore, AOD fields reflected PM2.5 concentrations well. In California, however, the low boundary layer heights and dominance of nitrate and organic aerosols made the AOD fields less predictive of PM2.5. In California and Colorado, hydration of the aerosol varied dramatically with aerosol type (especially smoke and dust) and revealed that without an understanding of the degree of aerosol hydration with aerosol composition, the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 will continue to be a challenge. Model predictions in the Baltimore-Washington study are relatively disappointing in helping define the needed physics between the optical and microphysical properties.

            "abstract": "Northern California’s Sierra Nevada and Shasta-Trinity mountains are key to the state’s water supply and can contribute to major floods in the Central Valley (CV). NOAA’s Hydrometeorology Testbed (HMT) program and the CalWater experiment have discovered much about how landfalling atmospheric rivers (AR) and Sierra Barrier Jets (SBJ) modulate orographic precipitation in that region. This presentation provides a review of recent findings, both from case-study and compositing perspectives. Wind-profiler and global-positioning-system (GPS) observations are used with soil moisture probes, stream gauges, and a regional reanalysis dataset. Key results include: Inland-directed ARs override a ~1-km-deep, Sierra-parallel SBJ located above the CV and the western slope of the Sierra. Above the developing SBJ, strengthening southwesterly flow marks the AR. The moistening SBJ reaches maximum intensity during the strongest AR flow aloft, at which time the core of the AR-parallel vapor transport slopes over the SBJ and intersects the Sierra. The SBJ then weakens with the initial cold-frontal passage aloft. A statistical analysis of orographic forcing reveals that both the AR and SBJ are crucial in determining the distribution of precipitation in the northern Sierra and Shasta-Trinity regions due to orographic precipitation enhancement. An open question remains regarding the transport of water vapor near the northern end of the CV. Namely, a portion of the AR-modulated SBJ flow may be transported through a prominent gap in the terrain between Mt. Lassen and Mt. Shasta, near the town of Burney. Recent analyses indicate that this gap allows AR water vapor to penetrate into the western interior (e.g., to Idaho) and thus contribute to heavy precipitation events far inland. The CalWater-2 program of field campaigns has identified diagnosis of the transport through this gap and its impact on northern California precipitation as a priority for future data collection and analysis.",

Diagnosing the precipitation process rates from remote sensing data require, at a minimum, some simultaneous information on the properties of the cloud droplet and precipitation droplet modes. The remote sensors on the A-Train provide the most comprehensive global measurements of warm marine cumulus. We wish to address in this paper whether and under what conditions sufficient simultaneous information is present in the A-Train measurements to diagnose the precipitation processes of auto conversion and accretion. In particular we will attempt to combine radar reflectivity measured by cloudsat, microwave brightness temperature derived from cloudsat data, and two MODIS reflectance channels.

In recent years the role of atmospheric rivers (ARs), narrow regions of intense water vapor transport in the lower troposphere, in mid-latitude flooding has been highlighted. The aim of this study is to (1) show the connection between ARs and extreme European precipitation and floods, and (2) discuss future changes to ARs under projected climate change.\nThe research presented uses satellite and atmospheric reanalysis data, daily observed precipitation and river flows, and climate change projections from five models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive. The results presented will show the strong link between ARs and heavy precipitation and floods in Europe, and will highlight how ARs are projected to change in the future. In particular the five CMIP5 models assessed show an approximate doubling of winter ARs affecting the UK in the period 2073-2099 compared to 1979-2005; this is likely to result in an increased risk of flooding in the future. Finally, an assessment of the predictability of an AR-type diagnostic using output from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction system will be covered.",

            "abstract": "The Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogeny (THO) was a Himalayan-style collision that marked an important stage of assembly of the Canadian Shield. Today, the THO is largely concealed beneath the Hudson Bay intracratonic basin. Regional seismic tomography shows a thick, high-wavespeed cratonic keel beneath the region, but also includes significant local heterogeneity that may be associated with the imprint of the THO, providing clues to Precambrian plate-tectonic processes.\nIn this study, we use multi-observable probabilistic inversions to investigate the thermal and compositional state of the Hudson Bay lithosphere, to explain the seismic wavespeed variations and to constrain in more detail potential signatures of the oldest cratonic cores and the THO collision. Rayleigh wave dispersion curves, surface heatflow, geoid anomalies and topography are jointly inverted to give a pseudo-3D model of the upper mantle beneath the region.\nLow temperatures are pervasive across the region, leading to a thick thermal lithosphere whose base lies at depths of 250 km or greater. The data are best explained by stratification of the lithosphere into (at least) two layers, with the top layer extremely depleted and the bottom layer generally more fertile, though still depleted with respect to the sublithospheric mantle. Across the Bay and Hudson Strait, a narrow zone of lowered depletion is observed in the top layer. The position of this anomaly coincides geographically with the THO and with the wavespeed reduction noted in previous seismic studies. It is likely that this feature represents juvenile material trapped between the cratonic cores in the final stages of the THO.\nWe also find evidence for anomalous mid-lithospheric compositions in certain areas, notably west of Hudson Bay. Additionally, some of the long-period surface wave data requires lower than average seismic wavespeeds below the lithosphere, suggesting localised regions of higher temperature/attenuation in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Parameter estimation–inferring parameter information through history matching and inverse methods–is often the only tenable way to populate properties in a large-scale regional model. In a Bayesian sense, the properties estimated in this way, and later used to make predictions, are conditional upon the data used to calibrate the model and all the assumptions made in the underlying model. This can result in a disconnect between parameters estimated at the laboratory, aquifer-test, and model scales. Additionally, more types of data–each with a different support volumes and level of information–are becoming available with more near-surface geophysical measurements being made on a regional scale. To take advantage of these data, a combination of flexible parameterization through distributed parameters, regularization, and weighting of various observation types can lead to defensible and useful results.\nThe USGS Groundwater Resources Program uses regional models and data assimilation to analyze and predict water availability in major regional aquifer systems in the United States. The inverse modeling process applied in several of these projects provides valuable lessons on the meaning of parameters at the large scale. Inverse modeling is used to estimate model parameters but—more importantly—to improve understanding of the conceptual framework the models are built on.",

            "abstract": "Recent megathrust earthquakes illustrated both their disastrous human and economic impact and our limited physical understanding of their spatial and temporal occurrence. To improve long-term seismic hazard assessment by overcoming the restricted direct observations in both time and space, we developed the new numerical seismo-thermo-mechanical (STM) model presented here.\nThis 2D continuum-mechanics based, viscoelastoplastic model uses an Eulerian-Lagrangian finite difference framework with similar on- and off-fault physics. This typically long-term geodynamic approach is extended to study short-term seismogenesis through a local invariant implementation of strongly slip rate-dependent friction. This approach may help to shed light onto the interaction between long-term subduction dynamics and deformation and associated short-term seismicity. Additional advantages of this STM approach include the physically consistent emergence of rupture paths, both on- and off-megathrust, and the inclusion of three key ingredients for seismic cycling --rate-dependent friction, slow tectonic loading, and visco-elastic relaxation--.\nThe validation of this approach is accomplished through a comparison with an analogue seismic cycle model (van Dinther et al., JGR, 2013a). The applicability, potential, and limitations were further illustrated in a more realistic geometry and physical setup of the Southern Chilean margin (van Dinther et al., JGR, 2013b). Extending these rapid transient slip cycles over time-scales of tens of thousands of years showed that ~5% of cyclic deformation is not recovered and is instead stored as permanent, anelastic deformation within the wedge. Analyzing off-megathrust events specifically showed they influence the megathrust cycle distinctly, while, especially steeply dipping outerrise events, also also increase the tsunami hazard significantly (van Dinther et al., GRL, 2014).\nThe innovative character of this seismo-thermo-mechanical approach opens a world of interdisciplinary research between geodynamics and seismology. To illustrate this approaches perspectives we will give examples illustrating the role of downdip seismogenic zone width for super cycles and the role of a weak viscous lower crust for surface displacements and a secondary zone of uplift.",

            "abstract": "The ocean and the atmosphere, and hence the climate, are governed by multi-scale interactions between turbulent eddies and waves. Turbulence in the presence of such waves proves to be richer and more complex than for homogeneous isotropic (HIT) flows, both for fluids and in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). Several examples will be reviewed in this talk and some cases will be illustrated with concepts using phenomenology, and with results stemming from recent high-resolution direct numerical simulations using the Navier-Stokes or Boussinesq equations. The role of anisotropy will be emphasized, and the context is that of geophysical or astrophysical fluid dynamics.\nFor example, turbulence has been shown to display strong intermittency, with fat wings in the probability distribution function (PDF) of the vertical velocity for stratified flows, when for HIT the PDFs of the velocity are Gaussian. This takes place in the so-called saturated regime where a balance between nonlinearities and waves occur. These localized patches of turbulence lead to enhanced mixing in the atmosphere and the ocean, and such a bursty behavior has also been observed in the planetary boundary layer and in the stratosphere.\nFurthermore, helicity (velocity-vorticity correlation), which is an ideal invariant in HIT, can be generated in rotating stratified flows in which it can lead to the creation of large-scale magnetic fields. Helicity is also used as an indicator of hurricane activity, and it develops at river confluences, inducing mixing and erosion.\nFinally, turbulence allows for an inverse cascade of energy to large scales, and a direct cascade to small scales, either of enstrophy in quasi-two-dimensional fluids, or of helicity in three dimensions, because of the anisotropy which is imposed by the boundaries or due to external agents. It has also been shown to lead to a dual transfer of energy to both large and small scales, each with a constant flux, e.g. for rotating stratified flows, reinforcing large-scale geostrophic balance and small-scale transport and dissipation. This dual cascade, which is also observed in MHD, can be justified on the basis of statistical mechanics of simplified truncated systems and thus it can be seen as corresponding to a broad class of nonlinear phenomena.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys magmatic system, Antarctica, forms part of the Ferrar dolerite Large Igneous Province. Comprising a vertical stack of interconnected sills, the complex provides a world-class example of pervasive lateral magma flow on a continental scale. The lowermost intrusion (Basement Sill) offers detailed sections through the now frozen particle macrostructure of a congested magma slurry1. Image-based numerical modelling where the intrusion geometry defines its own unique finite element mesh allows simulations of the flow regime to be made that incorporate realistic magma particle size and flow geometries obtained directly from field measurements. One testable outcome relates to the origin of rhythmic layering where analytical results imply the sheared suspension intersects the phase space for particle Reynolds and Peclet number flow characteristic of macroscopic structures formation2. Another relates to potentially novel crystal-liquid segregation due to the formation of eddies locally at undulating contacts at the floor and roof of the intrusion. The eddies are transient and mechanical in origin, unrelated to well-known fluid dynamical effects around obstacles where flow is turbulent. Numerical particle tracing reveals that these low Re number eddies can both trap (remove) and eject particles back into the magma at a later time according to their mass density. This trapping mechanism has potential to develop local variations in structure (layering) and magma chemistry that may otherwise not occur where the contact between magma and country rock is linear. Simulations indicate that eddy formation is best developed where magma viscosity is in the range 1-102 Pa s. Higher viscosities (> 103 Pa s) tend to dampen the effect implying eddy development is most likely a transient feature. However, it is nice to think that something as simple as a bumpy contact could impart physical and by implication chemical diversity in igneous rocks.\n1Marsh, D.B.

            "abstract": "Volcanic passive margins (VPMs) are distinctive features of Larges Igneous Provinces. They characterize continental breakup associated with the extrusion and intrusion of large volumes of magma, predominantly mafic. In Large Igneous Provinces, regional fissural volcanism predates localized syn-magmatic break-up of the lithosphere, suggesting that mantle melting is a cause of continental break-up, not a consequence. Early melt covers as volcanic traps large cratonic or/and cratonic-edge continental areas. Crustal dilatation through dyking in the upper crust and magma underplating at Moho level is thought to occur massively during this early stage. Lithosphere extension leading to break-up and VPMs development is coeval with a 3D focusing of mantle melting, giving rise to VPMs.\nFrom a combination of deep seismic reflection profiles and onshore observations, we show that the mechanism of continental breakup at volcanic passive margins is very different from the one generally proposed for non-magmatic systems. Crustal extension and coeval extrusion of thick wedges of seaward-dipping basalts are accommodated by continentward-dipping detachment-faults at both conjugate margins. Those faults root on a deformed ductile crust whose composition seems partly magmatic.\nOur numerical modeling show that hardening of deep continental crust during the early magmatic stages provokes a divergent flow of the ductile lithosphere (mantle and lower crust) away from a central continental block which thins through advection with time. Magma-assisted crustal-scale faults dipping continentward root over this flowing material, isolating micro-continents which may be lost in the future oceanic domain.\nThe structure and tectonic evolution of volcanic passive margins cannot therefore be compared to non-volcanic ones, where major detachment faults dip oceanward during the necking-stage and where mantle is finally exhumed during the mechanical breakup. Confusions may exist where ancient hyper-extended rift systems parallel VPMs. In such cases, VPMs develop within a continental lithosphere made harder by previous crust thinning and lithosphere thermal relaxation.",

It is a primary control on sea ice thickness and the structure of sea ice ecosystems, it dominates the uncertainty in satellite estimates of ice thickness, and it may significantly modulate the response of sea ice to climate change and variability. Here, we provide an overview of recent surveys of snow distribution (both small and large scale), its temporal evolution, and its connection with the processes that drive it – precipitation, accumulation, blowing snow events, flooding, and the role of ice deformation. We present recent 3-D in situ floe-scale measurements of snow surface topography, snow depth, and ice thickness distribution that allow relationships between surface roughness features, snow accumulation, and ice thickness to be examined in unprecedented detail. These data are compared with estimates of snow depth from the NASA IceBridge radar from spring surveys in the Weddell and Amundsen/Bellingshausen Seas. Both airborne and in situ measurements suggest a significant extent of thick ice with a deep snow cover that is underrepresented in prior surveys. Finally, the seasonal evolution of precipitation, snow depth, and accumulation is examined with data from drifting buoy platforms deployed in several regions of the Antarctic. These observations show that precipitation is not necessarily a good estimator for snow accumulation and that treatment of blowing snow must be included for sea ice models to accurately simulate Antarctic snow and sea ice mass balance. The implications of these results for modeling and satellite measurement of the sea ice thickness distribution are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is one of the most important metrics of climate change. As such, constraining the uncertainties of its magnitude, and the magnitude of its transient counterpart (TCR), is one of the primary goals of global climate science. General circulations models (GCMs) from modelling centres around the world have consistently failed to produce a model with a sensitivity of less than 2 degrees. However, as the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble is an ensemble of opportunity, it is unclear whether this fact is sufficient to rule out climate sensitivity of less than 2 degrees, or is the ensemble simply not diverse enough to sample low values of climate sensitivity? We present analysis based on the observed planetary energy budget and simple energy-balance models. When view in terms of the TCR:ECS ratio (RWF- the Realised Warming Fraction), we find a region of climate response space of low RWF and low TCR that is robust to the structure of the simple climate model and isn't sampled by the CMIP5 ensemble. We show that this region is better sampled by a perturbed physics ensemble of the HadCM3 GCM constrained solely on top of atmosphere radiative fluxes than the CMIP5 ensemble, raising the question of the physical plausibility of low climate sensitivity GCMs. Based on our results above, we have set out to systematically probe the ability to create GCMs with low climate sensitivity in the HadCM3 GCM. We train a statistical emulator on our perturbed physics ensemble and use it to identify regions of HadCM3 parameter space that are consistent with both a low climate sensitivity and a low RWF. We then run this “low sensitivity” ensemble to test our predictions and understand the combination of feedbacks needed to produce a sensible GCM with a sensitivity of less than 2 degrees. Here we hope to demonstrate our results from this systematic probing of the low climate sensitivity uncertainty bound and add further understanding to the physical plausibility of low climate sensitivity as simulated in GCMs.",

The CAM-SE dynamical core is designed with intrinsic mimetic properties guaranteeing total energy conservation (to time-truncation errors) and mass-conservation, and has demonstrated excellent scalability on massively parallel compute platforms (Taylor, 2011).\nFor applications involving many tracers such as chemistry and biochemistry modeling, CAM-SE has been found to be significantly more computationally costly than the current “workhorse” model CAM-FV (Finite-Volume; Lin 2004). Hence a multi-tracer efficient scheme, called the CSLAM (Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Multi-tracer; Lauritzen et al., 2011) scheme, has been implemented in the HOMME (Erath et al., 2012). The CSLAM scheme has recently been cast in flux-form in HOMME so that it can be coupled to the SE dynamical core through conventional flux-coupling methods where the SE dynamical core provides background air mass fluxes to CSLAM. Since the CSLAM scheme makes use of a finite-volume gnomonic cubed-sphere grid and hence does not operate on the SE quadrature grid, the capability of running tracer advection, the physical parameterization suite and dynamics on separate grids has been implemented in CAM-SE. The default CAM-SE-CSLAM setup is to run physics on the quasi-equal area CSLAM grid. The capability of running physics on a different grid than the SE dynamical core may provide a more consistent coupling since the physics grid option operates with quasi-equal-area cell average values rather than non-equi-distant grid-point (SE quadrature point) values. Preliminary results on the performance of CAM-SE-CSLAM will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We seek a paradigm shift in the approach we take on volcano monitoring where the compromise from high fidelity to large numbers of sensors is used to increase coverage and resolution. Accessibility, danger and the risk of equipment loss requires that we develop systems that are independent and inexpensive. Furthermore, rather than simply record data on hard disk for later analysis we desire a system that will work autonomously, capitalizing on wireless technology and in field network analysis. To this end we are currently producing a low cost seismic array which will incorporate, at the very basic level, seismological tools for first cut analysis of a volcano in crises mode. At the advanced end we expect to perform tomographic inversions in the network in near real time. Geophone (4 Hz) sensors connected to a low cost recording system will be installed on an active volcano where triggering earthquake location and velocity analysis will take place independent of human interaction. Stations are designed to be inexpensive and possibly disposable. In one of the first implementations the seismic nodes consist of an Arduino Due processor board with an attached Seismic Shield. The Arduino Due processor board contains an Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. This 32 bit 84 MHz processor can filter and perform coarse seismic event detection on a 1600 sample signal in fewer than 200 milliseconds. The Seismic Shield contains a GPS module, 900 MHz high power mesh network radio, SD card, seismic amplifier, and 24 bit ADC. External sensors can be attached to either this 24-bit ADC or to the internal multichannel 12 bit ADC contained on the Arduino Due processor board. This allows the node to support attachment of multiple sensors. By utilizing a high-speed 32 bit processor complex signal processing tasks can be performed simultaneously on multiple sensors. Using a 10 W solar panel, second system being developed can run autonomously and collect data on 3 channels at 100Hz for 6 months with the installed 16Gb SD card.

            "abstract": "Emergent features of landscape-climate coevolution are evaluated on the basis of the sensitivity of floods to annual precipitation in space and time. For that purpose, a spatiotemporal sensitivity analysis is performed at regional scale using data from 804 catchments in Austria from 1976 to 2008. Results show that flood peaks are more responsive to spatial (regional) than to temporal (decadal) variability. Space-wise a 10% increase in precipitation leads to a 23% increase in flood peaks in Austria, whereas timewise a 10% increase in precipitation leads to an increase of just 6% in flood peaks. Catchments from dry lowlands and high wetlands exhibit similarity between the spatial and temporal sensitivities (spatiotemporal symmetry) and low landscape-climate codependence. This suggests that such regions are not coevolving significantly. However, intermediate regions show differences between those sensitivities (symmetry breaks) and higher landscape-climate codependence, suggesting undergoing coevolution. The break of symmetry is considered an emergent behavior of the coupled system. A new coevolution index is then proposed relating spatiotemporal symmetry with relative characteristic celerities. The descriptive assessment of coevolution is complemented by a simple nonlinear dynamical model of landscape-climate coevolution, in which landform evolution processes take place at the millennial scale (slow dynamics), and climate adjusts in years to decades (fast dynamics). Coevolution is expressed by the interplay between slow and fast dynamics, represented, respectively, by spatial and temporal characteristics. The model captures key features of the joint landscape-climate distribution, supporting the descriptive assessment. This paper ultimately brings to light signatures of coevolution that arise from the nonlinear coupling of the landscape-climate system at slow and fast time scales. The presented work builds on Perdigão and Blöschl (2014).\nPerdigão, R. A. P., and G.

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycle feedbacks contribute substantial uncertainty to model projections of future climate, but the real controls and sensitivities are poorly constrained by observations, especially at large scales. Local studies provide the most direct information about cause and effect in the terresrial carbon system, but are difficult to scale up. Atmospheric analyses provide the best large-scale information, but inferences from atmospherioc CO2 are so coarse they are difficult to relate to specific mechanisms. Remote sensing is at the appropriate scale but vegetation index-based measures do not correspond directly to specific ecosystem processes and have been of limited success in parameterizing or falsifying models. We analyze extant global data sources for three key terrestrial carbon cycle quantities: ecosystem carbon fluxes, aboveground biomass and plant growth parameters (traits), revealing a sampling pattern far from optimum. Flux measurements are sparse in regions where fluxes are highest and most variable, biomass measurements are limited where biomass is highest, and plant trait data are scarcest where plant diversity is highest. The likely carbon cycle tipping point regions in high and low latitudes are scarcely observed by the standards of the mid-latitudes. Strategic and synergistic use of available in situ and emerging space-based observations can provide critical information needed to detect and forecast change. New remote sensing data products can contribute significantly to filling sampling gaps in the global observing system, as well as potentially addressing sensitivities at appropriate scales for testing global models. Environment and logistics limit extensive deployment of additional in situ observations in challenging tropical and Arctic-Boreal environments, so increasing use of space-based techniques is important for increasing sampling density and reducing uncertainty. Much greater integration between the remote sensing,atmospheric, biodiversity and terrestrial modeling communities is needed to reduce uncertainty and ensure that the critical satellite missions are selected and executed.",

            "abstract": "The formation of Earth’s core has left a compositional imprint on the mantle, depleting and fractionating most of its siderophile (iron-loving) elements. Gallium is a moderately siderophile, hence it should be strongly depleted in the mantle. However, gallium concentration in the mantle matches that of lithophile (silicate-loving) elements having the same volatility. That is to say that either gallium behaves as a lithophile element during core formation, or a large influx of gallium was brought to the Earth after the core had formed. Geochemical evidence does not support the latter hypothesis, as it would require all other lithophile elements with similar volatility to be enriched in the mantle, or for late accretion to be composed of anomalously gallium-rich objects. In order to mitigate this issue, experimental studies have tried to understand how gallium behaves during core segregation by gauging the effects of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity on the partitioning of gallium between metal and silicate. None of these parameters provided the first-order change required to match the observation.\nWe investigated the influence of core composition on gallium partitioning. The core in known to contain light-elements (oxygen, silicon sulfur and carbon), and those can change the activity of gallium in the metal, and strongly affect the behavior of gallium during core formation. We performed a series of metal-silicate partitioning experiments (2 GPa, 1673–2073 K) in a piston-cylinder press. We varied the light-element composition of the metal and observed that Si and O have a very strong influence on the activity of gallium, making it more lithophile. We then modeled terrestrial accretion as a continuous process and tested different accretion histories; we can reproduce the mantle concentration of gallium if the core segregates in a deep magma ocean (>40 GPa) and contains large amounts of silicon or oxygen.",

            "abstract": "High rates of glacier retreat for the last decades are often reported, and believed to be induced by 20th century climate changes. However, regional glacier fluctuations are complex, and depend on a combination of climate and local topography. Furthermore, in ares such as the Hindu-Kush Himalaya, there are concerns about warming, decreasing monsoon precipitation and their impact on local glacier regimes. Currently, the challenge is in understanding the magnitude of feedbacks between large-scale climate forcing and small-scale glacier behavior. Spatio-temporal patterns of glacier distribution are still llimited in some areas of the high Hindu-Kush Himalaya, but multi-temporal satellite imagery has helped fill spatial and temporal gaps in regional glacier parameters in the last decade.\nHere I present a synopsis of the behavior of glaciers across the Himalaya, following a west to east gradient. In particular, I focus on spatial patterns of glacier parameters in the eastern Himalaya, which I investigate at multi-spatial scales using remote sensing data from declassified Corona, ASTER, Landsat ETM+, Quickbird and Worldview2 sensors. I also present the use of high-resolution imagery, including texture and thermal analysis for mapping glacier features at small scale, which are particularly useful in understanding surface trends of debris-covered glaciers, which are prevalent in the Himalaya. I compare and contrast spatial patterns of glacier area and élévation changes in the monsoon-influenced eastern Himalaya (the Everest region in the Nepal Himalaya and Sikkim in the Indian Himalaya) with other observations from the dry western Indian Himalaya (Ladakh and Lahul-Spiti), both field measurements and remote sensing-based. In the eastern Himalaya, results point to glacier area change of -0.24 % ± 0.08% per year from the 1960’s to the 2006’s, with a higher rate of retreat in the last decade (-0.43% /yr). Debris-covered glacier tongues show thinning trends of -30.8 m± 39 m on average over the last four decades, similar to other studies in the same climatic area. However, at small scales, the behavior of glaciers is highly heterogenous, with contrasting patterns of thickening glacier termini versus retreating nad thinning glacier tongues.",

            "abstract": "This work used a data assimilation framework to estimate spatially and temporally continuous snow water equivalent (SWE) from a 27 year reanalysis (from water year 1985 to 2011) of the Landsat-5 record for the Kern River watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California. The data assimilation approach explicitly treats sources of uncertainty from model parameters, meteorological inputs, and observations. The method is comprised of two main components: (1) a coupled land surface model (LSM) and snow depletion curve (SDC) model, which is used to generate an ensemble of predictions of SWE and fractional snow cover area (FSCA) for a given set of prior (uncertain) inputs, and (2) a retrospective reanalysis step, which updates estimation variables to be consistent with the observed fractional snow cover time series. The final posterior SWE estimate is generated from the LSM-SDC using the posterior estimation variables consistently with all postulated sources of uncertainty in the model, inputs, and observations. A reasonable agreement was found between the SWE reanalysis and in situ SWE observations and streamflow data. The data set was studied to evaluate factors controlling SWE spatial and temporal variability. Elevation was found to be the primary control on spatial patterns of peak-SWE and day-of-peak. The easting coordinate had additional explanatory power, which is hypothesized to be related to rain shadow effects due to the prevailing storm track directions. The spatial patterns were found to be interannually inconsistent. However, drier years and lower elevations were found more variable than wetter years and higher elevations, respectively. Only a very small percentage of the Kern River watershed had a significant trend in peak-SWE and day-of-peak. Trends deemed to be significant were found to be positive (peak-SWE is increasing and day-of-peak occurs later) at higher elevations, but negative (peak-SWE is decreasing and day-of-peak occurs earlier) at lower elevations. The reanalysis approach proved to be useful in terms of identifying subwatershed variability and trends, and could be extended to larger regions and areas where in situ data are sparse or unavailable.",

Although some attempts have been made to test for kinetic effects by lateral sampling such kinetic effects still remain are emphasized by the large departure of the temperatures calculated using the Δ47proxy in speleothems.\nHere we present data from conventional δ18O isotopes in modern and ancient samples from the same cave and compare these with δ18O w analyses from drip water and from fluid inclusions. Finally these data are compared with Δ47 measurements. These data show that it is possible to reconcile all the data using the approach of Wainer et al. (Quaternary Science Reviews, 30, 130-146, 2011) which compares the offset of the Δ47 from the correct value and the difference between the δ18O data and the Kim and O'Neil ( Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, v. 61, 3461-3475, 1997) relationship in the modern samples. Using this slope the kinetic fractionation can be accounted for and a temperature estimated. The relationship can then be applied to ancient stalagmites from the Bahamas to distinguish between temperature and δ18Ow influences during important climatic events such as the Heinrich stadials. These data can then be verified by using the alternate approach of distinguishing temperature and δ18Ow, using the δ18O of water extracted from fluid inclusions to correct the δ18O of the calcite. Such suggested minimal changes in the δ18Ow and larger changes in temperatures during Heinrich events in the sub-tropics.",

            "abstract": "Forest hydrology has long debated the influence of forest gap size on the shortwave radiation regime and subsequent snowmelt rates. To address this question, a new ray trace solar transmittance model is presented to evaluate the sensitivity of gap influence on shortwave irradiance patterns to latitude, gap size, and time of year in fragmented forest environments. The ray trace model takes into account solar position, gap and forest geometry, and position within or near the gap, and was tested against measurements of shortwave radiation from 20 pyranometers in and around a gap in a mixed conifer forest and compared to simpler canopy transmittance models that ignored shading or that scaled transmittance according to leaf area index. The ray trace model reduced the large errors obtained by simple canopy transmittance models; at the 20 pyranometer locations, average biases in excess of ~ ±90 W m-2 were reduced to better than 4 W m-2. These results suggest that an accurate description of the spatial variability of solar irradiance in and around a forest gap requires explicit calculation of how gaps modify the canopy transmittance. To examine model sensitivity to key parameters, gap size, latitude, and day of year were varied under clear-sky conditions. The calculated spatial distribution patterns of cumulative daily solar irradiance inform how forest gap sizes might be optimized to minimize (shortwave) snowmelt energy. As gap size was changed for a given latitude and date, the (spatial) coefficient of variation (CV) of cumulative daily irradiance exhibited a distinct maximum that is a function of gap geometry and solar angle; smaller (larger) gaps with more diffuse (direct beam) radiation exhibited reduced spatial variability of irradiance. The results indicate that optimum forest gap sizes to reduce solar radiation while maximizing gap area depend on date and latitude; using mean snowmelt onset dates for a range of latitudes (31°N – 71°N) spanning North American conifer forests, the optimal gap radius relative to forest height H is 0.5H at and below 51°N and 0.8H at and above 61°N. The optimal forest gap size is found to be sensitive to the choice of snowmelt onset date; an earlier snowmelt onset by one-month would increase optimal forest gap radii to 0.7 – 1 H.",

At the same time, a solid understanding of the subglacial drainage system and basal motion is crucial for further ice sheet modeling and sea level rise prediction. Conditions at the ice-bed interface, however, are inherently difficult to investigate due to limited accessibility.\nSeismic signals recorded by a dense local network installed in the ablation zone of the GrIS shed some light on basal sliding and sub- and englacial drainage systems. In the slow flowing part of the GrIS, some 30km north of the calving front of Jakobshavn Isbræ, we detected basal icequakes originating near the interface of ice and underlying bed. The icequake waveform's first motions point towards shear dislocations corresponding to stick-slip motion of the ice sheet, similar to what has been observed in Antarctica. Waveform modeling of direct and critically refracted waves propagating along granitic bedrock constrain source process and bedrock properties and provide an estimate of how much till is present between ice and bedrock.\nWe observe more than 10.000 deep icequakes that can be grouped into more than 30 clusters with up to 2000 events per cluster originating in an area of approximately 1 km in diameter. Nearly identical waveforms in each cluster indicate that repeating source processes and failure mechanisms occur in the same volume. The magnitude and occurrence frequency of events for some clusters show a close temporal correlation with water level measured in a nearby moulin and surface velocity measured by differential GPS. These observations provide quantitative insights into the interplay between sudden seismogenic episodes of basal motion and glacier hydraulics, thus filling a critical data gap in our understanding of ice sheet flow.",

This talk will describe the origins of this single-center/multi-model approach, and its evolution through configurations consisting of two and subsequently four 2-tier models in the 1990s and 2000s, to the current Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS).

            "abstract": "Areal coverage and spatial distribution of sea-ice melt ponds are key factors in determining the response of the Arctic Ocean’s ice cover to changes in atmospheric forcing, its importance in enhancing high-latitude warming and its function in polar marine ecosystems. A review of remote-sensing and field observations, in conjunction with process studies in coastal Alaska, highlights the importance of sub-floe scale ice properties and processes in controlling ponding, thereby constraining seasonal evolution and decay of the ice cover. Field observations and model simulations have shown how pond areal extent and hence ice albedo depend on the combination of snow or ice ablation rates, ice permeability and surface topography. Seasonal and short-term variations of these three factors explain much of the observed spatial and temporal variability in the large-scale pond areal fraction. Recent work on Alaska shorefast ice suggests that the snow-cover depth distribution may predetermine ponding patterns months ahead of spring melt. Specifically, through the formation of wind crusts, snow depth variations are locked in place. After onset of melt, formation and deepening of ponds is enhanced in thin-snow areas, with pond spatial patterns replicating snow dune topography. Both deepening of ponds and preferential pond drainage through small-scale flaws and cracks then constrain the eventual break-up of the ice cover. Field observations and aerial photography indicate that with increasing wave action in an ice-diminished Arctic Ocean, ponds and drainage features precondition ice for break-up and fragmentation. Model simulations by Schröder et al. (doi:10.1038/nclimate2203) hint at other, as of yet poorly understood mechanisms that link pond coverage to the degree of seasonal ice retreat. Key measurements and potential datasets that can help improve understanding and prediction of a changing ice cover on seasonal scales will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Phreato-magmatic vents (esp. maar craters) are rare in the ~40,000 Km2 Plio-Quaternary monogenetic Michoacán-Guanajuato Volcanic Field (MGVF) located in the central part of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. In contrast to >1000 scoria cones, only 2 dozen phreato-magmatic monogenetic vents (e.g. tuff cones, tuff rings, and maars) have been identified. About half of these form a cluster near Valle de Santiago in the Lerma river valley at the northern margin of the MGVF, while the others occur in a rather scattered fashion. Here we discuss the origin of Alberca de Guadalupe maar crater, one of the three phreato-magmatic vents (in addition to El Caracol and Alberca de Los Espinos) that occur within the boundaries of the inter-montane lacustrine Zacapu basin, a tectonic graben bound by an ENE-WSW normal fault system. The maar crater came into existence between 20,000 and 23,000 y BP, forming a 140 m deep hole in the otherwise planar surrounding ground of theearly Pleistocene lava flows of Cerro Pelón.The maar crater has a diameter of ~1 Km and bears a 9 m deep lake. Eruptive products include typical surge deposits that are best exposed around the rim and inner crater walls. They are poorly sorted (Mdø= -1.56 to -3.75, ø= 1.43 to 3.23), rich in accidental lithics (angular andesitic lava and ignimbrite clasts) constituting 51-88% of the deposit with few juveniles (basaltic andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene in a quenched glassy matrix; SiO2=54-58 wt. %). Dry surge units are friable and clast-supported, in contrast the wet surge units are fairly indurated and bear accretionary lapilli. Bedding is frequently distorted by ballistic impact-sag structures. The entire construct is disrupted by an E-W trending regional fault, downthrowing the northern part by ~30 m.\nThe unusual formation of this maar crater in the semi-arid highlands of Zacapu was favored by the local hydrological and topographical conditions. Such conditions still prevail in several parts of the MGVF, making it possible for such an event to occur again, considering the active nature of this region, which is famous for its historic 1943-1952 eruption of Paricutin.",

            "abstract": "In urban areas leaf area index (LAI) is a key ecosystem structural attribute with implications for energy and water balance, gas exchange, and anthropogenic energy use. Typically, citywide LAI estimates are extrapolated from those made on forest inventory sample plots through intensive crown measurement and allometric scaling. This is a time- and labor-intensive process yielding coarse spatial resolution results. In this study we generate spatially explicit estimates of LAI using high-point density airborne lidar throughout our study area in downtown Santa Barbara, CA. We implement two theoretically distinct modeling approaches. First, based on hemispherical photography at our 71 field plots, we estimate effective LAI using scan-angle corrected lidar laser penetration metrics (LPM). For our second approach, we adapt existing allometric equations for use with a suite of crown structural metrics (e.g., tree height, crown base height) measured with lidar. This approach allows for estimates of LAI to be made at the individual tree crown scale (ITC). This is important for evaluating fine-scale interactions between canopy and urban surfaces.\nThe LPM method resulted in good agreement with field estimates (r2 = 0.80) and a slope of near unity (β = 0.998) using a model that assumed a spherical leaf angle distribution. Within ITC segments that were automatically delineated using watershed segmentation, lidar estimates of crown structure closely paralleled field measurements (r2=0.87 for crown length). LAI estimates based on the lidar structural variables corresponded well with estimates from field measurements (r2 = 0.84). Agreement between the LPM and allometric lidar methods was also strong across the 71 validation plots (r2 = 0.88) and among 450 sample points (r2 = 0.72) randomly distributed throughout the citywide maps. This is notably higher than the agreement between the hemiphoto and allometric ground-based estimates (r2 = 0.56). The allometric approach generally yielded higher estimates except for under closed, broadleaf canopy. The first-order agreement between these two disparate methods may indicate that the error bounds for mapping LAI in cities are small enough to pursue large scale spatially explicit estimation.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation of isoprene by OH and NO3 has a large but uncertain impact on the budget of NOx (and hence O3) through the formation and photochemical transformation of organic nitrates. Recent laboratory work have put strong constraints on the chemical lifetimes of the primary hydroxynitrates formed from isoprene+OH. We show that the carbonyl nitrates formed in the subsequent oxidation of the primary nitrates by OH photolyze much more more rapidly than previously believed, due to absorption cross section enhancement effects and a quantum yield likely of the order of unity. New recommendations for the photolysis parameters are provided, and the resulting photorates are validated using the temporal profiles of different compounds abserved in the isoprene oxidation laboratory experiment of Paulot et al. (209).\nNext, a detailed isoprene oxidation mechanism based on the recently published Leuven Isoprene Mechanism version 1 (LIM1) (Peeters et al., 2014) and on the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCMv32) has been developed. The impact of the fast photolysis of carbonyl nitrates is investigated by box model simulations. A reduced version of this explicit mechanism is constructed, which is shown to provide essentially the same results as the explicit mechanism for key compounds. The reduced mechanism is incorporated in a global chemistry-transport model, IMAGES (Stavrakou et al., 2013). We investigate the budget of organic nitrates, considering contributions from isoprene, monoterpenes, small alkenes and other precursors. The model predictions are tested against aircraft campaigns such as INTEX-A and ARCTAS. The predicted organic nitrate concentrations are in very reasonable agreement with the data in the boundary layer over isoprene-rich areas. Examination of the discrepancies in other areas (boreal forests, N-E United States, also the free troposphere) provide clues regarding missing pathways in the model.",

            "abstract": "Chemical reactions in the aqueous phase are thought to significantly contribute to ambient aerosol mass under specific conditions. Results from many laboratory studies suggest that these reactions are efficiently initiated by the OH radical and lead to high molecular weight compounds (oligomers). Recent laboratory experiments have shown that methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) can form oligomers in high yield in aqueous solutions similar to aerosol water. Additional experiments have shown that the direct photolysis of pyruvic acid can generate organic radicals that initiate similar oligomer products upon oxidation of MVK (Renard et al., submitted).\nSources of the OH radical in the aerosol aqueous phase include the direct uptake from the gas phase, Fenton reactions and, to a smaller extent, direct photolyses of hydrogen peroxide and nitrate. Recent model studies imply that under many conditions, aqSOA formation might be oxidant-limited since these OH(aq) sources are not sufficient to provide a continuous OH supply. This limitation can be (partially) removed if additional radical sources in the multiphase system are considered. Exemplary, we include the direct photolysis of aqueous pyruvic acid as a proxy for possible other radical sources. Model results will be shown and consequences for aqSOA formation and processing under ambient conditions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Many channels alternate longitudinally between bedrock and alluvial substrate. These alternations occur over a range of spatial scales and associated temporal scales. Transient bedrock and alluvial patches alternate over downstream distances of a few meters to hundreds of meters, whereas persistent bedrock and alluvial reaches alternate downstream over distances of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. These longitudinal alternations are significant because of the differences in process and form between bedrock and alluvial reaches. Bedrock reaches limit the response of the channel and the greater drainage basin to relative base level fall. Alluvial reaches limit the rate and distance of particle movement downstream, as well as limiting the habitat available for riverine organisms, biogeochemical reactions and nutrient storage, and water quality. In both types of substrate, particle movement is a limiting factor. (Here, particles include mineral sediment and particulate organic matter.) In bedrock channels, particle movement largely governs the rate and manner of erosion. In alluvial channels, particle movement governs channel form and the stability of habitat. Fundamental research questions for both channel types center on particle dynamics: How do interactions among bedrock substrate, sediment supply, sediment transport, and hydraulics influence rates of bedrock erosion? How do interactions among sediment supply, sediment transport, and biota influence particle transport and residence time? Although bedrock channel segments likely exert a more fundamental influence on river response to relative base level change and landscape evolution, alluvial channel segments likely exert a stronger limiting effect on downstream fluxes of water, solutes, and particles, as well as more critical influences on riverine habitat.",

            "abstract": "Legacy sediments are those that are altered by human activities. Alterations include (i) human-caused aggradation (and subsequent erosion), such as sediment accumulating upstream from relict or contemporary dams, (ii) human-caused lack of continuing deposition that results in changing moisture and nutrient levels within existing sediments, such as on floodplains that no longer receive lateral or vertical accretion deposits because of levees, bank stabilization, and other channel engineering, and (iii) human-generated contaminants such as PCBs and pesticides that adsorb to fine sediment. Existing estimates of human alterations of river systems suggest that legacy sediments are ubiquitous. Only an estimated 2% of river miles in the United States are not affected by flow regulation that alters sediment transport, for example, and less than half of major river basins around the world are minimally altered by flow regulation. Combined with extensive but poorly documented reduction in floodplain sedimentation, as well as sediment contamination by diverse synthetic compounds, excess nutrients, and heavy metals, these national and global estimates suggest that legacy sediments now likely constitute a very abundant type of fluvial sediment. Because legacy sediments can alter river form and function for decades to centuries after the cessation of the human activity that created the legacy sediments, river management and restoration must be informed by accurate knowledge of the distribution and characteristics of legacy sediments. Geomorphologists can contribute understanding of sediment dynamics, including: the magnitude, frequency, and duration of flows that mobilize sediments with adsorbed contaminants; sites where erosion and deposition are most likely to occur under specified flow and sediment supply; residence time of sediments; and the influence of surface and subsurface water fluxes on sediment stability and geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are important contributors to cool season precipitation in the Southwestern US, and in some cases can lead to extreme hydrometeorological events in the region. We performed a climatological analysis and identified two predominant types of ARs that affect the Southwest: Type 1 ARs originate in the tropics near Hawaii (central Pacific) and enhance their moisture in the midlatitudes, with maximum moisture transport over the ocean at low-levels of the troposphere. On the other hand, moisture in Type 2 ARs has a more direct tropical origin and meridional orientation with maximum moisture transfer at mid-levels.\nWe then analyze future projections of Southwest ARs in a suite of global and regional climate models (from NARCCAP), to evaluate projected future changes in the frequency and intensity of ARs under warmer global climate conditions. We find a consistent and clear intensification of the water vapor transport associated with the ARs that impinge upon Arizona and adjacent regions, however, the response of AR-related precipitation intensity to increased moisture flux and column-integrated water vapor is weak and no robust variations are projected either by the GCMs or the NARCCAP models.\nTo evaluate the effect of horizontal resolution and improve our physical understanding of these results, we numerically simulated a historical AR event using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at a 3km resolution. We then performed a pseudo-global warming experiment by modifying the lateral and lower boundary conditions to reflect possible changes in future ARs (as projected by the ensemble of GCM simulations used for NARCCAP). Interestingly we find that despite higher specific humidity, some regions still receive less rainfall in the warming climate experiments – partially due to changes in thermodynamics, but primarily due to AR dynamics. Therefore, we conclude from this analysis that overall future increase in atmospheric temperature and water content as projected by GCMs will not necessarily translate into generalized heavier AR-related precipitation in the Southwestern US.",

            "abstract": "When implementing computer vision codes, a common reaction to the high angular resolution and the high cadence of SDO’s image products has been to reduce the resolution and cadence of the data so that it “looks like” SOHO data. This can be partially justified on physical grounds: if the phenomenon that a computer vision code is trying to detect was characterized in low-resolution, low cadence data, then the higher quality data may not be needed. But sacrificing at least two, and sometimes all four main advantages of SDO’s imaging data (the other two being a higher duty cycle and additional data products) threatens to also discard the perhaps more subtle discoveries waiting to be made: a classic baby-with-the-bath-water situation. In this presentation, we discuss some of the sacrifices made in implementing SWAMIS-EF, an automatic emerging magnetic flux region detection code for SDO/HMI, and how those sacrifices simultaneously simplified and complicated development of the code. SWAMIS-EF is a feature-finding code, and we will describe some situations and analyses in which a feature-finding code excels, and some in which a different type of algorithm may produce more favorable results. In particular, because the solar magnetic field is irreducibly complex at the currently observed spatial scales, searching for phenomena such as flux emergence using even semi-strict physical criteria often leads to large numbers of false or missed detections. This undesirable behavior can be mitigated by relaxing the imposed physical criteria, but here too there are tradeoffs: decreased numbers of missed detections may increase the number of false detections if the selection criteria are not both sensitive and specific to the searched-for phenomenon. Finally, we describe some recent steps we have taken to overcome these obstacles, by fully embracing the high resolution, high cadence SDO data, optimizing and partially parallelizing our existing code as a first step to allow fast magnetic feature tracking of full resolution HMI magnetograms. Even with the above caveats, if used correctly such a tool can provide a wealth of information on the positions, motions, and patterns of features, enabling large, cross-scale analyses that can answer important questions related to the solar dynamo and to coronal heating.",

            "abstract": "In July 2014, the U. S. Geological Survey released an update of the 2008 National Seismic Hazard Map for the coterminous U. S. The Map provides guidance for the seismic provisions of the building codes and portrays ground motions with a 2% chance of being exceeded in an exposure time of 50 years. Over most of the midcontinent the hazard model is derived by projecting the long-term historic, declustered earthquake rate forward in time. However, parts of the midcontinent have experienced increased seismicity levels since 2009 – locally by 2 orders of magnitude – which is incompatible with the underlying assumption of a constant-rate Poisson process. The 2014 Map acknowledged this problem, and for its intended purpose of underpinning seismic design used seismicity rates that are consistent with the entire historic record. Both the developers of the Map and its critics acknowledge that the remarkable rise of seismicity in Oklahoma and nearby states must be addressed if we are to fully capture the hazard in both space and time. The nature of the space/time distribution of the increased seismicity, as well as numerous published case studies strongly suggest that much of the increase is of anthropogenic origin. If so, the assumptions and procedures used to forecast natural earthquake rates from past rates may not be appropriate. Here we discuss key issues that must be resolved include: the geographic location of areas with elevated seismicity, either active now or potentially active in the future; local geologic conditions including faults and the state of stress; the spatial smoothing of catalog seismicity; the temporal evolution of the earthquake rate change; earthquake sequence statistics including clustering behavior; the magnitude-frequency distribution of the excess earthquakes, particularly to higher and yet unobserved magnitudes; possible source process differences between natural and induced earthquakes; and the appropriate ground motion prediction equations.",

For the approximate range of surface temperatures, the residence time of N2 on the surface can range from a fraction of a second to 10’s of years with the near surface line of sight column densities varying from ~3×1018 N2/m2 up to >6×1019N2/m2. Additional mechanisms that can eject N2molecules from the surface include cometary impacts (Stern et al. 2014) and electronic sputtering (Johnson et al., 2013). A Charon atmosphere could be detectable during the solar occultation that will occur during the New Horizon encounter providing a measure of the transfer of gas between bodies in this binary system.\nTucker, O.J., Erwin, J.T., Deighan, J.I., Volkov, A.N., Johnson, R.E., 2012.

            "abstract": "Turbulence heats the solar wind as it expands away from the Sun, but where and how does heating of ions and electrons occur? In order to understand this we must first look at the fluctuations making up the cascade, the properties and anisotropies of which will determine whether ions or electrons are heated and whether field-parallel or -perpendicular heating will occur, all of which amounts to a lot of different anisotropies! With this in mind, we present a review of recent advances in the observation of plasma turbulence in the solar wind and comparison with simulations; which features of solar wind turbulence are well reproduced and which need to be captured better?\nThe first anisotropy is that of the fluctuations making up the turbulent cascade itself, fluctuations are known to be highly transverse, meaning that the perpendicular magnetic field components are dominant over the field-parallel component. The second anisotropy is that of the scaling of amplitude towards smaller scales with steeper spectra parallel to the local magnetic field direction. Observations of the anisotropy of the full power spectral tensor will be discussed, in particular with reference to Alfvenic and pseudo-Alfvenic fluctuations (effectively two different polarizations of Alfven waves), the next step beyond the traditional \"slab + 2D\" approach to incompressible MHD turbulence. The third anisotropy is that of the ion and electron distributions. Both sets of charged particles frequently show non-Maxwellian distributions with higher temperatures found either perpendicular to or parallel to the magnetic field direction. Proton distributions often show beams and the heavier alpha particles are often hotter than the protons. Localized structures such as current sheets and magnetic discontinuities are shown to be sites of intense and anisotropic heating. Small scale fluctuations filling the space between such discontinuities may also dissipate energy into ions and electrons, either through electric fields intrinsic to the modes generated by the turbulence or through resonant or stochastic processes. Observations show that kinetic Alfven waves are the dominant mode.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of soil carbon stocks and fluxes continues to be an important endeavor in assessments of soil quality, and more broadly in assessments of ecosystem functioning. The quantification of soil carbon in alkaline, carbonate-containing soils, such as those found in Mediterranean areas, is complicated by the need to differentiate between organic carbon (OC) and inorganic carbon (IC), which continues to present methodological challenges. Acidification is frequently used to eliminate carbonates prior to soil OC quantification, but when performed in the liquid phase, can promote the dissolution and loss of a portion of the OC. Acid fumigation (AF) is increasingly preferred for carbonate removal, but its effectiveness is difficult to assess using conventional elemental and isotopic analyses. The two-step approach is time, labor and cost intensive, and generates additional uncertainties from the calculations. Quantification of the actively cycling pool of soil organic C (SOC) in many soils is further complicated by the potential presence of more recalcitrant/stable forms such as pyrogenic or black carbon (BC) derived from incomplete combustion of vegetation, or even geogenic carbon such as coal. The wide spectrum of materials currently considered BC makes its quantification challenging. The chemical method using benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) as markers of condensed aromatic structures indicative of pyrogenic C is highly time, labor and cost intensive, and can generate artifacts. Several research groups are now developing method for the simultaneous identification and quantification of these various forms of soil carbon using thermal analysis techniques such as thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and evolved gas analysis. The objective of this presentation is to provide a general overview and specific examples of the current progress and technical challenges in this evolving methodology.",

            "abstract": "Storm activity strongly influences coastal zones in both environmental/physical and socio-economical ways. Of particular concern are damages and major local impacts, including inundation and coastal erosion, that are caused by storm interaction with the ocean. Canada’s east coast is particularly influenced by winter storms which track along two favoured routes: the St. Lawrence Valley and the Eastern Seaboard, while the west coast is influenced by the North Pacific storm track and by \"atmospheric river\" events. Reanalysis provides an invaluable tool for studying the characteristics of storm events that are identified as causing the most severe impacts. However, the accurate depiction of storm activity using reanalysis products is not straightforward, given differences in spatial resolution and model physics. This study evaluates the representation of storm activity along the east and west Canadian coastlines by commonly used global reanalyses distributed by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (including NCEP-1, NCEP-2, and Twentieth Century Reanalysis) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (including ERA-Interim). Reanalysis datasets are evaluated using selected stations along each coastline and pressure tendency as a proxy for storm activity. Station selection criteria considered record length (~40 years or longer), reporting frequency (daily or shorter), proximity to coastline, and a relatively uniform spatial distribution. Comparisons are made using data extracted from the reanalysis grid point that is closest to each selected station. Preliminary results for reanalysis storm activity representations (proxies calculated annually) were presented at the 2013 AGU Fall Meeting (A53B-0161). Seasonal representations (JFM, AMJ, JAS, OND, and “extended winter” ONDJFM) have since been investigated to obtain a more detailed understanding of the Canadian coastal storm activity representations by these commonly used global reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "The geologic record holds a rich history of abrupt ecological and climate change events but our understanding of the ocean-atmosphere dynamics involved is not well developed, particularly for high CO2 warm climate states of the pre-Quaternary because the deep-sea records available typically come from low sedimentation rate (of 1-2 cm/kyr) sites that do not permit studies on times scales similar to or shorter than the ~1500 year mixing time of the ocean.\nThe principle objective of IODP Expedition 342 (drilled summer, 2012) was to target sediment drifts off Newfoundland with unusually high rates of sedimentation in order to investigate, for the first time, the stability of the Cenozoic greenhouse and icehouse climate states on sub-orbital timescales. The sedimentary sequences drilled accumulated directly under the flow path of the Deep Western Boundary Current and are well-situated to provide an archive of changes in chemistry, flow history, and depth structure of waters exiting the Nordic seas and Arctic Ocean during the transition from ice-free peak Cenozoic warmth in the early Eocene to the onset of Arctic sea ice formation and the growth of major ice sheets on Antarctica. The sediment drift deposits drilled are characterized by high sedimentation rates and clay-rich lithologies hosting spectacularly well-preserved calcareous microfossils (benthic and planktic) and sand-sized lithic fragments. These remarkable archives present an exciting opportunity to address some long-standing questions of relevance to this session. For example: (1) How stable was the Eocene greenhouse climate state? (2) Is large amplitude suborbital variability in Earth’s climate restricted to the late Pleistocene? (3) When and why did Earth shift to its present climate state with large ice sheets in both hemispheres? (4) How valid are suggestions of Eocene bipolar glaciation? (5) How and why did the carbonate chemistry (CCD) and circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean change in association with these shifts in global climate?",

These maps revealed a bright, narrow Ribbon of ENAs encircling the sky that appears to be organized by the local interstellar magnetic field. Remarkably, this feature was totally unexpected and unpredicted by any prior theory or model. Since its discovery, over a dozen theories have been proposed to explain what physical phenomena might cause this remarkable feature. These possible explanations span from sources inside the termination shock at less than 100 AU to others some 1000 AU away - outside the heliosphere in the local interstellar medium. Here we 1) summarize the observational aspects of the Ribbon as established over IBEX’s first five full years of observations, 2) summarize the primary current ideas of what physical phenomena may be producing this feature, and 3) briefly examine the respective strengths and weaknesses of the various interpretations.",

            "abstract": "The influence of Gravitational Slope Deformations (GSD) on mountain belts’ erosion rate has been identified worldwide and more particularly in valleys that were affected by quaternary glacial retreat. However, owing to the lack of comprehensive identification of the predisposing factor influencing their spatial distribution, size and failure mechanisms, their effective impact on the landscape evolution remain difficult to quantify. In this contribution, we present the first regional-scale detailed GSD inventory of the entire upper Rhone catchment (Western Switzerland). The detection and mapping of GSD are performed by combining different remote sensing approaches. Moreover, a detailed characterization of the different inventoried events is proposed, taking into account their geometry, morphology and failure mechanism. Based on these analyses, more than 300 GSDs, corresponding to 11% of the entire study area, are identified. Spatial and statistical analyses highlight that GSDs are not uniformly distributed within the study area but that six clusters, encompassing more than 80% of the detected instabilities, can be highlighted. Our investigations demonstrate that the GSD clusters are mainly related to the coexistence of active tectonic processes (including high uplift gradients and seismic activity), large scale brittle tectonic weakness zones and high local relief. In addition, climate forcing is also identified to influence the distribution of GSD, via relief creation and in particular by the formation of overdeepened areas operated by glaciers during LGM. Conversely, lithological and structural conditions appear to primarily control the failure mechanism and the size of the detected GSDs but do not influence their spatial distribution. The strong impact of active tectonic processes on GSD distribution suggests that its effective role needs to be revaluated in order to better understand and quantify post-glacial erosion rate.",

            "abstract": "Temperature, food availability, and predation risk form vertical gradients determining growth and survival for fish in lakes and reservoirs. These gradients change on inter-annual, seasonal, and diel temporal scales and are strongly influenced by climatic variability, conflicting water demands and management. Temperatures associated with optimal growth and energy loss vary both among life stages and species of fish, but the quantity and quality of available food resources can significantly alter these thermal responses. Greater understanding of how water management affects the timing, magnitude, and duration of thermal stratification, and how key species and their supporting aquatic resources respond can improve strategies for development and operation of water storage facilities within the context of localized environmental and ecological constraints.\nAn emerging trend for coldwater reservoirs in the Pacific Northwest has been to re-introduce anadromous salmon above historically impassable dams. Thermal regimes and the existing ecological communities in the reservoirs and tributary habitats above these dams will determine the seasonal importance of lotic and lentic habitats for rearing or migration corridors. The feasibility of reservoir rearing and migration can be evaluated by combining mass- and species-specific thermal growth response curves with temporal dynamics in the vertical and longitudinal thermal structure of reservoirs and associated distribution of food resources (primarily zooplankton). The value of reservoirs as rearing habitats or migration corridors could be compared with coincident tributary conditions to predict the likely temporal-spatial distribution of optimal conditions for growth and survival of different species or life stages of salmonids within the watershed and how these conditions might change under different climatic or water management scenarios.",

Clearly the most robust and best informed inversions for modern ice mass changes will utilize the GNET displacement history, GRACE's mass fields, and ice surface height changes derived from repeat altimetry and repeat optical DEMs. These inversions will also be guided by measured changes in ice flow rates, surface mass balance estimates from numerical weather models, and models of glacial isostatic adjustment. Designing an optimal inverse method requires us to asses and exploit the strengths of each class of observation in order to offset the main weaknesses in the others. GPS and GRACE are the only techniques that directly sense ice mass changes, and we present an analysis of accerations in both time series which demonstrates that GNET senses the lateral variability of ice mass accelerations in SE Greenland with much better resolution than does GRACE. When an optimal model for modern ice mass changes is achieved, and the associated elastic adjustments are subtracted from the GPS displacements, the residual displacements can be used to characterize visoelastic adjusments. These should promote an improved 'PGR correction' for GRACE.",

            "abstract": "In 2000, while visiting Arches National Park in Utah, I had my first encounter with my science in the context of interpretation. During a ranger walk, a student intern at the park explained the concept of the radiation budget (for the desert surface, in her case) to the group of visitors. As a NASA scientist on the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) science team, a team whose entire focus is on understanding Earth’s energy budget, that visit made quite an impression on me: here was my science connected to the immediate and personal experience of that desert environment in a way that even my then 4-year-old daughter could take something from.\nSome years later, when I was invited to speak to a group of interpreters through the NASA/National Park Service “Earth to Sky” project, I jumped at the chance. Since then, I have had several opportunities to interact with interpreters, through additional “Earth to Sky” workshops as well as during a meeting of the National Association for Interpretation in my hometown. While I was invited to speak to these groups as a subject matter expert, I always learned at least as much as they did from the interaction. The standard practice for Earth to Sky is to pair presenters with an interpreter coach to help fine-tune the presentation for the audience – a valuable practice for presentations to any audience, if one can find an appropriate coach. The mere idea that interpretation is a profession, with research and guidelines and best practices, was completely eye opening to me at one of my first Earth to Sky events.\nSo how to leverage interpretation for science communication? Rather than expecting busy scientists to learn everything about interpretation, a more effective approach is likely the one taken in the Earth to Sky workshop series, where scientists and interpreters work together for an intensive period to share information and approaches, and the interpreters are then able to take appropriate science elements to weave into their own interpretative practices in their local settings. This presentation will share experiences and lessons learned from these interactions, will further explain the Earth to Sky model, and will suggest ways that scientists can make connections with interpreters who may be able to communicate their science in unique and personal ways.",

            "abstract": "Given the continued need to educate the public on both the meteorological and engineering hazards posed by the severe winds of a tornado, an interdisciplinary STEM module designed by faculty from the Oceanography and Mechanical Engineering departments at the U.S. Naval Academy was developed to engage students ages 12-16 in the fields of meteorology and engineering. Interdisciplinary educational modules such as this one are becoming increasingly common components of academic outreach programs, but to our knowledge, this is one of the first to combine the fields of meteorology and engineering. While many studies have examined changes in student engagement and interest in the STEM fields as a result of participating in interdisciplinary activities such as this one, relatively fewer have focused on quantifying changes in student content knowledge. The primary purposes of this paper are to (1) describe our interdisciplinary STEM module in detail, and (2) report immediate changes in students’ knowledge of basic meteorological and engineering content as a result of their participation in the module. Results from a quick, easy-to-administer assessment instrument given to students immediately before and after their participation in the 1-hour module indicated that they learned basic content in both meteorology and engineering. Mean improvement of scores on the assessment questions was 40.2%, a change that was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Future studies of student learning could gain additional insight into the value of the module by lengthening the time between student participation in the module and the administration of the post-module assessment.",

            "abstract": "Arguments against Pangea B are that the Intra-Pangean Paleomagnetic anomaly was based on poor data, and that there is no geological evidence for the megashear required to bring about Pangea A prior to the Triassic. I address the implications of map-view bends (oroclines) of the Carboniferous Variscan orogen, the orogen inferred to record the Pangea-forming Gondwana – Laurussia continental collision upon closure of an intervening Rheic ocean.\nThe Variscan orogen of Iberia has been depicted as a convex to the west arcuate feature (the Ibero-Armorican Arc). The IAA assumes continuity of geological belts of southern Great Britain, and is cored by the Cantabrian orocline, an isoclinal orocline affecting the Gondwana foreland fold and thrust belt. We demonstrated that the Cantabrian orocline is coupled to a more southerly convex to the west Central Iberian Orocline. Together these coupled oroclines (1) define a continental scale S-shaped fold of the Variscan orogen; and (2) require that the continuation of the Rheic suture and Variscan geological belts lies to the west and south. Palinspastic restoration of the oroclines yields a 2300 km long previously linear orogen. Paleomagnetic, structural and stratigraphic data constrain orocline formation to a 10 Ma interval starting at ~ 300 Ma, involving 1100 km of relative translation. The Rheic suture and geological belts in southeastern England similarly define a convex to the west ‘Welsh’ orocline: a NNE-striking serpentinite belt in SE Ireland is a continuation of the Lizard ophiolite around the orocline. This geometry implies that the Rheic suture and more internal geological belts cross back into Britain to the north, and explains paleomagnetic data that suggest 180° of rotation of southern Britain. Orocline formation is probably coeval with Cornubian magmatism and requires subduction and large-scale translations as late as 270 Ma.\nThe Iberian and Welsh oroclines require thousands of kms of translation between 310 and 270 Ma at rates of as high as 10 cm/a. The creation of large-scale oroclines, the implied rates of translation, and the voluminous syn-kinematic magmatism all points to the need for subduction of oceanic lithosphere within the heart of Pangea well into the Permian and suggests that the ‘megashear’ may have consisted of one or more subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Major, trace element and isotopic data along the SW Indian Ridge identify two major geochemical provinces centered on the Marion and Bouvet Hotspots with prominent correlations between the isotopic and major element composition of basalts, ridge depth, and mineralogy of spatially associated mantle peridotites. Both consist of axial rises with elevated ridge topography. Both the Bouvet and Marion Hotspots have small volcanic fluxes, while the associated axial-rises contrast sharply in size and geochemistry. The Bouvet Rise is small, proportional to the size of the hotspot, while the Marion, with Iceland, is one of the two largest oceanic rises. A mantle plume associated with the Marion Hotspot is incapable of supporting the rise; rather it appears to be supported by a large region of anomalously depleted mantle1. The Bouvet Plume, which likely originates above the mantle transition zone, appears to have had a direct control on the geometry of the western SWIR through time and thus likely does support the short Bouvet Rise. The bathymetric contrast between these two rises corresponds to notable differences in isotopic geochemistry: while the Marion Rise basalts exhibit a complex pattern of variability – it is a region where the classic ‘Dupal’ anomaly is well expressed, consistent with a major Archean mantle source that likely represents delaminated metasomatized sub-continental lithosphere entrained in the shallow mantle beneath the Ridge during formation of the central and SW Indian Ridges with the breakup of Gondwana. This is supported by a similar isotopic anomaly along the Rodriguez Rise on the Central Indian Ridge that also appears related to Gondwana breakup. By contrast, the mantle beneath the Bouvet Rise appears to represent largely post-Archean asthenosphere pulled from beneath the Gondwana lithosphere, interacting with a local small plume reflecting a local heterogeneity in the upper mantle.\n1.

            "abstract": "Protein stable isotope fingerprinting (P-SIF) is a method to measure the carbon isotope ratios of whole proteins separated from complex mixtures, including cultures and environmental samples. The goal of P-SIF is to expose the links between identity and function in microbial ecosystems by (i) determining the ratios of 13C/12C (values of δ13C) for different taxonomic divisions, and (ii) using those values as clues to the metabolic pathways employed by the respective organisms, while (iii) not perturbing the system, i.e., not adding exogenous substrates or isotope labels. To accomplish this, we employ two-dimensional HPLC to resolve a sample containing ca. 5-10 mg of mixed proteins into 960-1440 fractions. Each fraction then is split in two aliquots: The first is digested with trypsin for peptide sequencing, while the second is measured in triplicate using an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer interfaced with a spooling wire microcombustion device. Data from pure cultures show that bacteria have a narrow distribution of protein δ13C values within individual taxa (±0.7-1.2‰, 1σ). This is moderately larger than the mean precision of the triplicate isotope measurements (±0.5‰, 1σ) and may reflect heterogeneous distribution of 13C among the amino acids. When cells from different species are mixed together prior to protein extraction and separation, the results can predict accurately (to within ±1σ) the δ13C values of the original taxa. The number of data points required for this endmember prediction is ≥20/taxon, yielding a theoretical resolution of ca. 10 taxonomic units/sample. Initial tests on environmental samples suggest the approach will be useful to determine the overall trophic breadth of mixed microbial ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of volcanic hazard is often difficult, particularly at those areas, where no volcanic events have been documented in the historical time or even longer. Here, we present new geochronological data to demonstrate that relatively young volcanism occurred in eastern-central Europe, at the Ciomadul volcano (southeast Carpathians, Romania) and there is a potential for future rejuvenation. The eruption ages of the Ciomadul are constrained by (U-Th)/He zircon dating corrected for U-series disequilibrium and this suggests that the volcanic activity occurred from 150 ka to 32 ka. Following a lava dome building stage, a more explosive eruption phase took place at 50-32 ka. Subplinian to plinian eruptions produced volcanic ash clouds that blanketed extended areas. The U-Th and U-Pb age spectra of the zircons from the 50-32 ka volcanic rocks ranges over 300 ka and is thus indicative of a long-lasting intrusive body beneath the volcano. Interior-rim age difference within individual zircons is as much as 340-88 ka. Thus, a subterraneous magma system was already under construction ca. 150-200 ka before the onset of volcanic eruptions. The peak zircon crystallization age falls between 220-100 ka, and there are only sparse age data <100 ka indicating that conditions became unfavourable for zircon crystallization, possibly due to sluggish precipitation at low temperatures or complete solidification within some parts of the magma system. Nevertheless, rim-analysis (outer 4 μm) of the youngest, 32 ka zircons shows that crystallization occurred also at 60-80 ka, but this still precedes the eruption age by about 30-40 ka. All samples contain zircons with widely differing ages which cover the entire 300 ka period of magma evolution at Ciomadul. These data reflect that a melt-bearing crystal mush body could have continuously existed beneath the volcano. Intermittent injections of hotter magma into the cold crystal mush could help to maintain the magma system over 100’s ka. Magnetotelluric data indicates that melt-bearing crystal mush body could still be present beneath Ciomadul. Although 32 ka has elapsed since the last eruption, the prolonged lifetime of the magma system and the presence of partial melt still beneath the volcano suggests that rejuvenation of volcanic activity cannot be dismissed.",

            "abstract": "Changes in global population, food consumption and climate lead to a food security challenge for the future. Water resources, agricultural productivity and the relationships between them will to a large extent dictate how we address this challenge. Although food security is a global issue, impacts of climate change on water resources and agricultural productivity, as well as viability of adaptation strategies, are location specific; e.g., it is important to consider the regional regulatory environment.\nOur work focuses on the Columbia River basin (CRB) of the Pacific Northwest US. The water resources of the CRB are heavily managed to meet competing demands. There also exists a legal system for individuals/groups to obtain rights to use the publicly owned water resources, and the possibility of curtailing (i.e., restricting) some of these water rights in times of shortage. It is important to include an approximation of this water resource regulation and water rights curtailment process in modeling water availability and impacts of water shortages on agricultural production. The overarching objective of this work is to apply an integrated hydrologic-crop-water management modeling framework over the CRB to characterize the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demands, irrigation water availability, water shortages, and associated impacts in the 2030s.\nResults indicate that climate change has both positive and negative effects on agricultural production in the CRB and this varies by region and crop type. Certain watersheds that are already water stressed are projected to experience increasing stress in the future. Although, climate change results in increased water shortages and water rights curtailment in the region, this does not necessarily translate into an increased negative effect on yields; some crops are projected to increase in yield despite curtailment. This could be attributed to higher water use efficiency under elevated CO2 levels as well crops moving through growth stages earlier in the season with wetter and warmer spring conditions. Incorporating regulations into integrated modeling framework results in a more realistic assessment of climate change impacts.",

            "abstract": "The timing of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau has occupied the tectonics community for much of the past quarter century. The effort to elucidate the paleoelevation history has refined a more precise method of estimating paleoaltimetry—coupling stable isotopes (oxygen and deuterium; Rowley et al., 2001) with paleotemperatures derived from Δ47 clumped isotope paleothermometry. However, geologists using this method on the Tibetan Plateau are correctly concerned with the preservation of a primary δ18Ow signal in the thermally altered rocks commonly inherent to collisional zones. Burial by both overlying strata and tectonics can lead to thermal alteration and isotopic resetting, eliminating the possibility of constraining the elevation history using the stable isotope record.\nLin et al. (2014) suggest preservation of a primary depleted oxygen signal in the 55 My carbonates of the Nianbo Fm. and argue against the previously accepted diagenetic resetting of lacustrine and paleosol carbonates found in the Linzhou (Penbo) Basin. The Lin et al. study reports recovery of seasonal isotopic variation in an ostracode using in situ analysis by NanoSIMS, which suggests the host carbonates have not reached sufficiently high temperatures for resetting of the primary δ18O signal. This result prompted further Δ47 analyses at Chicago of Penbo carbonates initially determined to have high paleotemperatures (>60°C) using older, less-refined clumped isotope techniques five years ago. Results of our clumped isotope study will examine whether or not seasonal δ18Oc variations are preserved in the Nianbo Fm. Δ47-derived paleotemperatures will reveal whether the ostracodes preserve an original oxygen signal or are thermally overprinted. The combination of paleotemperatures and δ18Ow will allow for the paleoelevation history of the Tibetan Plateau to be extended to the Eocene using the robust Δ47-derived paleotemperature proxy.",

            "abstract": "In spite of pleas for uncertainty analysis - such as Beven’s (2006) “Should it not be required that every paper in both field and modeling studies attempt to evaluate the uncertainty in the results?” - the uncertainty associated with hydrology and water quality data is rarely quantified and rarely considered in model evaluation. This oversight, justified in the past by mainly tenuous philosophical concerns, diminishes the value of measured data and ignores the environmental and socio-economic benefits of improved decisions and policies based on data with estimated uncertainty. This oversight extends to researchers, who typically fail to estimate uncertainty in measured discharge and water quality data because of additional effort required, lack of adequate scientific understanding on the subject, and fear of negative perception if data with “high” uncertainty are reported; however, the benefits are certain. Furthermore, researchers have a responsibility for scientific integrity in reporting what is known and what is unknown, including the quality of measured data.\nIn response we produced an uncertainty estimation framework and the first cumulative uncertainty estimates for measured water quality data (Harmel et al., 2006). From that framework, DUET-H/WQ was developed (Harmel et al., 2009). Application to several real-world data sets indicated that substantial uncertainty can be contributed by each data collection procedural category and that uncertainties typically occur in order discharge < sediment < dissolved N and P < total N and P.\nSimilarly, modelers address certain aspects of model uncertainty but ignore others, such as the impact of uncertainty in discharge and water quality data. Thus, we developed methods to incorporate prediction uncertainty as well as calibration/validation data uncertainty into model goodness-of-fit evaluation (Harmel and Smith, 2007; Harmel et al., 2010). These enhance model evaluation by: appropriately sharing burden with “data providers”; facilitating more realistic model performance evaluation; better determining model deficiencies (e.g., where simulations do not fall within the uncertainty range of measured data); and more accurately communicating model performance.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the atmosphere and ocean consists of intense and episodic exchanges of heat, momentum, and moisture. However, the way in which these episodic events, and higher-scale frequency events in general, influence the coupled atmosphere/ocean system on longer time scales is not well understood. Models have predicted anthropogenic changes in the mean state and variability of various aspects of the climate which are closely tied to surface turbulent fluxes, but disagree on the nature of the changes. The competing influences of increased humidity, which should reduce fluxes, and increased wind speed and variability, which should increase fluxes, in determining the overall flux under a warming climate is not known. One motivating factor for this research is that there are enormous difficulties in understanding the coupled atmosphere-ocean system, given the complexity of two fluids with large-scale circulations that differ in time/space scales and are coupled through relatively small-scale surface fluxes and cloud processes. In order to make a tractable problem, such statistical techniques as joint distribution analysis, clustering, and variabilities of extremes in time and space must be used to simplify these complex relationships. In order to understand how the climate responds to variations in forcing, one necessary component is to understand the full distribution of variability of exchanges of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and ocean. A number of studies recognize the important role of surface heat and moisture fluxes in the generation and decay of important coupled air-sea phenomena. These mechanisms operate across a number of scales and contain significant contributions from interactions between the anomalous (i.e. non-mean), often extreme-valued, flux components. It is important to have a characterization and understanding of these processes for the development of accurate modeling efforts. In this talk I will make comparisons of some of these analyses between satellite data sets, reanalysis products, and CMIP5 models. By focusing to a large extent on distributional characteristics, and particularly to extremes, comparisons of in situ observations and satellite data sets with distributions from coupled models (e.g. CMIP5) can be made directly.",

            "abstract": "As the world gets warmer and wetter, it is important to identify sentinel systems to resolve the response of ecosystems to climate change across drivers and complex landscapes. Recently developed climate forcing optical indices (CFOI) related to the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been shown to be scalable from short-term storm events to interdecadal periods in diverse lakes in lowland landscapes. Are these CFOI metrics effective in alpine ecosystems, which are often viewed as more responsive sentinels of climate change than lowland ecosystems? DOC-related optical data from a series of alpine lakes in North America are used here to address this question. The response of these CFOI metrics followed the same tight relationship in alpine lakes as in lowland lakes, with a seasonal increase in spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm (S275-295) and a decrease in DOC-specific absorbance at 320 nm (a*320) as well as in the ratio of these two indices (a*320/S275-295, a composite climate forcing index, CF). These changes are likely driven largely by photobleaching of terrestrial DOC during the ice-free season. Closer analysis of five years of data for Lake Oesa in the Canadian Rockies revealed marginally significant relationships between precipitation and the CFOI metrics. Specifically, S275-295 decreased with increasing cumulative precipitation for the 15 day period preceding water sample collection. a*320 increased with cumulative precipitation for the 45 day period preceding water sample collection. Relationships between CFOI metrics and precipitation at other time scales were not significant. While the DOC-quality related CFOI metrics were responsive to precipitation, DOC concentration alone was not. The time scale of precipitation effects on CFOI metrics in Lake Oesa was shorter than those previously observed for lowland lakes. This contrasting response is likely related to differences in the characteristics of the hydrology and catchments of lowland lakes vs. that of Oesa which is largely covered by ice, rock, and glacial till rather than the extensive vegetation found at lower elevations. These optical changes in alpine lakes in response to precipitation may have important ecological implications for the differences in how alpine vs. lower elevation systems respond to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Changing climate, including warmer temperatures and drought conditions, has intensified mountain pine beetle infestation in the Rocky Mountains of North America, resulting in tree death over the last decade that is unprecedented in recorded history. The subsequent perturbation to tree-scale water budget processes such as interception, transpiration, and evaporation often combine non-uniformly and produce variable catchment-scale responses. Potentially offsetting perturbations such as decreased transpiration with tree death and increased exposure and evaporation with needle fall can produce changes in peak streamflow and water yield that are undetectable above typical interannual variability. These combined perturbations, however, may change streamflow generating processes and water sources that impact water quality in important mountain headwater streams. To determine the potential impact of widespread land cover change on catchment contributions to streamflow, this study combines a chemical and isotopic separation analysis using paired watersheds and pre-infestation controls with a multi-scale modeling approach (from hillslope to headwaters systems) that determines changes in water stores and fluxes between canopy, land-surface, groundwater and streamflow. Field observations and chemical hydrograph separation analysis suggest that groundwater contributions to streamflow increase with recent insect infestation, as transpiration ceases to remove water from the subsurface but potentially increased ground evaporation removes water from the land and subsurface with relative uniformity. Comparing these field observations to hillslope models provides additional spatial and temporal controls on inherently challenging field heterogeneities as well as a way of testing the influence of natural properties such as precipitation and topography on perturbations to streamflow partitioning from insect infestation. At larger scales, watershed models demonstrate how other factors may compensate to mute these responses between stand, hillslope and watershed scale. Ultimately, identifying these changes in stream water sources provides needed insight for water resource management in MPB-infested watersheds and for changing forested landscapes throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "Phenology, the timing of recurring life cycle events, controls numerous land surface feedbacks to the climate system through the regulation of exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. Vegetation phenology is affected by climate change and weather variability. It is widely established that warmer temperatures lead to earlier spring onset and might lead to delayed autumn senescence in temperate and boreal ecosystems, while water controls the phenology patterns in arid and Mediterranean ecosystems.\nDespite increasing understanding of the main drivers of phenological events, terrestrial biosphere models are known to have systematic errors in the simulation of spring phenology, which potentially could propagate to uncertainty in modeled responses to future climate change.\nThis is mainly due to misparameterization, model structural errors, and missing processes in phenology models..\nHere, we use different data streams collected over spatial gradients in North America and Europe to investigate and characterize the sources of model uncertainty. By using a model-data fusion approach, we combined information from phenological observations of different woody species, with 12 leaf bud-burst models that varied in complexity.\nWe discuss the uncertainty associated with model parameterization and with the climate drivers used to forecast phenology. Moreover, we discuss the differences in model selection (forcing, chilling, and photoperiod) and parameterizations when the models are applied to the same woody species along the gradients.\nFinally we evaluate other potential biological controls (e.g. foliar stoichiometry, maximum rates of photosynthesis at saturating irradiance at ecosystem level) on plant phenology by evaluating the model residuals against a variety of plant traits.",

            "abstract": "The updated status of TEMPO, as it proceeds from formulation phase into implementation phase is presented. TEMPO, the first NASA Earth Venture Instrument, will measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO measures from Mexico City to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution. TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry. Measurements are from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the inherent high variability in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies.\nTEMPO takes advantage of a GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve O3, NO2, SO2, H2CO, C2H2O2, H2O, aerosols, cloud parameters, and UVB radiation. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O3 in the lowermost troposphere, reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions by 50%. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides near-real-time air quality products that will be made widely, publicly available.\nTEMPO provides much of the atmospheric measurement capability recommended for GEO-CAPE in the 2007 National Research Council Decadal Survey, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond. GEO-CAPE is not planned for implementation this decade. However, instruments from Europe (Sentinel 4) and Asia (GEMS) will form parts of a global GEO constellation for pollution monitoring later this decade, with a major focus on intercontinental pollution transport. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be a component of this constellation",

            "abstract": "With the advent of long image time series as a part of the emerging earth observing system, it is now possible to examine the geographic distribution of trends in seasonal change. However, image time series of earth phenomena exhibit many forms of variability that detract from the signal of interest including cloud contamination, path radiance and short term inter- and intra-annual variability. To accommodate this, a special procedure called Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA) was developed that uses a combination of harmonic analysis and robust statistical trend measurement to reduce the effects of noise and short-term variability. A Contextual Mann-Kendall test is then used to test the trends associated with each of five harmonic shape parameters developed by STA. A three-class categorization of significance then leads to 243 possible classes of seasonal trend. In a study of a 30-year series of global monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index imagery (GIMMS NDVI3g, 1982-2011), it was found that over half (56.30%) of vegetated land surfaces exhibited significant trends in seasonality. Further, almost half (46.10%) of these significant trends belonged to just three classes of seasonal trends. Class 1 consisted of areas that experienced a uniform increase in NDVI throughout the year, and was primarily associated with forest biomes. Class 2 was predominantly associated with grassland and shrubland biomes and exhibited increases in the amplitude of the annual seasonal signal without a net annual change. Class 3 exhibited increases in the annual summer peak in NDVI and was found primarily in the Taiga and Tundra biomes. While no single attribution could be established for each of these classes, they point to a widespread greening of vegetated surfaces associated with climate-related ameliorations of growing conditions.",

            "abstract": "Society is increasingly recognizing the value of stream ecosystem functions, as evidenced by the enormous economic investment being made in stream restoration across the United States. Stream restoration projects have a variety of goals, including improvement in water quality and in-stream habitat. Popular approaches to restoration (such as Natural Channel Design, or NCD) aim to move degraded streams along a trajectory toward a dynamic ecological endpoint that represents natural conditions. Project designs primarily focus on channel form and function, but stream-groundwater exchanges of water and solutes are not typically a design consideration, although a primary component of fully functioning stream ecosystems. Here, we synthesize results from field investigations of the impact of NCD stream restoration on stream-groundwater exchanges by (1) comparing restored sites to reference reaches, which serve as the basis for the restoration design, (2) characterizing multiple restored sites to determine universal characteristics of streams restored by NCD, and (3) monitoring a stream pre- and post- restoration. NCD restoration creates hot spots of rapid hyporheic exchange upstream of channel spanning structures, with water fluxes across the bed interface up to an order of magnitude higher than at pre-restoration or reference reaches. Elevated flux rates result in short hyporheic residence times, which are not sufficiently long to generate net changes in nutrient concentrations. Hot spots of biogeochemical transformations are instead located around secondary bedforms, such as pool-riffle sequences, where gross water exchange rates are more moderate. ",

Few field methods are available for quantifying variability of hydrologic exchange rates across the streambed interface through space and time at high resolution. Advances in heat tracing provide opportunities for improved assessment of the paired spatial and temporal structure of heterogeneity in water flux and chemistry in the hyporheic zone. Here, we present a synthesis of heat transport monitoring and modeling studies aimed at improving spatial and temporal characterization of water exchange across the bed interface. Hot spots of water and solute exchange at the bed interface are quantified in the field at the reach scale by integrating high-resolution streambed temperature maps with point measurements of water flux inferred from 1D temperature profiles. The effectiveness and potential errors of this methodology are explored through numerical groundwater flow and heat transport modeling. Hot moments of water and solute exchange are quantified in the field using high-resolution distributed temperature sensing, paired with 1D heat transport modeling and detailed water quality profiles. The effectiveness and potential errors of quantifying temporal variability in water flux using heat tracing are explored through controlled laboratory experiments. Our results demonstrate the enormous potential for using heat tracing to quantify spatial and temporal changes in water flux across the bed interface at high resolution. The methods presented take advantage of inexpensive temperature sensors and user-friendly modeling methods, such as VFLUX, making heat tracing a good option for field practitioners interested in observing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water flux at the bed interface.",

            "abstract": "Advancements in computing power have created new opportunities for the use of numerical models in wildfire research. Models like the Wildland Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) and FIRETEC attempt to represent interactions between the dominant processes that determine wildfire behavior such as convective and radiative heat transfer, aerodynamic drag and buoyant response of the atmosphere to heat released by the fire. Such models are not practical for operational faster-than-real-time fire prediction due to their computational and data requirements. However, their process-based model-development approach creates an opportunity to provide additional perspectives concerning aspects of fire behavior that have been observed in the field and in the laboratory, allow for sensitivity analysis that is impractical through observations and pose new hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Specific examples of the use of FIRETEC in this fashion include: 1) investigation of the 3D fire/atmosphere interaction that dictates multiscale fireline dynamics; 2) the influence of vegetation heterogeneity and variability in wind fields on predictability of fire spread; 3) the interaction between ecosystem disturbances such as insect attacks and potential fire behavior; and 4) the effects of nonlocal topography. Numerical studies support new conceptual models for the dominant roles of multi-scale fluid dynamics in determining the nature and viability of fire spread. Results from these studies highlight the critical roles of upwind buoyancy-induced vorticity and crosswind fireline-intensity variations on heat transfer to unburned fuels, the influence of canopy structure on convective heating and cooling of canopy fuels and the impact of heterogeneous vegetation distribution/aggregation on wind penetration into canopies and crown fire behavior. There needs to be continued efforts to meet the challenges of validating the results from these numerical investigations with lab experiments and field observations, but, even so, they help progress wildfire science by suggesting relationships, interactions and phenomenology that should be considered in the context of the interpretation of observations, design of fire behavior experiments and development of new operational models.",

The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (UN-ISDR) adopted HFA in January 2005 in order to reduce disaster risk. As an instrument to compare the risk due to different natural hazards, an integrated worldwide study was implemented and published in several Global Assessment Reports (GAR) by UN-ISDR. The results of the global earthquake induced tsunami hazard and exposure analysis for a return period of 500 years are presented. Both deterministic and probabilistic methods (PTHA) are used. The resulting hazard levels for both methods are compared quantitatively for selected areas. The comparison demonstrates that the analysis is rather rough, which is expected for a study aiming at average trends on a country level across the globe. It is shown that populous Asian countries account for the largest absolute number of people living in tsunami prone areas, more than 50% of the total exposed people live in Japan. Smaller nations like Macao and the Maldives are among the most exposed by population count. Exposed nuclear power plants are limited to Japan, China, India, Taiwan, and USA.\nOn the contrary, a local tsunami vulnerability and risk analysis applies information on population, building types, infrastructure, inundation, flow depth for a certain tsunami scenario with a corresponding return period combined with empirical data on tsunami damages and mortality. Results and validation of a GIS tsunami vulnerability and risk assessment model are presented. The GIS model is adapted for optimal use of data available for each study.

However, agricultural applications at field scale require finer spatial resolution remote sensing data. Landsat (30-m) data have been successfully used for agricultural applications. There are many medium resolution sensors available today or in near future. These include Landsat, SPOT, RapidEye, ASTER and future Sentinel-2 etc. Approaches have been developed in the past several years to integrate remote sensing data from different sensors which may have different sensor characteristics, and spatial and temporal resolutions. This allows us opportunities today to map crop growth stages and conditions using dense time-series remote sensing at field scales.\nHowever, remotely sensed phenology (or phenological metrics) is normally derived based on the mathematical functions of the time-series data. The phenological metrics are determined by either identifying inflection (curvature) points or some pre-defined thresholds in the remote sensing phenology algorithms. Furthermore, physiological crop growth stages may not be directly correlated to the remotely sensed phenology. The relationship between remotely sensed phenology and crop growth stages is likely to vary for specific crop types and varieties, growing stages, conditions and even locations. In this presentation, we will examine the relationship between remotely sensed phenology and crop growth stages using in-situ measurements from Fluxnet sites and crop progress reports from USDA NASS. We will present remote sensing approaches and focus on: 1) integrating multiple sources of remote sensing data; and 2) extracting crop phenology at field scales. An example in the U.S. Corn Belt area will be presented and analyzed. Future directions for mapping crop growth stages will be discussed.",

The City of Los Angeles (City) is evaluating plans for individual Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) pollutants in each of its major watersheds. However, it has yet to be studied if implementing individual BMP projects will adequately address water quality objectives for receiving (downstream) water bodies, such as Ballona Creek, Ballona Estuary and the Santa Monica Bay. In addition, there is significant uncertainty surrounding potential ancillary benefits (flood reduction, water supply, green space, etc.) from BMP/LID implementation. This presentation will overview our work with the City evaluating the influence of BMPs and LIDs in improving water quality at the watershed scale as well as quantifying other hydrologic benefits. Multiple BMP scenarios are considered to identify various pathways toward improved receiving water body quality in Ballona Creek and Dominquez watersheds. Specific study objectives are to: 1) identify suites of BMP scenarios which can lead to TMDL compliance, 2) quantify the multiple benefits provided by BMPs beyond their primary water quality improvement purpose, and 3) evaluate the success of using existing software for watershed-scale BMP modeling. Our goal is to provide realistic, implementable pathways that can be used by stakeholders to help plan for future education, outreach and capital improvement programs as well as determine feasible pollutant reduction objectives.",

            "abstract": "The City of Los Angeles relies heavily on external water sources, primarily the Eastern Sierra, Northern California and the Colorado River, and approximately 90% of the City’s water supply is snowpack dependent. In recent years, water conservation measures have been implemented in response to regional drought, which include a tiered pricing structure and watering restrictions. As a result of implemented conservation policies, Los Angeles reported the lowest water consumption per capita per day in 2011 among cities over 1 million people in the U.S. This presentation will highlight our ongoing work to better understand the coupling between humans, ecosystems and water across the City of Los Angeles, especially during the recent drought period. Our work is unique in that we integrate social, ecological, and hydrologic data, including ten years of residential water consumption data for the entire city of Los Angeles, extensive groundwater well data, socio-economic information and remote sensing to evaluate relationships as well as spatial and temporal patterns. Developed statistical models demonstrated that Single-Family Residential (SFR) water use across the City is primarily driven by household income, landscape greenness, water rates and water volume allocation,, with higher consumption rates in the northern, warmer and more affluent parts, and lower consumption rates in the less affluent neighborhoods near Downtown. Landscape use also varies greatly across the city, averaging 50% of total SFR. Our evaluation of conservation efforts shows that the combination of mandatory watering restrictions and price increase led to a water reduction of 23%, while voluntary restrictions led to only a 6% reduction in water use. Relationships of water use to ecosystems (greenness) and groundwater variability were also evaluated and will be highlighted. Our ultimate goal is to improve predictions of human-water interactions in order to drive policy change and guide future demand strategies under uncertain climate variability and a growing urban population.",

            "abstract": "Over geological timescales, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are modulated by exchanges between atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial reservoirs of carbon. Here we investigate whether climate change exerts a first-order control on the delivery of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal ocean by rivers and explore the consequences for the rate of C exchange between atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial reservoirs of C. Specifically, we employ inorganic proxies of sediment source and composition, coupled with stable-isotope and radiocarbon measurements of terrestrial biomarkers delivered to the Bay of Bengal since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to investigate climate-driven changes in the dynamics of terrestrial organic carbon (OC) export and burial in the world’s largest depocenter of sediment and OC.\nCompound-specific stable hydrogen (δD) and carbon (δ13C) isotopic measurements of plant wax compounds from a series of cores from the channel-levee system of the Bengal Fan capture variations in the strength of the Indian summer monsoon and vegetation dynamics within the Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage basin over the past 21 kyrs. Specifically, a 35 ‰ shift in plant wax δD between the LGM and Holocene Climatic Optima, (HCO; 9-5 ka) indicates a change from weaker to stronger monsoon conditions over this time period. Likewise, compound-specific δ13C measurements demonstrate a ca. 4 ‰ shift from the LGM to the HCO, recording a large decline of C4 plants in the basin during this period.\nResidence times of organic matter within the Ganges-Brahmaputra drainage basin determined from compound-specific radiocarbon dating of plant wax compounds vary between ca. 800 and 8000 years over the past 21 kyrs. These calculated residence time show a strong correlation with climate and in particular with the intensity of the summer monsoon as inferred from plant wax δD values. This is illustrated by an order of magnitude decrease in residence time between the driest (Heinrich event 1) and wettest (HCO) intervals of our record. This difference reflects protracted storage of organic matter on land during relatively colder, drier periods. Thus, we have identified climate change as a driver of the rates and sources (e.g., deep soils vs. recent biomass) of terrestrial-OC export from the largest erosional system on earth.",

            "abstract": "Triangular facets are among the most striking landforms associated with normal faulting. The genesis of facets is of great interest both for the information facets contain about tectonic motion, and because the progressive emergence of facets makes them potential recorders of both geomorphic and tectonic history. In this report, we present observations of triangular facets in the western United States and in the Italian Central Apennines. Facets in these regions typically form quasi-planar surfaces that are aligned in series along and above the trace of an active fault. Some facet surfaces consist mainly of exposed bedrock, with a thin and highly discontinuous cover of loose regolith. Other facets are mantled by a several-decimeter-thick regolith cover. Over the course of its morphologic development, a facet slope segment may evolve from a steep (~60 degree) bedrock fault scarp, well above the angle of repose for soil, to a gentler (~20-40 degree) slope that can potentially sustain a coherent regolith cover. This evolutionary trajectory across the angle of repose renders nonlinear diffusion theory inapplicable. To formulate an alternative process-based theory for facet evolution, we use a particle-based approach that acknowledges the possibility for both short- and long-range sediment-grain motions, depending on the topography. The processes of rock weathering, grain entrainment, and grain motion are represented as stochastic state-pair transitions with specified transition rates. The model predicts that facet behavior can range smoothly along the spectrum from a weathering-limited mode to a transport-limited mode, depending on the ratio of fault-slip rate to bare-bedrock regolith production rate. The model also implies that facets formed along a fault with pinned tips should show systematic variation in slope angle that correlates with along-fault position and slip rate. Preliminary observations from central Italy and the eastern Basin and Range are consistent with this prediction.",

Unlike induction currents at bodies surrounded by significant atmospheres, Rhea’s flux tube current system is not driven by motion through the plasma, but rather thermoelectrically, by heat flow into the object. In addition to Rhea, the requirements for the current system are easily satisfied at many plasma absorbing bodies: (1) a difference of average ion and electron gyroradii radii, and (2) a “sharp” body of any size, i.e., without a significant thick atmosphere. This type of current system is therefore expected to occur generally, e.g. at other airless planetary satellites, asteroids, and even spacecraft; and accordingly, represents a fundamental aspect of the physics of the interaction of astrophysical objects with space plasmas.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we address federal wildfire risk management largely through the lens of economics, targeting questions related to costs, effectiveness, efficiency, and tradeoffs. Beyond risks to resources and assets such as wildlife habitat, watersheds, and homes, wildfires present financial risk and budgetary instability for federal wildfire management agencies due to highly variable annual suppression costs. Despite its variability, the costs of wildfire management have continued to escalate and account for an ever-growing share of overall agency budgets, compromising abilities to attain other objectives related to forest health, recreation, timber management, etc. Trends associated with a changing climate and human expansion into fire-prone areas could lead to additional suppression costs in the future, only further highlighting the need for an ability to evaluate economic tradeoffs in investments across the wildfire management spectrum.\nCritically, these economic analyses need to accurately capture the complex spatial and stochastic aspects of wildfire, the inherent uncertainty associated with monetizing environmental impacts of wildfire, the costs and effectiveness of alternative management policies, and linkages between pre-fire investments and active incident management. Investing in hazardous fuels reduction and forest restoration in particular is a major policy lever for pre-fire risk mitigation, and will be a primary focus of our presentation. Evaluating alternative fuel management and suppression policies could provide opportunities for significant efficiency improvements in the development of risk-informed management fire management strategies. Better understanding tradeoffs of fire impacts and costs can help inform policy questions such as how much of the landscape to treat and how to balance investments in treating new areas versus maintaining previous investments. We will summarize current data needs, knowledge gaps, and other factors influencing research and development on this critically important topic. Specifically we will focus on how to embed simulation models within an economic framework, how to link fire models with models of wildfire management expenditures, how to evaluate alternative management policies, and how to measure cost-effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit encountered a remarkable diversity of rocks during its traverse of the Columbia Hills in Gusev crater, manifested both as variations in primary mineralogy and in secondary alteration. The Wishstone and Watchtower Classes represent examples where the less altered (Wishstone) and more altered versions (Watchtower) were recognized as members of an alteration series identified by variations in geochemistry and Fe-bearing mineral phases [1-3]. Work by [1] demonstrated a geochemical relationship consistent with two-component mixing between a high Al2O3, TiO2, CaO, Na2O, P2O5 end-member and a second end-member enriched in MgO, Zn, S, Br, and Cl. The first end-member probably is Wishstone Class, with Watchtower Class intermediate between it and an unrecognized second end-member lithology [1].\nNew results using mirror-dust corrected spectra from Spirit’s Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer [4] affirm the dominant plagioclase component in Wishstone and an amorphous component resembling basaltic glass in Watchtower identified previously [5]. But now we recognize a suite of rocks spanning the full range of alteration, including one dubbed Bruce that appears to be an alteration spectral end-member [4]. The spectra of some rocks with an intermediate level of alteration are well modeled as a simple two-component mixture of Wishstone and Bruce spectra. This is consistent with a style of alteration that progressively obscures spectral contributions of the host rock minerals and is inconsistent with a surface coating. The Bruce spectrum is poorly modeled by primary and secondary phases including phyllosilicates and amorphous silicates. This suggests a style of alteration not recognized in terrestrial settings. Based on the similarity of the Bruce spectrum to TES type 2, this style of alteration may be more widespread on Mars. The conditions that produced this alteration are poorly constrained, hence the relationship to habitability is unknown at this time.\n[1] Hurowitz, J. A., et al. (2006), J. Geophys.

            "abstract": "Deltas are typically treated as binary systems composed of a channel network and the land separating adjacent channels. Field studies of these systems have tended to focus on collecting data either from the channels or from the land, and by doing so have missed a central characteristic of deltas, the connectedness between the land and channels. We propose that the resiliency of any delta can only be accurately assessed if the naturally occurring exchanges of fluid, solids and solutes between the channels and islands (neighboring land) are understood. These exchanges control the growth of land via the deposition of sediment and accumulation of plant biomass, and also affect delta ecology by mediating water temperature and solute concentrations. The deposition of sediment and organic material in turn influences future growth and pattern development for the deltaic channel network. Exchanges between channelized flow in the delta network and the more distributed flow over submerged island tops is currently being monitored and studied at an NSF-funded observatory under development at Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana. Characterization of flow in distributary channels and on island tops reveals that a considerable fraction of water originally travelling in the large channels is transferred onto island tops either through focused entry points (tie channels) or via distributed flow through island-bounding levees. These volume transfer fractions range between 10 and 60 percent, and are sensitive to location within the delta, as well as river discharge, tides, and winds. Island tops develop tributary-like networks through which the fluid, solids, and solutes drain back into adjacent channels or drain out of the system at the front of the delta, in between the mouths of primary distributary channels. Characteristic fluid velocities vary over roughly two orders of magnitude (centimeter- to meter-per-second) depending on whether a fluid parcel is located in shallow laterally unconfined flow on an island top or positioned in a primary channel. We will discuss how these monitored exchanges affect the growth of new land and delta ecology, as well as how overall delta growth influences future exchange of water, solids and solutes between the channels and islands composing this prograding coastal environment.",

            "abstract": "In our continued effort to understand the climate system and improve its representation in general circulation models (GCMs) it is crucial to develop new methods to evaluate these models. This is certainly true as the GCM community advances towards high horizontal resolutions (i.e., grid spacing less than 0.5 degrees), which will require interpreting and improving the performance of many model components. Of specific interest is the role of convective parameterizations at these spatial scales and its impact on tropical dynamics and precipitation processes. Idealized, or reduced complexity, frameworks can be used to investigate how model assumptions impact behavior across scales. A simplified global radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) configuration is proposed to explore the implication of horizontal resolution on equilibrium climate. RCE is the statistical equilibrium in which the radiative cooling of the atmosphere is balanced by heating due to convection and has had a fundamental place in our understanding of the Earth system.\nIn this work, the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5) is configured in RCE to better understand tropical climate and extremes. The RCE setup consists of an ocean-covered earth with diurnally varying, spatially uniform insolation and no rotation effects. CAM5 is run with the spectral element dynamics package at two horizontal resolutions: a standard resolution of approximately 1 degree grid spacing and a high-resolution of approximately 0.25 degree grid spacing. Surface temperature effects are considered by comparing simulations using fixed, uniform sea surface temperature to simulations using an interactive slab ocean model. The various CAM5 configurations provide useful insights into the simulation of tropical climate at the high-resolution, as well as the model’s ability to simulate extreme precipitation events. In particular, the manner in which convection organizes is shown to be dependent on model resolution, as evident by differences in cloud structure, circulation, and precipitation intensity. The use of the interactive slab ocean also impacts convective characteristics, by increasing convective temporal variability and intensity.",

The ideas on how to handle the day-to-day management of data and data systems need to scale with the data and the demand. We have seen the effects of rapid growth spurts at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and anticipate we are not done yet. Looking back, ASF was conceived in 1982 to be a single-purpose imaging radar receiving station supporting a science team focused on geophysical processes. The primary construction at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) was completed in 1988 and full operational status achieved in 1991. The expected supports were estimated at 10 minutes per day and quickly grew to 70 minutes per day. In 1994, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NASA and UAF formed the ASF Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) complementing, the existing agreement for ASF. The demand for the use of ASF as a receiving station and as a data center grew as fast as, and at times faster, than the capabilities.\nLooking forward, as demand drives the system larger just adding on more of the same often complicates rather than simplifies the system. A growing percentage of efforts and resources spent on dealing with problems that originate from a legacy system can creep up on an organization. This in turn limits the ability to keep the overall sustaining costs under control and leads to a crisis. Such growth means more-of-the-same philosophy has to shift into change-or-die philosophy in order to boot strap up to the next level. In this talk, we review how ASF has faced this several times in the past as the volume and demand of data grew along with the technology to acquire and disseminate it. We will look at what is coming for ASF as a data center and what we think are the next steps to stay ahead of the Big Data wave.",

Reconciling these high-order system models with perpetually larger volumes of field data is becoming more and more difficult, particularly because classical likelihood-based fitting methods lack the power to detect and pinpoint deficiencies in the model structure. In this talk I will give an overview of our latest research on process-based model calibration and evaluation. This approach, rooted in Bayesian theory, uses summary metrics of the calibration data rather than the data itself to help detect which component(s) of the model is (are) malfunctioning and in need of improvement. A few case studies involving hydrologic and geophysical models will be used to demonstrate the proposed methodology.",

            "abstract": "Weathering of volcanic rocks plays many important roles at Earth’s surface. U-series isotopes (e.g. 238U-234U-230Th and 232Th) have been demonstrated to be a novel chronometer to constrain the formation rates of weathering rinds on tropical volcanic islands [Pelt et al., 2008, EPSL, 276, 98-105; Ma et al., 2012, GCA 80, 92-107].\nHere, new U-series isotopes and major element concentrations were analyzed in a basaltic-andesite weathering rind collected from the relatively dry side (northern) of the tropical Basse-Terre Island, Guadeloupe. Core and rind samples were drilled across low, medium and high curvature segments of the core-rind boundary and the measured (238U/232Th) and (230Th/232Th) activity ratios range from 1.024 to 1.390, and 1.007 to 1.186, respectively. Both (238U/232Th) and (230Th/232Th) ratios increase systematically from the core into the weathering rind, similar to those observed previously in the well-characterized weathering rind of the Bras David watershed, located on the central wet part of Basse-Terre [Ma et al., 2012]. We suggest that similar mechanisms controlled the evolution of U-series isotope compositions of the new weathering clast: 1) an influx of soil solution carries dissolved U with (234U/238U) activity ratios >1 into the clast, responsible for the observed gradual increase of (238U/232Th) activity ratios in the rind; and 2) subsequent production and accumulation of 230Th in the rind over time from the decay of excess 234U and 238U account for the observed continuous increase of (230Th/232Th) activity ratios.\nWeathering advance rates of this new clast calculated with the U-series activity ratios are ~0.1-0.2 mm kyr-1. These preliminary rates are lower than the clast weathering advance rate (~0.3 mm kyr-1) previously determined for the Bras David watershed. Such a difference may be attributed to less precipitation in the northern region of the island (~1800 mm yr-1), compared to the Bras David watershed (~3000 mm yr-1). This study illustrates a new case study where weathering advance rates of rinds are successfully estimated by using U-series isotopes. Furthermore, the application of U-series chronometry in chemical weathering and rind formation will also be useful in measuring the importance of precipitation on weathering at the clast scale.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the largest natural source of atmospheric methane. Static chambers have been used to quantify variation in wetland CH4 flux for many decades. Regional to global scale synthesis studies of static chamber measurements show that relationships between temperature, water availability and CH4 emissions depend on wetland type (bog, fen, swamp), region (tropical, temperate, arctic) and disturbance. For example, while water table position and temperature serve as the dominant controls on bog and swamp CH4 flux, vegetation is an important control on emissions from fens. These studies highlight the fact that wetland types have distinct controls on CH4 emissions; however, it is unlikely that modeling of wetland CH4 flux will improve without a better mechanistic understanding of the processes underlying CH4 production, transport, and oxidation.\nAt the Alaska Peatland Experiment, we are quantifying CH4 emission using static chambers, automated chambers, and towers. Our sites vary in permafrost regime, including groundwater fens without permafrost, forested peat plateaus with intact permafrost, and collapse scar bogs formed through permafrost thaw. Experimental studies that examine plant and microbial responses to altered water table position and soil temperature are complemented by a gradient approach, where we use a space-for-time substitutions to examine the consequences of thaw on time-scales of decades to centuries. Our results thus far have documented the importance of soil rewetting in governing large CH4 fluxes from northern wetland soils. Accounting for CH4, our collapse scar bog significantly contributed to the global warming potential of the landscape. A major objective of our work is to explore the role of permafrost C release in greenhouse gas fluxes from wetland soils, which we are assessing using radiocarbon as a natural tracer. We have shown, for example, that ebullition of CH4 is dominated by recently fixed C, but a significant fraction of CH4 in bubbles is derived from old C released during thaw. The APEX time series datasets are being used in a variety of modeling studies, from small-scale soil pore and microbial controls on gas production and transport to regional scale assessments of how carbon cycle feedbacks to climate vary with wetland type and abundance.",

            "abstract": "Warming over the last several decades has led to an upward or poleward shift in the distributional limit of trees at sites around the circumboreal north. In our own research in three regions in Alaska, we found evidence for an upward shift in treeline at every site, in the form of a decline in population age with increasing elevation. The prevalence of that particular signature of change suggests that continued expansion of forest vegetation at treeline is likely. But how fast, and how sustained are those changes likely to be in the future? Changing disturbance regimes, non-linear growth responses to warming, and unexplained regional variability in the rate of historical responses to warming all introduce significant uncertainty to projections of future change at treeline. In an effort to compare historical with current patterns of change, we set up permanent plots in each of the sites at which we had reconstructed forest history, tagging each tree and seedling. We resampled these plots more than a decade after the initial measurements, and thus have an opportunity to compare the actual trajectory of change in each plot with the trajectory that we inferred from our dendrochronological reconstructions. At most sites, the observed pattern of change over the last 10-15 years is consistent with the trajectory inferred from dendrochronological studies. Seedling density at treeline and above treeline increased significantly over this time period-- almost doubling (98.6% increase) at treeline plots, and increasing more than 189%, on average, in above treeline plots. The expansion of forest vegetation at treeline has thus continued at an extremely rapid pace. The remeasurements also, however, yielded surprises that could not have been anticipated from the reconstructions at forest history. A severe fire at one of our sites killed most of the seedlings that had established above treeline, and in the years since the fire, aspen-- which is not a common treeline species in Alaska-- has become the dominant woody vegetation both at and above treeline at this site. This suggests that changes in disturbance regime at treeline could have unexpected consequences-- leading to rapid establishment of vegetation types that are not currently common at treeline.",

            "abstract": "Neogene climate reflects the transition into a colder, more variable world dominated by the onset and intensification of major Northern Hemisphere glaciations. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 recovered a cross-margin transect of pelagic facies from this subarctic, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll modern setting to glacigenic material from the exhuming coastal mountains. The recovered sedimentary record extends from the late Miocene through the Pleistocene/Holocene. Shipboard results indicate a ~doubling in sediment accumulation rates at ~2.56 Ma at the deep-water distal Site U1417, which is interpreted as the onset of significant glacial coverage in the St. Elias Range after the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, resulting in the start of deposition in the Surveyor Fan. At all sites, clast-rich mud and/or diamict are prevalent in the Pleistocene, indicating the persistent transport of glacigenic sediment by ice, iceberg or sea-ice rafting. An unanticipated observation is the often sharp transitions between these ice-dominated facies and more biogenic-rich, often bioturbated, muddy lithologies that might be related to increased biological productivity, enhanced nutrient supply, and/or decreased input of terrigenous sediments. All sites contained variable preservation of biosiliceous and calcareous microfossils that indicate dynamic water column productivity and/or variable sediment geochemistry from the late Miocene to the present. At deep-water sites, strong variations in environmentally sensitive planktic foraminifera, radiolarians, and diatoms record alternating warming and cooling intervals during the last 1.2 Ma. At Site U1417, planktic foraminifera and radiolarian taxa abundances indicate cooler conditions in the Pleistocene relative to the Pliocene/late Miocene. Especially high sedimentation rates during the late Pleistocene hold promise for future studies related to suborbital-scale variability in paleoproductivity and glacigenic sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "Phenology has been shown to be a robust integrator of the effects of year-to-year climate variability and longer-term climate change on natural systems. At the level of organisms, phenology plays a critical role in processes related to growth, reproduction, and competition. At the level of ecosystems, phenology is important because of implications for productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and feedbacks to the climate system. At decadal-to-century time scales, climate change will indirectly cause additional shifts in ecosystem phenology via shifts in community composition and structure.\nThere is a demonstrated need to better document biological responses to a changing world, and improved phenological monitoring will contribute to achieving this goal. In this talk, I will describe a collaborative research network called “PhenoCam” (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/). PhenoCam uses networked digital cameras – webcams – for phenological monitoring in a range of ecosystems (over 100 sites, and 300+ site-years of archived data) across the North American continent. These sites range from coastal wetlands of the southeast to mountain highlands of the northwest, and from the hot deserts of Arizona to the cold of arctic Alaska. Images are captured every 30 minutes, are uploaded to the PhenoCam server for display in real-time, and are then processed to yield measures of vegetation greenness.\nI will discuss how we are using data from PhenoCam (1) to improve understanding of the environmental controls on phenology at organism-to-ecosystem scales; (2) to relate ecosystem processes (e.g. carbon and water fluxes measured via eddy covariance) to phenology; and (3) to develop predictive models and forecast future climate change impacts on phenology.",

            "abstract": "Ice clouds play a key role in the Earth’s radiation budget, mostly through their strong regulation of infrared radiation exchange. Submillimeter wave remote sensing offers a unique capability to improve cloud ice measurements from space. At 874 GHz cloud scattering produces a larger brightness temperature depression from cirrus than lower frequencies, which can be used to retrieve vertically-integrated cloud ice water path (IWP) and ice particle size. The objective of the IceCube project is to retire risks of 874-GHz receiver technology by raising its TRL from 5 to 7. The project will demonstrate, on a 3-U CubeSat in a low Earth orbit (LEO) environment, the 874-GHz receiver system with noise equivalent differential temperature (NEDT) of ~0.2 K for 1-second integration and calibration error of 2.0 K or less as measured from deep-space observations. The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is partnering with Virginia Diodes, Inc (VDI) to qualify commercially available 874-GHz receiver technology for spaceflight, and demonstrate the radiometer performance. The instrument (submm-wave cloud radiometer, or SCR), along with the CubeSat system developed and integrated by GSFC, will be ready for launch in two years. The instrument subsystem includes a reflector antenna, sub-millimeter wave mixer, frequency multipliers and stable local oscillator, an intermediate frequency (IF) circuit with noise injection, and data-power boards. The mixer and frequency multipliers are procured from VDI with GSFC insight into fabrication and testing processes to ensure scalability to spaceflight beyond TRL 7. The remaining components are a combination of GSFC-designed and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) at TRLs of 5 or higher. The spacecraft system is specified by GSFC and comprises COTS components including three-axis stabilizer and sun sensor, GPS receiver, deployable solar arrays, UHF radio, and 2 GB of on-board storage. The spacecraft and instrument are integrated and flight qualified through environmental testing at GSFC. The concept of operations is to fly the GSFC designed instrument/spacecraft in a LEO orbit and collect the 874-GHz radiance data for a period of at least 28+ days. Communication will be through the WFF’s UHF ground station. Mission Operations and data processing and validation will be conducted at GSFC.",

            "abstract": "The critical zone, which extends from the top of the canopy to the elevation of unweathered bedrock, hosts a variety of processes that control the evolution of the topographic surface. Though studies of hillslope evolution tend to focus on erosion and soil production mechanisms near the surface, evidence suggests that weathering and fluid transport processes that occur at depths beyond the soil influence hillslope form. Despite this, little is known about what controls the boundary between weathered and fresh bedrock (Zb) under hillslopes and few direct observations of Zb and moisture dynamics within weathered rock exist. This study presents observations from a heavily monitored 4000 m2 experimental hillslope within the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory in northern California. Drilling data, groundwater monitoring, and geophysical imaging reveal a weathered bedrock zone that thickens towards the divide and is consistent with a theory for predicting Zb under hillslopes that links channel incision to the drainage of fresh bedrock within the hillslope. Direct observations of rock moisture indicate that moisture dynamics within weathered rock regulate streamflow and transpiration. Water transport in the weathered bedrock occurs via two mechanisms: a diffuse wetting front and rapid transport along fractures. This water recharges a seasonally perched water table that provides baseflow. Rock moisture storage increases upslope and remains seasonally elevated longer into the dry season of this Mediterranean climate suggesting that Zb and the spatial distribution of weathered rock controls the spatial and temporal moisture dyanmics in hillslopes. Data from vegetative water use monitoring efforts suggest that rock moisture influences forest ecosystem dynamics and thus physical weathering, erosion mechanisms, climate (via transpiration), and baseflow. Our observations within the interior of this hillslope highlight the consequences of critical zone evolution on the mechanisms that influence hillslope form.",

            "abstract": "Construction and operation of large dams in river basins have trapped large volumes of freshwater and sediment, which not only alters the natural seasonal rhythm of river hydrological cycles, but also creates a disconnection between rivers and their deltas. As a result, the water and sediment discharged to the coastal ocean have been greatly reduced, which triggers profound responses in coastal region including delta destruction, accelerated rise of relative sea level and changes in coastal primary production. The Yellow River has been a well documented system with significant impacts of dam regulation. Recent sediment load and freshwater (2002-2012) delivered to the sea have been reduced to 0.16 billion tones per year and 17.9 km3/yr, approximately 13% and 34% of those in 1950s-1960s, a period without significant dam impacts. Dam interception and dam-facilitated water regulation play a dominated role in reducing the flux of water and sediment to the sea, as well as in changing the grain-size composition of sediment. Consequently, the process of estuarine sediment dynamics has changed and the delta has recently been converted into a destructive phase with strong coastal erosion due to insufficient rive sediment supply although the accretion of the active delta lobe was evident because of rapid local deposition of coarsening river sediment around the river mouth. The delta coast erosion has thus become a major source for sediment transport in the Bohai Sea and even to those in the Yellow Sea given the critical role of monsoonal climate on coastal resuspension and coastal currents. Delta erosion and subsidence have therefore accelerated the rate of relative sea-level rise, considerably higher than the global mean, which has put the mega-delta to be at risk. In addition, recent works have identified two peaks of chlorophyll-a within annual cycle in the delta coastal region, one of which is closely associated with the river delivery of nutrients transferred with freshwater and sediment. This implied a significant decrease in coastal primary production resulting from the reduction of river water and sediment. Therefore, the coastal ecosystem in the delta region is expected to be greatly altered given the combined effects of decreasing primary production and destruction of coastal wetland due to the enhanced coastal erosion.",

            "abstract": "Low temperature dolomite formation continues to be an enigmatic process. However, with the advent of the clumped isotope technique, there is an opportunity to determine the temperature of formation as well as the δ18O of the fluid (δ18Ow) from which it formed. By using samples with a well constrained geologic and thermal history, we have attempted to accurately develop a technique for the application of clumped isotopes to varying dolomite systems.\nSamples for this study were taken from two cores, one from the island of San Salvador and one on Great Bahama Bank (known as Clino), located on the eastern and western edges respectively of the Bahamian Archipelago. Both cores penetrate through Pleistocene to Miocene aged carbonates. The San Salvador core has a 110m section of pure, near stoichiometric dolomite, while the Clino core is of a mixed carbonate composition with varying abundances (0% - 50%) of calcian dolomite (42-46 mol % MgCO3). The water temperature profile of the Bahamas can be assumed over time due to the stable geology and no influence of higher temperature waters. Because of its location and the present burial depth, the largest influence on dolomite formation has been changes in sea level.\nAs the dolomites from San Salvador are 100% dolomite, the Δ47 was determined directly. The Clino dolomites however were only partially dolomitized and so were treated with buffered acetic acid to remove non-dolomite carbonates. This was carried out in stages, using X-ray diffraction to determine composition, followed by the measurement of Δ47 after each leaching episode. Because the dolomite formation temperature and δ18Ow can be constrained, it becomes possible to evaluate the applicability of the multitude of clumped isotope correction schemes that have been applied to various dolomite samples. Also tested were several different equations which link temperature to the δ18O of the dolomite allowing the δ18O of the water to be calculated. This is a necessary exercise for the study of dolomite because of the inability to properly standardize low temperature dolomite formation as well as the novelty of the clumped isotope technique. In doing so, we hope to establish accurate protocols in how to best handle low temperature dolomite clumped isotope data.",

For example, what is the impact of the Columbia River project’s 2,700 km^2 irrigated area (applying approximately 300 m^3/s) on the down-wind continental rainfall in North America? Similarly, can we identify places on earth where planting large-scale runoff-reducing forests might increase down-wind precipitation, thus leading to magnified carbon capture? In this talk we present an analytical Lagrangian framework for the prediction of incremental increases in down-wind precipitation due to land surface evaporation and transpiration. We compare these predictions to recently published rainfall recycling values from the literature. Focus is on the Columbia basin (Pacific Northwest of hte USA), with extensions to East Africa. We further explore the monitoring requirements for verification of any such impact, and see if the planned TAHMO African Observatory (TAHMO.org) has the potential to document any such processes over the 25-year and 1,000 km scales.",

            "abstract": "International collaborative exploration over the last decade has revealed East Antarctica as a geologically diverse continent underlying an ice sheet with significant sea level potential, parts of which are currently undergoing rapid change. The Wilkes and Aurora Subglacial Basins (WSB and ASB), two of the largest reservoirs of sea level potential in Antarctica, are broader, deeper, and more susceptible to marine ice sheet instability than previously known. The morphology and coastal connections of the ASB indicate a dynamic early ice sheet with a significant erosional history and multiple ice sheet configurations. Recent results imply significant retreat into the WSB during the Pliocene while today irreversible discharge there is halted by only a small ridge.\nWe have unveiled complex contemporary subglacial landscapes beneath both basins providing new challenges and opportunities to ice sheet modelers. For instance, geothermal heat flow varies spatially on multiple scales in the continental crust assumed to be homogeneous. A large, active, subglacial hydrological system flows through the ASB along pathways that likely predate large-scale glaciation.\nProxies indicate four to eight meters of global sea level rise during the last interglacial period. Ice core results constrain the amount of sea level rise to one to three meters from contributed by East Antarctica. Going forward, new altimetry data along the East Antarctic coast reveal extensive lowering of the Totten and Denman Glaciers while satellite gravity indicate a variable but persistent record of negative regional mass loss. These discoveries provide a new baseline as the international community increases its focus on the region through ongoing airborne and marine exploration to address the many outstanding questions:\nWhat is the character and distribution of subglacial boundary conditions and water systems upstream of the grounding line in areas of significant potential sea level impact?\nHow much subglacial water discharges into sub-ice shelf cavities and what is its impact on the ocean?\nHow do ocean forcings drive variations in ice surface elevation change and grounded ice mass budget?\nHow does ice shelf cavity geometry affect sub-ice shelf circulation, and melt/freeze distribution in areas of significant potential sea level impact?",

            "abstract": "The carbon-climate community has an historic opportunity to make a step-function improvement in climate prediction by using regional constraints to improve mechanistic model representation of carbon cycle processes. Interactions among atmospheric CO2, global biogeochemistry, and physical climate constitute leading sources of uncertainty in future climate. First-order differences among leading models of these processes produce differences in climate as large as differences in aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions and fossil fuel combustion. Emergent constraints based on global observations of interannual variations provide powerful constraints on model parameterizations. Additional constraints can be defined at regional scales. Organized intercomparison experiments have shown that uncertainties in future carbon-climate feedback arise primarily from model representations of the dependence of photosynthesis on CO2 and drought stress and the dependence of decomposition on temperature. Just as representations of net carbon fluxes have benefited from eddy flux, ecosystem manipulations, and atmospheric CO2, component carbon fluxes (photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, disturbance) can be constrained at regional scales using new observations. Examples include biogeochemical tracers such as isotopes and carbonyl sulfide as well as remotely-sensed parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass. Innovative model evaluation experiments will be needed to leverage the information content of new observations to improve process representations as well as to provide accurate initial conditions for coupled climate model simulations. Successful implementation of a comprehensive benchmarking program could have a huge impact on understanding and predicting future climate change.",

Calculated catchment-weighted evaporation losses based on a lake survey in the 1990s were estimated at ~10–15% in tundra areas draining into the Arctic Ocean to as high as 60% in forested subarctic areas draining to the Mackenzie River via Great Bear or Great Slave Lakes. Open-water evaporation was found to generally decrease with increasing latitude, accounting for 5 to 50% of total evapotranspiration. Two long-term studies initiated in the 1990s, and carried on for 20+ years, confirm many of the findings of the initial survey and now provide a complimentary perspective of temporal variations in water balance along two representative string-of-lakes drainages located in boreal and tundra settings. For a tundra watershed, the study reveals important lake-order-dependent patterns of evaporation/inflow, evaporation/evapotranspiration, land-surface-runoff/precipitation and discharge/precipitation. For a boreal watershed, the analysis also reveals that fluctuations in effective drainage area due to intermittent connectivity between lakes during dry periods can be an important driver of downstream isotopic signals.",

Kailas to the west were collected for detrital zircon U-Pb geochronologic and Apatite Fission Track (AFT) thermochronologic analyses. Zircon U-Pb ages for all rivers range between 15 and 3568 Ma. Rivers draining the northern side of the suture zone mainly yield ages between 40 and 60 Ma, similar to the age of the Gangdese magmatic arc. Samples from rivers draining the southern side of the suture zone record a Tethyan Himalayan signal characterized by age clusters at 500 Ma and 1050 Ma. Our results indicate that the ages and proportion of U-Pb zircons ages of downstream samples from tributaries of the Yarlung River directly reflect source area ages and relative area of source rock exposure in the catchment basin. Significant age components at 37 – 40 Ma, 47 – 50 Ma, 55 – 58 Ma and 94 – 97 Ma reflect episodicity in Gangdese arc magmatism. Our AFT ages show two main signals at 23–18 Ma and 12 Ma, which are in agreement with accelerated exhumation of the Gangdese batholith during these time intervals. The 23 – 18 Ma signal partly overlaps with deposition of the Kailas Formation along the suture zone and may be related to exhumation due to upper plate extension in southern Tibet in response to Indian slab rollback and/or break–off events.\nDetrital thermochronology of four sand samples from the Kali Gandaki River and some of its tributaries in Nepal is underway and will provide constraints on the timing of erosion of the central Nepal Himalaya.",

A significant fraction of this dipole trend pattern has been attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a large-scale mode of internal climate variability. However, the PDO cannot fully account for the Western Pacific Ocean trend pattern. Whether or not the remaining non-PDO pattern can be linked to an anthropogenic influence has been discussed in several recent studies. Here, we use a large ensemble of CMIP5 20th century simulations (more than 150 runs from 27 different GCM setups) to further investigate the role and contribution of the PDO and other modes of equatorial variability to Pacific sea level change patterns. Specifically, we focus on 20-year trend patterns since 1950, and attempt to isolate and attribute an externally forced sea level pattern. Rather than averaging over the large CMIP5 model ensemble to dampen non-synchronized internal variability, we remove sea level trend contributions from internal variability to test if the remaining patterns become more consistent across the models, and thus support the notion of a detectable common externally forced sea level change since 1990. Our results also indicate that the representation of the PDO and its link to large-scale regional sea level variations can differ significantly across the CMIP5 ensemble. While some CMIP5 models can replicate observed connections between PDO-related and equatorial climate modes and Pacific sea level patterns, others show large differences.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotellurics (MT) provides a powerful geophysical tool for imaging of ancient suture zones, which are frequently marked by elongated zones of very low resistivity. These conductive anomalies, which can extend to great depths and have apparently persisted for several billion years, most likely result from graphite and sulfides deeply emplaced and remobilized, through subduction, accretion and orogenesis. The Earthscope MT transportable array provides a unique broad-scale view of sutures in the continental US. In the northwestern US subvertical conductive features bound all of the major cratonic blocks. These can be identified with the Cheyenne Belt between the Wyoming Craton (WC) and Yavapai Terranes (YT), the Great Falls Tectonic Zone between WC and the Medicine Hat Block (MHB), and the Vulcan Structure of southern Alberta between MHB and the Hearne Craton. In all cases the conductive anomalies extend well into the mantle lithosphere. The more recent MT TA footprint in the north-central US (surrounding the Mid-Continent Rift (MCR)) also reveals conductive signatures of ancient sutures. The most prominent lies south of Lake Superior, just north of the Niagara Fault (NF), and can be associated with the Penokean Orogeny (~1.85 Ga). A second, further south beneath Iowa and western Wisconsin, just south of the Spirit Lake tectonic zone (SLtz), can be identified with YT accretion (~1.75 Ga). Both of these sutures are cleanly cut by the MCR. The break in the anomalies is narrow (comparable to the surface expression of the MCR) indicating that rifting impacts on the entire crustal section were highly localized. The south-dipping NF conductive anomaly extends from surface outcrop to at least the Moho. The SLtz anomaly is north-dipping, extending from mid-crust through the Moho. In both cases there is some evidence for a modestly conductive layer (likely carbon) thrust to mid-lithospheric depths within the overriding terrane.",

The method is applied to a flux transfer event (FTE), which was encountered on 27 June 2007 by at least three (TH-C, TH-D, and TH-E) of the five THEMIS probes and was situated between two oppositely directed reconnection jets near the subsolar magnetopause under a southward interplanetary magnetic field condition. The recovered 3-D field indicates that a magnetic flux rope with a diameter of ~3000 km was embedded in the magnetopause. The FTE flux rope had a significantly 3-D structure, because the 3-D field reconstructed from the data from TH-C and TH-D (separated by ~390 km) better predicts magnetic field variations actually measured along the TH-E path than does the 2-D Grad-Shafranov reconstruction using the data from TH-C (which was closer to TH-E than TH-D and was at ~1000 km from TH-E). Such a 3-D nature suggests that reconnected field lines from the two reconnection sites are entangled in a complicated way through their interaction with each other. The generation process of the observed 3-D flux rope is discussed on the basis of the reconstruction results and the pitch-angle distribution of electrons observed in and around the FTE.\n",

            "abstract": "Geosciences are becoming increasingly data intensive, particularly in relation to sustainability problems, which are multi-dimensional, weakly structured and characterized by high levels of uncertainty. In the case of complex resource management problems, the challenge is to extract meaningful information from data and make sense of it. Simultaneously, scientific knowledge alone is insufficient to change practice. Creating tools, and group decision support processes for end users to interact with data are key challenges to transforming science-based information into actionable knowledge.\nThe ENCOMPASS project began as a multi-year case study in the Atacama Desert of Chile to design and implement a knowledge transfer model for energy-water-mining conflicts in the region. ENCOMPASS combines the use of cyberinfrastructure (CI), automated data collection, interactive interfaces for dynamic decision support, and participatory modelling to support social learning.\nA pilot version of the ENCOMPASS CI uses open source systems and serves as a structure to integrate and store multiple forms of data and knowledge, such as DEM, meteorological, water quality, geomicrobiological, energy demand, and groundwater models. In the case study, informatics and data fusion needs related to scientific uncertainty around deep groundwater flowpaths and energy-water connections. Users may upload data from field sites with handheld devices or desktops. Once uploaded, data assets are accessible for a variety of uses.\nTo address multi-attributed decision problems in the Atacama region a standalone application with touch-enabled interfaces was created to improve real-time interactions with datasets by groups. The tool was used to merge datasets from the ENCOMPASS CI to support exploration among alternatives and build shared understanding among stakeholders.\nTo date, the project has increased technical capacity among stakeholders, resulted in the creation of both for-profit and non-profit entities, enabled cross-sector collaboration with mining-indigenous stakeholders, and produced an interactive application for group decision support. ENCOMPASS leverages advances in computational tools to deliver data and models for group decision support applied to sustainability science problems.",

            "abstract": "Required by Congress under the Global Change Act of 1990 to inform the nation on the findings of current climate research, the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), released in May 2014, is a rich resource for climate change education, communications and outreach (ECO). Using a website design with mobile applications in mind, NCA takes advantage of mobile learning technology which is revolutionizing how, when and where learning occurs. In an effort to maximize the \"teachable moments\" inherent in the assessment, a community of experts from the National Center for Science Education and the CLEAN Network, working under the auspices of the National Climate Assessment Network (NCAnet) Education Affinity Group, have developed a series of NCA Learning Pathways that match key NCA messages and resources with reviewed educational materials and trusted online information sources, thereby adding pedagogical depth to the assessment. The NCA Learning Pathways, which focus on the regional chapters of the report, are designed make climate change science more local, human, relevant and, if properly framed by educators and communicators, hopeful for learners. This paper touches on the challenges and opportunities of infusing climate education, communications and outreach into curriculum and society, and details the development and content of NCA Learning Pathways, which are available online through NOAA's Climate.gov website: http://www.climate.gov/teaching",

            "abstract": "Antarctic sea ice distribution, a canary in the coal mine for climate change in the Southern Hemisphere, is controlled by the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The MIZ is the dynamic outer part of the sea-ice zone, where it interacts with the high-energy open ocean and is strongly affected by waves and storms. As an interface between ocean and atmosphere with extreme vertical and horizontal temperature gradients and large variations in mechanical properties, the MIZ is a complex system that evolves with, and impacts upon, the advancing/receding ice edge. More than a zone, it is a migratory transition in 'phase space' that biannually passes across the entire Antarctic SIZ. During the advance phase of sea-ice seasonality, and under freezing conditions, wave-induced pancake-ice formation can lead to rapid ice-edge advance. During the retreat phase, the dynamic break-up and modification of sea ice by passing storms, winds and waves greatly modifies the floe-size distribution within the MIZ, to create smaller floes that melt more rapidly and accelerate sea-ice retreat as spring progresses.\nInspired by the current Arctic MIZ efforts, new fieldwork is proposed to resolve the key characteristics of the Antarctic MIZ and the processes controlling its extent. Combining new autonomous observation technology with ship-based techniques, integrated experiments are being designed to advance our understanding of the MIZ and its role in driving seasonal sea ice advance and retreat around Antarctica. The proposed project provides a unique opportunity to develop an observational, analytical, and science-policy framework for coordinated monitoring of sea ice in both the northern and southern hemispheres, with implications for forecasting, monitoring, and prediction that are essential with increasingly dynamic and variable polar climate systems.",

            "abstract": "The possible detection of a water vapour plume on Europa [1] suggests resemblances to Enceladus, a cryovolcanically active satellite [2]. How does this activity work, and what lesson does Enceladus have for plumes on Europa?\nThe inferred vapour column densities of the Europa [1] and Enceladus [3] plumes are similar, but the inferred velocity and mass flux of the former are higher.\nAt Enceladus, the inferred plume strength is modulated by its orbital position [4,5], suggesting that tides opening and closing cracks control the eruption behaviour [6,7]. An additional source of stress potentially driving eruptions is the effect of slow freezing of the ice shell above\n[7,8]. The original detection of the Europa plume was close to apocentre, when polar fractures are expected to be in tension [1]. Follow-up observations at the same orbital phase did not detect a plume [9], although the Galileo E12 magnetometer data may provide evidence for an earlier plume [Khurana, pers. comm.]. One possible explanation for the plume's disappearance is that longer-period tidal effects are playing a role; there are hints of similar secular changes in the Enceladus data [4,5]. Another is that detectability of the Europa plume\nin the aurora observations also depends on variations in electron density (which affects the UV emission flux) [9]. Or it may simply be that eruptive activity on Europa is highly time-variable, as on Io.\nAt Enceladus, the plume scale height is independent of orbital position and plume brightness [5]. This suggests that the vapour velocity does not depend on crack width, consistent with supersonic flow through a near-surface throat. The large scale height inferred for the Europa plume likewise suggests supersonic behaviour. Continuous fallback of solid plume material at Enceladus affects both the colour [10] and surface texture [2] of near-polar regions. Less frequent plume activity would produce subtler effects; whether the sparse available imagery at Europa [11] contains any similar evidence is yet to be determined. Forthcoming Hubble observations may also provide additional constraints.\n[1] Roth et al. 2012 [2] Porco et al. 2006 [3] Hansen et al. 2011 [4] Hedman et al. 2013 [5] Nimmo et al. 2014 [6] Hurford et al. 2007 [7] Porco et al. 2014 [8] Manga and Wang 2007 [9] Roth et al., submitted [10] Schenk et al. 2011.

            "abstract": "Two issues are often recognized as main risk drivers for carbon storage projects. The first is the possibility of pressure-induced slip of pre-existing faults, which can lead to breaching of seals to CO2 storage reservoirs. Although the mechanics of induced seismicity are well known, the characteristics of such slip events are poorly constrained and significant questions remain. The second is the potential impact of leaking CO2 on the quality of shallow potable groundwater. While several studies have been conducted using laboratory tests, natural analogues, and numerical models to evaluate the water quality changes induced by elevated CO2 concentrations, predictive understanding of these coupled processes remains limited in realistic field settings.\nWe discuss in this invited contribution two controlled-release field experiments targeting remaining science gaps associated with induced seismicity and groundwater chemistry. The first experiment is a planned active fault slip experiment conducted in an underground research laboratory (URL) in a hardened shale formation that serves as a caprock analog. The critically stressed fault will be perturbed by the injection of fluid under pressure to simulate the influence of CO2 overpressure. The in situ reactivation experiment will use a novel borehole deformation tool that assesses the magnitude of overpressure required to cause slip, defines the mode of this slip as creeping (aseismic) or rapid (seismic), and measures the evolution of permeability on the fault.\nThe second controlled-release field experiment was conducted in 2011/2012 to simulate the release of CO2 from a geologic storage site and study the transport as well as the chemical mechanisms leading to the CO2-induced mobilization of trace elements in a shallow aquifer. The field test involved a dipole system in which the shallow groundwater was pumped from one well, saturated with CO2 at the pressure corresponding to the hydraulic pressure of the aquifer, and then re-injected into the same aquifer using a second well. Innovative monitoring techniques were used to measure water quality changes and to detect the dissolved CO2 plume. For both field studies, we will discuss related coupled-processes modeling work.",

            "abstract": "Asian dust particles in Japan and China were identified by their size, shape and composition through the use of electron microscopes. Knowledge of salt formation, sea salt mixing and bacterial transportation associated with the particles, and the subsequence of these processes and phenomena were investigated and discussed.\n(1) Sulfate and nitrate were efficiently produced on dust particles in marine air but the production of the salts in the upwind continental air was very weak. Some studies reported substantial sulfate and nitrate in mineral particles in the urban air of Chinese cities. However, the reported mineral particles were more likely from anthropogenic activities rather than desert dust. The formation of sulfate on Ca-rich particles did not enhance the hygroscopicity of the particles. In contrast, nitrate produced on dust particles changed the particles from hydrophobic to hydrophilic to deliquesce at ~30% RH or less. (2) Evidence for HCl deposition on dust particles in marine air was obtained. In the absence of substantial sulfate and nitrate, chloride formation on dust particles could be a major process capable of converting the particles into aqueous droplets. (3) Dust particles frequently became mixture of mineral dust and sea salt in marine air, causing the change of particles in size, hygroscopicity and other properties. Estimates showed significant enhancement of dust particle gravitational settling by sea salt adherence, resulting in more efficient gravitational removal of the dust particles than without sea salt adherence. Thus the settling of dust particles to sea surface is fundamentally different from that in continental atmosphere. (4) A close relation between bacteria and long-range transported Asian dust was confirmed in dust plumes and their concentrations were proportional and comparable.",

An advanced processing workflow has been laid out using Geocluster CGG software, which includes noise attenuation, 2D SRME multiple attenuation, surface consistent deconvolution, Kirchhoff pre-stack time migration. This processing produces satisfactory seismic images of the whole sedimentary cover, and of southward dipping reflectors in the acoustic basement along the central part of the margin offshore Great Kabylia, that are interpreted as inversion-related blind thrusts as part of flat-ramp systems.\nWe applied this successful processing workflow to old 2D marine MCS data acquired on the North-Ligurian Margin (Malis survey, 1995, R/V Le Nadir), using a 2.5 km, 96 channel streamer and a 1140 cu. in. air-gun array. Particular attention was paid to multiple attenuation in adapting our workflow. The resulting reprocessed seismic images, interpreted with a coincident velocity model obtained by wide-angle data tomography, provide (1) enhanced imaging of the sedimentary cover down to the top of the acoustic basement, including the base of the Messinian evaporites and the sub-salt Miocene series, which appear to be tectonized as far as in the mid-basin, and (2) new evidence of deep crustal structures in the margin which the initial processing had failed to reveal.",

However, recent studies at Stromboli are starting to elucidate some of the complexities in these explosions, with high speed imaging identifying multiple ejection pulses within single explosions. Furthermore, petrological data suggests the presence of a highly crystalline magma in the upper portion of the conduit, which could act as a plug, and indicates a potential source for complexities not seen in existing first order (single viscosity fluid) models. Here we present a detailed laboratory investigation to represent a more complex fluid dynamic scenario in which a viscous liquid (plug) overlays a less viscous fluid within the conduit.\nScaled experiments were designed to reproduce the effects of a plug at the top of the conduit on the dynamics of slug expansion, burst and the resulting geophysical signals. Single slugs ascended silicon oil capped with castor oil in a vertical tube; pressure was measured in the liquid and within the gas 'atmosphere’ above the liquid, and correlated with high-speed imagery of the experiments. Experiments were carried out with different slug gas volumes, thicknesses of the plug and experimental ambient pressure. The results were compared with CFD simulations, carried out both at laboratory and volcanic scale, to further explore the complex pressure distributions and forces exerted on the conduit.\nOur results highlight complex fluid dynamic processes, related to the intrusion of slugs in the viscous plug leading to different flow configurations and liquid mixing. Furthermore, the presence of a viscous plug strongly controls variations in the magnitude of the associated pressure transients, and the slug-plug interaction post burst favours a more impulsive pressure release.",

(ii) Runoff volatility (Yangtze) shows data collapse which, linked to an intra-annual 1/f–spectrum, is represented by a single function not unlike physical systems at criticality and the short and long return times of extremes are Weibull-distributed. Atmospheric and soil moisture variabilities are also discussed. (iii) Soil moisture (in a bucket), whose variability is interpreted by a biased coinflip Ansatz for rainfall events, adds an equation of state to energy and water flux balances comprising Budyko’s frame work for quasi-stationary watershed analysis. Eco-hydrologic state space presentations in terms of surface flux ratios of energy excess (loss by sensible heat over supply by net radiation) versus water excess (loss by discharge over gain by precipitation) allow attributions of state change to external (or climate) and internal (or anthropogenic) causes. Including the vegetation-greenness index (NDVI) as an active tracer extends the eco-hydrologic state space analysis to supplement the common geographical presentations. Two examples demonstrate the approach combining ERA and MODIS data sets: (a) global geobotanic classification by combining first and second moments of the dryness ratio (net radiation over precipitation) and (b) regional attributions (Tibetan Plateau) of vegetation changes.",

The LSW is predominantly agricultural but is experiencing rapid population growth due to its proximity to the greater Toronto area. This has led to extensive land use changes which have impacted its water resources and altered runoff patterns in some rivers draining to the lake. Here, we use a paired-catchment approach, hydrological change detection modelling and remote sensing analysis of satellite images to evaluate the impacts of land use change on the hydrology of the LSW (1994 to 2008). Results show that urbanization increased up to 16% in Lovers Creek, the most-urban impacted catchment. Annual runoff from Lovers Creek increased from 239 to 442 mm/yr in contrast to the reference catchment (Black River at Washago) where runoff was relatively stable with an annual mean of 474 mm/yr. Increased annual runoff from Lovers Creek was not accompanied by an increase in annual precipitation. Discriminant function analysis suggests that early (1992-1997; pre-major development) and late (2004-2009; fully urbanized) periods for Lovers Creek separated mainly based on model parameter sets related to runoff flashiness and evapotranspiration. As a result, parameterization in either period cannot be used interchangeably to produce credible runoff simulations in Lovers Creek due to greater scatter between the parameters in canonical space. Separation of early and late period parameter sets for the reference catchment was based on climate and snowmelt related processes. This suggests that regional climatic variability could be influencing hydrologic change in the reference catchment whereas urbanization amplified the regional natural hydrologic changes in urbanizing catchments of the LSW.",

            "abstract": "Tektites are small stones formed from rapidly cooling drops of molten rock ejected from high velocity asteroid impacts with the Earth, that freeze into a myriad of shapes during flight. Many splash-form tektites have an elongated or dumb-bell shape owing to their rotation prior to solidification[1]. Here we present a novel method for creating ‘artificial tektites’ from spinning drops of molten wax, using diamagnetic levitation to suspend the drops[2]. We find that the solid wax models produced this way are the stable equilibrium shapes of a spinning liquid droplet held together by surface tension.\nIn addition to the geophysical interest in tektite formation, the stable equilibrium shapes of liquid drops have implications for many physical phenomena, covering a wide range of length scales, from nuclear physics (e.g. in studies of rapidly rotating atomic nuclei), to astrophysics (e.g. in studies of the shapes of astronomical bodies such as asteroids, rapidly rotating stars and event horizons of rotating black holes). For liquid drops bound by surface tension, analytical and numerical methods predict a series of stable equilibrium shapes with increasing angular momentum. Slowly spinning drops have an oblate-like shape. With increasing angular momentum these shapes become secularly unstable to a series of triaxial pseudo-ellipsoids that then evolve into a family of two-lobed ‘dumb-bell’ shapes as the angular momentum is increased still further. Our experimental method allows accurate measurements of the drops to be taken, which are useful to validate numerical models.\nThis method has provided a means for observing tektite formation, and has additionally confirmed experimentally the stable equilibrium shapes of liquid drops, distinct from the equivalent shapes of rotating astronomical bodies. Potentially, this technique could be applied to observe the non-equilibrium dynamic processes that are also important in real tektite formation, involving, e.g. viscoelastic effects, non-uniform solidification, surface wrinkling (Schlieren), and rapid separation/fission of dumb-bells via the Rayleigh-Plateau instability.\n[1] M.

The now almost ten year old NAS study that produced the watershed report Rising Above the Gathering Storm warned that the US research establishment encompassing industry, government, academia and nongovernment organizations has lost its way in promoting fundamental high-risk research of the kind that has historically led to the transformational scientific breakthroughs that radically changed and improved our quality of life for more than a century. Low-risk, incremental research dominates industry and most government funding agendas, including NSF (and including NSF's \"transformational research\" agenda!). Unprecedented challenges such as understanding and dealing with the consequences of climate change will require fundamental new ideas and technologies that do not exist. Adapting future ecosystems and human systems to climate variability and change needs new social models of cooperation, new biotechnologies and new environmental mangement strategies that do not now exist. A case can be made that history provides no strong templates for such a future. I argue that research universities, working in close partnerships with government, provides a fertile seedbed for the kinds of scientific knowledge and thinking that could produce \"game changing\" strategies for dealing with climate change. Government has the resources and the ability to convert and scale new ideas into usable knowledge, research universities have the ingenuity and disciplinary spectra to think up new ideas and test them for proof of concept. Co-locating a government presence within a research university has the potential to integrate a research enterprise that is not afraid to fail a few times before potentially hitting paydirt with an institution that can accelerate the translation of fundamental scientific breakthroughs into new usable information. Examples of how this has worked in other scientific settings will be presented to show the potential of this type of collaboration for dealing with climate change.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic or climate signals that originate in net-erosional catchments are transmitted down-system as sediment. The accumulation of that sediment in net-depositional regions and preservation as stratigraphy can be accessed and used to reconstruct signal generation and propagation. Studies of modern to <20 ka sedimentary systems suggest that signal propagation (or lack thereof) is, in part, controlled by the size, relief, and other morphologic characteristics of sediment-production segments. Thus, it’s critical to measure, estimate, or infer aspects of the feeder catchment when reconstructing system behavior from sedimentary deposits.\nHere, we present results from two studies aimed at determining paleo-sediment flux from stratigraphic archives. The first study uses outcropping middle Pleistocene (~0.6 Ma) alluvial-fan deposits in the Panamint Mountains, California, to investigate the relationship of sediment supply to stratigraphic architecture in a small catchment-fan system. The youth of this system allows us to estimate fan volumes from facies architecture and depositional system dimensions based on catchment-area to fan-area relationships of nearby modern systems. These data, combined with preliminary cosmogenic radionuclide-derived paleo-denudation rates, provide an opportunity to examine the nature of erosional signal propagation.\nThe second study examines much older, Upper Mississippian (~325 Ma), fluvial and deltaic strata. Absolute chronologic tools to calculate centennial-millennial rates in deep-time sedimentary archives do not yet exist. Here, we use the extraordinary tidal rhythmite deposits of the Pride Shale in the Appalachian Basin as a high-resolution chronometer to constrain the duration of basin filling. We then use the scale of fluvial channel bodies in the underlying and overlying units combined with climate-specific empirical relationships derived from modern systems to estimate the size of the paleo-catchment. The resultant estimates of sediment yield allow calculation of denudation rates for a system in which the catchment has long-since eroded.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing concern about the indoor air environment, where we spend most of our time. Common methods of improving indoor air quality include controlling pollution sources, increasing ventilation rates or using air purifiers. Photocatalytic remediation technology was suggested as a new possibility to eliminate indoor air pollutants instead of just diluting or disposing them.\nIn the present study, heterogeneous reactions of NO2 were studied on photocatalytic paints containing different size and quantity of TiO2. The heterogeneous reactions were conducted in a photo reactor under simulated atmospheric conditions. The flat pyrex rectangular plates covered with the paint were inserted into the reactor. These plates have been sprayed with the photocatalytic paints at our industrial partner’s (ALLIOS) facilities using a high precision procedure that allowed the application of a thin layer of a given thickness of the paint. This allows a homogeneous coverage of the surface with the paint and an accurate determination of the exact amount of paint exposed to gaseous NO2.\nWe demonstrate that the indoor photocatalytic paints which contain TiO2 can substantially reduce the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). We show that the efficiency of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) removal increase with the quantity of TiO2 in the range 0 - 7 %. The geometric uptake coefficients increase from 5 · 10-6 to 1.6 · 10-5 under light irradiation of the paints. On the other hand, during the reactions of NO2 with this paint (7 % of TiO2) nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO) are formed. Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important harmful indoor pollutant and its photolysis leads to the formation of highly reactive OH radicals (Gomez Alvarez et al., 2013). Maximum conversion efficiencies of NO2to HONO and NO of 15 % and 33 % were observed at 30 % RH, respectively.\nThus, the quantity of TiO2 embedded in the paint is an important parameter regarding the nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) remediation, but may also influence formation of harmful by-products such as HONO, which should be considered for future optimization of photocatalytic paints aimed for indoor applications.\n",

Geodetic estimates of mass changes revealed a possible slight mass gain since the year ~2000. However, longer-term information about length and area changes is scarce and almost no mass budget analysis are available before 2000. We have thus extended both the regional coverage and duration of the time series. As a first step, a glacier inventory for the entire mountain range for the year ~2000 was generated using semi-automated glacier mapping techniques applied to Landsat data. Declassified Hexagon KH-9 data from the 1970s, the SRTM3-DEM and recent stereo data from ~2010 such as Pléiades, SPOT-5, ALOS PRISM, Cartosat and ASTER data allowed geodetic mass balance investigations of selected regions like Muztag Ata (East Pamir), Central Trans Alai Range (North Pamir) and Shimshal Valley (Central Karakoram). The investigations were extended for length and area changes using additional satellite data such as Corona KH-4 and Landsat MSS from the 1970s and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI covering the period since ~2000.\nOur analysis revealed that in the Karakoram 191 out of 251 investigated glaciers were stationary, 33 receding and 27 advancing since the end of the 1970s until ~2000. Overall, we identified a small, but insignificant area decrease for this period. Glaciers in Eastern Pamir behaved similarly: at Muztag Ata they slightly shrank on average since the mid-1970s. In contrast, we found a continuous and significant glacier retreat in the Northern Pamir over the same period. Similar to the Karakoram, glaciers in the Pamir showed a high temporal and spatial variability of their changes with frequent surge activities. Preliminary results on glacier mass budgets revealed slightly negative values from ~1975 until ~2000 and slightly positive values thereafter in all investigated regions.",

We analyzed the forecast skill of drought indices such as the 6-month standardized precipitation index (SPI6), monthly mean soil moisture percentiles (SMP) and the 3-month standardized runoff index (SRI3). The soil moisture and runoff were obtained by drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity land model with forcing derived from the NMME members (NMME_VIC). Drought indices from each member were computed and they were put into percentiles determined from all members in the training period at a given lead. We then formed an ensemble grand mean by averaging all indices together and determined the concurrence measure which is the extent to which all different members agree.\nWe find that : 1) The grand mean has higher skill than individual member; 2) During winter, forecasts are skillful in the regimes where the initial conditions dominant contributions to skill, the agreement between the grand mean and members are above 70-80% . At high leads, the concurrence measure drops to 50-60%, even when forecasts are unskillful. 3) During summer, forecast skill is low and concurrence measure drops to 10-30%, 4). The skill of drought forecasts is regionally and seasonally dependent. The NMME_VIC forecasts tend to over forecast drought events with large false alarm rate. After lead-1, the low thread score indicates no skill. The forecast errors will be analyzed to determine the origin of forecast skill.",

Field data and results from substrate addition microcosm experiments will be presented from two contrasting continental sites of serpentinization: the Tablelands, NL, CAN and The Cedars, CA, USA both Phanerozoic in age. These continental sites share geochemical characteristics that make these environments challenging for life, such as high pH, low Eh, scarce electron acceptors, and limited dissolved inorganic carbon for autotrophic growth. However, microbiological analyses have demonstrated that life does indeed exist in these environments. While environmental genomic studies indicated the potential metabolic capabilities of microorganisms in the sites, actual microbial metabolic activities in these environments remain unknown. To expand the understanding of biogeochemistry of the sites, we are conducting studies focusing on chemical and isotopic measurements, carbon substrate utilization, energy sources, and metabolic pathways of the microorganisms. Thus far, in situ geochemical data suggests that the methane from the Tablelands is primarily non-microbial, while the methane from The Cedars likely has some microbial contributions. To date, substrate addition microcosm experiments show no microbial production of methane from Tablelands’ water and sediments. However, microbial carbon monoxide utilization has been observed in Tableland microcosms, but not in The Cedars microcosms. These results demonstrate how geochemistry and substrate addition experiments can be complementary for the determination of the processes favored at these continental sites of serpentinization.",

Those models estimate discharge with large uncertainties, due to the complex interaction between climate and hydrology, the limited availability and quality of data, as well as model uncertainties. A new purely data-driven scale-extrapolation method to estimate discharge for a large region solely from selected small sub-basins, which are typically 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than the large region, has been developed. When tested in the Baltic Sea drainage basin, the method was able to provide accurate discharge estimation for the gauged area with sub-basins that cover 5% of the gauged area. There exist multiple sets of sub-basins whose climate and hydrology resemble those of the gauged area equally well. Those multiple sets estimate annual discharge for the gauged area consistently well with 6 % average error. The scale-extrapolation method is completely data-driven; therefore it does not force any modelling error into the prediction. The scale-extrapolation method is now further tested at continent scale in Europe and North America to exam its potential for climate change studies.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is central to the ecology and chemistry of inland waters as an energy and nutrient source, transporter of heavy metals and other pollutants, and a control on light attenuation. In this research, we examine the manner in which hydrologic variation interacts with biogeochemical processes to affect the utilization and concentrations of DOM throughout streams and rivers of a large drainage basin. The Pulse-Shunt Concept (PSC) forms the framework for our analysis. The PSC is based, in part, on field observations of pulsed inputs of terrestrial DOM to streams of headwater catchments during high-discharge events that are associated with rainfall and snowmelt. The pulse is followed by the shunt, which occurs as rising flows rapidly transmit terrestrially derived DOM from headwater streams to larger streams and rivers of the drainage network. Owing to the reduction in channel residence times, the shunt perturbs the downstream gradient in DOM lability and compositional diversity established under base-flow conditions, leading to the riverine export of biochemically reactive DOM that has retained its terrestrial signature. We explore the fate of terrestrial DOM subsidies in context of the PSC by developing a simple model that routes water and DOM through an idealized 200,000 km2 basin. This basin is drained by a dendritic channel network comprised of 30,000 first- through seventh-order streams that ultimately feed a 500-km long, eighth-order river. Published scaling laws are used to specify the numbers, lengths, and connectivities of the stream segments, while the routing algorithm describes the precipitation-induced delivery of terrestrial DOM to headwater reaches and the down-network changes in DOM concentrations resulting from rate-limited decomposition and mixing of waters from different reaches. Results of model simulations conducted to date underscore the dominant contribution of low-frequency precipitation events to the annual subsidy of terrestrial DOM to the drainage network.

            "abstract": "Statistical models consistently out-perform conceptual models in the short term, however to account for a nonstationary future (or an unobserved past) scientists prefer to base predictions on unchanging and commutable properties of the universe – i.e., physics.\nThe problem with physically-based hydrology models is, of course, that they aren’t really based on physics – they are based on statistical approximations of physical interactions, and we almost uniformly lack an understanding of the entropy associated with these approximations. Thermodynamics is successful precisely because entropy statistics are computable for homogeneous (well-mixed) systems, and ergodic arguments explain the success of Newton’s laws to describe systems that are fundamentally quantum in nature. Unfortunately, similar arguments do not hold for systems like watersheds that are heterogeneous at a wide range of scales.\nRay Solomonoff formalized the situation in 1968 by showing that given infinite evidence, simultaneously minimizing model complexity and entropy in predictions always leads to the best possible model. The open question in hydrology is about what happens when we don’t have infinite evidence – for example, when the future will not look like the past, or when one watershed does not behave like another. How do we isolate stationary and commutable components of watershed behavior?\nI propose that one possible answer to this dilemma lies in a formal combination of physics and statistics. In this talk I outline my recent analogue (Solomonoff’s theorem was digital) of Solomonoff’s idea that allows us to quantify the complexity/entropy tradeoff in a way that is intuitive to physical scientists. I show how to formally combine “physical” and statistical methods for model development in a way that allows us to derive the theoretically best possible model given any given physics approximation(s) and available observations. Finally, I apply an analogue of Solomonoff’s theorem to evaluate the tradeoff between model complexity and prediction power.",

(GRL, 2011), GPS is used to locate the sensor at the time of transmission.\nWe have studied the performance of Mermaids under different noise conditions in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and most recently near the Galapagos islands and will show a selection of observations.\nIn the Mediterranean, we regularly detect P waves at teleseismic distances of earthquakes with magnitude 6, occasionally below that. Local and regional earthquakes of much lower magnitude, such as a M 4.9 earthquake near Barcelonette (figure), yield seismograms with a high signal to noise ratio.\nIn the much noisier environment of the Indian Ocean the threshold for useful seismograms is close to magnitude 6.5. Yet we were also able to record 235 low magnitude events when a Mermaid was close to a swarm near the Indian Ocean triple junction, with the lowest magnitude estimated to be 2.1; this sequence also enabled us to put an upper limit of about 250 m to the error in sensor location at the time of recording.\nPreliminary data from the Galapagos indicate low noise conditions similar to those in the Mediterranean, with good recordings of events in the magnitude 5 range.\nA new prototype of a spherical \"MultiMermaid\" is currently being tested. It allows for multidisciplinary observations (seismic and kHz acoustics, magnetic field, temperature, bathymetry) and will function about five years with lithium batteries. A global deployment of such instruments in a five-year program is affordable: project MariScope aims for at least 300 floating seismometers in the world's oceans. At the time of writing of this abstract, a proposal is being prepared that involves geophysicists and biologists from France, Germany, Italy and Greece and should result in a first installment of MariScope.

Operation IceBridge utilizes a highly specialized fleet of research aircraft and the most sophisticated suite of innovative science instruments ever assembled to characterize annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets. In addition, Operation IceBridge collects critical data used to predict the response of Earth’s polar ice to climate change and resulting sea-level rise. IceBridge also helps bridge the gap in polar observations between NASA's ICESat satellite missions. Combined with previous aircraft observations, as well as ICESat, CryoSat-2 and the forthcoming ICESat-2 observations, Operation IceBridge will produce a cross-calibrated 17-year time series of ice sheet and sea-ice elevation data over Antarctica, as well as a 27-year time series over Greenland. These time series will be a critical resource for predictive models of sea ice and ice sheet behavior. In addition to laser altimetry, Operation IceBridge is using a comprehensive suite of instruments to produce a three-dimensional view of the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, ice shelves and the sea ice. The suite includes two NASA laser altimeters, the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) and the Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS); four radar systems from the University of Kansas’ Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS), a Ku-band radar altimeter, accumulation radar, snow radar and the Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS); a Sander Geophysics airborne gravimeter (AIRGrav), a magnetometer and a high-resolution stereographic camera (DMS).

            "abstract": "Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has proven useful in asessing the fate of groundwater contamination. However, although evidence of diffuse pesticide degradation is crucial, and CSIA methods have been developed for several pesticides, there is a clear lack of field CSIA data of pesticides. This study now presents the first analysis of field CSIA data from a 47-ha agricultural headwater catchment (Alteckendorf, Alsace, France) in the period March to August 2012. Measured stream concentrations of the two investigated chloroacetanilide herbicides (S-metolachlor and acetochlor) were highest (65 μg/L) following an intense rainfall event in the first month after herbicide application. Carbon isotope ratios increased with more than 2 ‰ in 3 months, which indicates the occurrence of herbicide degradation during transport to the stream. Previously, field CSIA data have also been simulated with reactive transport models to evaluate degradation of groundwater contaminants. This study now presents such a model-assisted interpretation of CSIA data for the first time at catchment scale, which aims at exploring the added value of CSIA in monitoring and modelling of pesticide pollution. The conceptual mathematical model succeeded in reproducing the general trend in concentrations and carbon isotope ratios of metolachlor. It also allowed for the quantification of metolachlor degradation (above 70 % during the study period), and yielded a mass export of 1.8 % of the applied pesticide, which is in agreement with the measured pesticide export. The field concentration and CSIA data informed the model building by indicating the importance of overland flow, and slow pesticide degradation in groundwater compared to the upper soil zone. Moreover, incorporation of the field CSIA data into model calibration slightly reduced model uncertainty in the quantification of pesticide degradation. We suggest that a finer temporal CSIA resolution than possible in this study, especially during base flow conditions, would result in a more significant reduction of model uncertainty. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate how a combined monitoring and modelling approach of concentration and CSIA data can result in an improved understanding of pesticide transport and degradation at catchment scale.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the transition between effusive and explosive activity in dome-forming volcanoes remains a challenging question for eruption forecasting and eruptive scenario definition. The explosive activity of 26 Oct. and 5 Nov. during the 2010 eruption of Merapi volcano offers the opportunity to explore this transition by quantifying the mechanisms that led to the dome explosion.\nForty-three pumice samples were analyzed by 1) scanning electron microscope for textural analysis and 2) elemental analyzer for water content. The SEM images were processed so as to determine the proportions of gas bubbles, microlites and glass in each sample. These data were combined with the glass water content to feed the simple physical model developed by Burgisser et al. [1,2] to calculate pre-explosive pressure, depth, and porosity level for each pyroclastic pumice sample.\nPreliminary results indicate that the water content in the melt is high, reaching 7 wt.%. These water contents yield a wide range of pre-eruptive pressures. Samples from 26 Oct. originated at pressures from a few MPa to 280 MPa. These pressures correspond to depths ranging from a few hundred meters to more than 10 km. This suggests that large overpressures were associated with conduit evacuation that reached unexpected depths. Samples from the 5 Nov. event range from ~10 to ~100 MPa. This suggests that this event also evacuated a large part of the volcanic conduit. Pre-explosive porosities of both events are low (<10 vol. %) along the depth of the entire conduit, which suggests extensive permeable outgassing of the magma-filed conduit prior to each explosive evacuation.\nOngoing work includes analysis of melt CO2 content due to preliminary evidence that it played an important role in the 2010 Merapi eruption. The modeled conduit properties serve as baseline data for conduit flow modeling and building plausible eruptive scenarios.\n[1] Burgisser et al. (2010) J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 194, 27-41.

They were composed by less than 20 sites each, mainly over undisturbed forest and without a strong coordination between sites, in particular across the ocean.\nIn the following years the networks grew exponentially both at continental and global level, reaching more than 500 sites few years ago and expanding the eddy covariance measurement to different ecosystem types, climate regions and management/disturbance regimes. At the same time, important steps were done in terms of cooperation and harmonization related to data processing, data description and data sharing policies, leading to inter-continental and global activities under the FLUXNET framework.\nToday the networks are facing a new evolution step, moving from pure research activities to something that includes also monitoring and research infrastructure characteristics. AmeriFlux and NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) in USA and ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) in Europe are opening a new phase in the eddy covariance networks: with a long term perspective, increased level of standardization and a completely open access policy, will hopefully stimulate even more global synthesis studies and a wider use of the flux measurements by other scientific communities. AmeriFlux, NEON and ICOS are also strongly involved in cross-networks harmonization activities in terms of data acquisition, data processing and data format, in order to simplify and encourage the joint use of their measurements.\nA brief history of the development, challenges and solutions in the organization of the different networks and their common activities will be presented, to focus then on selected scientific results that have been possible only thanks to the global integration and international collaboration and finally discuss future developments and current ongoing activities in terms of data harmonization/standardization and sharing.",

The increases in CO2 and CH4 during the late Holocene are anomalous compared to the decreasing trends in a stacked average of previous interglaciations, thereby supporting an anthropogenic origin. During interglacial stage 19, the closest Holocene insolation analog, CO2 fell to 245 ppm by the time equivalent to the present, in contrast to the observed pre-industrial rise to 280-285 ppm. The 245-ppm level measured in stage 19 falls at the top of the natural range predicted by the original anthropogenic hypothesis of Ruddiman (2003).\n Bottom-up evidence comes from a growing list of archeological and other compilations showing major early anthropogenic transformations of Earth’s surface. Key examples include: efforts by Dorian Fuller and colleagues mapping the spread of irrigated rice agriculture across southern Asia and its effects on CH4 emissions prior to the industrial era; an additional effort by Fuller showing the spread of methane-emitting domesticated livestock across Asia and Africa (coincident with the spread of fertile crescent livestock across Europe); historical compilations by Jed Kaplan and colleagues documenting very high early per-capita forest clearance in Europe, thus underpinning simulations of extensive pre-industrial clearance and large CO2 emissions; and wide-ranging studies by Erle Ellis and colleagues of early anthropogenic land transformations in China and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Globally, drought events are increasing in both frequency and intensity. Spatial and temporal variation in water availability is expected to alter the ecophysiology and structure of forests, with consequent feedbacks to climate change. Extensive tree mortality induced by heat and aridity has been documented across a range of latitudes, and several global vegetation models have simulated widespread forest die-off in the future. The impact of drought on forest structure and function will depend on the differential responses of trees of different sizes. Understanding the size-dependence of drought-induced mortality is necessary to predict local and global impacts. Here we show that in forests worldwide, drought has a greater impact on the growth and mortality of large trees compared to smaller trees. This trend holds true for forests ranging from semiarid woodlands to tropical rainforests. This finding contrasts with what would be expected if deep root access to water were the primary determinant of tree drought response. Rather, the greater drought response of larger trees could be driven by greater inherent vulnerability of large trees to hydraulic stress or by canopy position becoming more of a liability under drought, as exposed crowns face higher evaporative demand. These findings imply that future droughts will have a disproportionate effect on large trees, resulting in a larger feedback to climate change than would occur if all tree size classes were equally affected by drought.",

After a small number of preliminary orbits during which the orbital period is reduced, approximately 30 science orbits will be executed to explore the interior of Jupiter, hence, its origin. A second primary objective of the mission, and the subject of this talk, is to carry out the first exploration of Jupiter’s polar magnetosphere. All previous missions to Jupiter, including Ulysses, remained at low Jovian latitudes at close range, hence, our knowledge of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere is a composite of remote sensing (such as radio emissions in the hectometric and decametric bands as well as IR and UV images); application of observations of Earth's auroral and polar cap particles, fields, and auroral emissions; and modeling. While these likely inform our expectations of what Juno will actually measure qualitatively, Juno will provide the first in depth exploration of auroral processes at another planet, other than a small number of very brief encounters of Saturn's kilometric radio source region by Cassini. With a reasonably complete suite of in situ magnetospheric measurements coupled with remote sensing, Juno will enable us to compare Jupiter’s polar magnetosphere with those expectations. Certainly, understanding the nature of auroral currents and mechanisms for particle acceleration are high on the list of priorities for these studies. In addition, it is expected that Juno will greatly improve our understanding of the mapping of auroral processes from high latitudes and low altitudes to the middle and outer magnetosphere.",

The U.S. locations are each supported by VHF Lightning Mapping Arrays.\nTotal lightning density is shown to increase by a factor of 2-3 as a function of CCN concentration over tropical land and ocean regions. The greatest sensitivity in the lightning vs. aerosol relationship was found in more unstable environments and where warm-cloud depth was intermediate (deep) over land (ocean). The maximum height of 30 dBZ echo tops in lightning producing convective features was found to be insensitive to changes in CCN concentration. However, the vertical profile of radar reflectivity (VPRR) showed a consistent increase of 2-4 dBZ for convective features that developed in more polluted environments, suggesting that aerosols may act to intensify the convection, but not necessarily make the convection deeper. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aerosols act to invigorate convection by influencing the evolution of a cloud's hydrometeor populations.\nFor the regional scale analysis, storms in Colorado have favorable thermodynamics (high cloud bases, shallow warm cloud depths and large CAPE’s) that aerosols (CCN) appear to have little effect in a bulk sense. For the three remaining regions, storms forming in environments with CCN concentrations between 700 and 1200 cm-3 have notably stronger VPRR and larger flash rates. For aerosol concentrations below and above this range, storms have less vigor and reduced flash rates, consistent with the Rosenfeld et al. (2008) study.\nFinally we show how continental aerosols transported by Rossby gyres following propagating MJO’s over the CIO may act to modify convection north of the Equator. This effect is minimal south of the Equator where the gyres transport pristine aerosol concentrations from the southern Indian Ocean towards the Equator.",

            "abstract": "Transparency and reproducibility are fundamental properties of good science. In the current era of large and diverse datasets and long and complex workflows for data analysis and inference, ensuring such transparency and reproducibility is challenging. Hydrological science is a good case in point, because the discipline typically uses a large variety of datasets ranging from local observations to large-scale remotely sensed products. These data are often obtained from various different sources, and integrated using complex yet uncertain modelling tools. In this paper, we present and discuss methods of ensuring transparency and reproducibility in scientific workflows for hydrological data analysis for the purpose of water resources assessment, using relevant examples of emerging open source “big data” tools.\nFirst, we discuss standards for data storage, access, and processing that allow improving the modularity of a hydrological analysis workflow. In particular standards emerging from the Open Geospatial Consortium, such as the Sensor Observation Service, the Web Coverage Service, hold promise. However, some bottlenecks such as the availability of data models and the ability to work with spatio-temperal subsets of large datasets, need further development.\nNext, we focus on available methods to build transparent data processing workflows. Again, standards such as OGC’s Web Processing Service are being developed to facilitate web-based analytics. Yet, in practice, the experimental nature of these standards and web services in general often requires a more pragmatic approach. The availability of web technologies in popular open source data analysis environments such as R and Python often makes them an attractive solution for workflow creation and sharing.\nLastly, we elaborate on the potential of open source solutions hold in the context of participatory approaches to data collection and knowledge generation. Using examples from the tropical Andes and the Himalayas, we show how these technologies can help reducing the traditional knowledge gap, by allowing participation from resources constraint stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "Incorporating the influence of climate change and long-term climate variability in the estimation of drought risk is a priority for water resource planners. Australia’s highly variable rainfall regime is influenced by ocean-atmosphere climate mechanisms which induce decadal-scale variability in hydrological data. This talk will summarize research on the identification of appropriate models for incorporating decadal scale variability into stochastic hydrological models. These will include autoregressive, hidden Markov models and a Bayesian hierarchical approach which combines paleo information on climate indices and hydrological data into a climate informed multi-time scale stochastic (CIMSS) framework. To characterize long-term variability for the first level of the hierarchy, paleoclimate and instrumental data describing the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are analyzed. A new paleo IPO-PDO time series dating back 440 yr is produced, combining seven IPO-PDO paleo sources using an objective smoothing procedure to fit low-pass filters to individual records. The paleo data analysis indicates that wet/dry IPO-PDO states have a broad range of run lengths, with 90% between 3 and 33 yr and a mean of 15 yr. Model selection techniques were used to determine a suitable stochastic model to simulate these run lengths. For the second level of the hierarchy, a seasonal rainfall model is conditioned on the simulated IPO-PDO state. Application to two high quality rainfall sites close to water supply reservoirs found that mean seasonal rainfall in the IPO-PDO dry state was 15%–28% lower than the wet state. Furthermore, analysis of the impact of the CIMSS framework on drought risk analysis found that short-term drought risks conditional on IPO/PDO state were far higher than the traditional AR(1) model.",

            "abstract": "NASA is a significant contributor to the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), which is a central component of the 2012-2022 U.S. Global Change Research Program Strategic Plan. The NCA has identified the need for indicators that provide a clear, concise way of communicating to NCA audiences about not only the status and trends of physical drivers of the climate system, but also the ecological and socioeconomic impacts, vulnerabilities, and responses to those drivers.\nWe are using thermal infrared satellite data in conjunction with in situ measurements to produce water temperatures for all the large inland water bodies in North America for potential use as an indicator for the NCA. Recent studies have revealed significant warming of inland waters throughout the world. The observed rate of warming is – in many cases – greater than that of the ambient air temperature. These rapid, unprecedented changes in inland water temperatures have profound implications for lake hydrodynamics, productivity, and biotic communities. Scientists are just beginning to understand the global extent, regional patterns, physical mechanisms, and ecological consequences of lake warming.\nAs part of our earlier studies we have collected thermal infrared satellite data from those satellite sensors that provide long-term and frequent spaceborne thermal infrared measurements of inland waters including ATSR, AVHRR, and MODIS and used these to examine trends in water surface temperature for approximately 100 of the largest inland water bodies in the world. We are now extending this work to generate temperature time-series of all North American inland water bodies that are sufficiently large to be studied using 1km resolution satellite data for the last 3 decades. These data are then being related to changes in the surface air temperature and compared with regional trends in water surface temperature derived from CMIP5/IPCC model simulations/projections to better predict future temperature changes. This information is also being used to develop ecologically relevant indicators that are meaningful to the general public, and useful for the National Climate Assessment teams.\nWe will discuss the available datasets and processing methodologies together with their potential use for climate assessment.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 eruption of Gunung Merapi (Java, Indonesia) began with an explosion resulting from the rapid development of shallow conduit overpressure, which destabilized the pre-existing lava dome and generated large PDCs on 26 October. This was followed by rapid ascent and extrusion of a juvenile dome that also collapsed, generating the largest surges of the series on 5 November. Lava lapilli within the PDC deposits were analyzed using helium pycnometry to determine variations in pyroclast porosity during the transition from dome collapse to rapid dome regrowth and subsequent collapse. Lapilli were separated into pyroclasts derived from the earlier phase of dome growth from those derived from the later and more voluminous phase of dome growth. For all lapilli, regardless of eruptive phase, open porosity of the pyroclasts averages 0.19 (0.08). However, closed porosities of the lapilli are generally higher for the earlier phase, which were derived from deposits of the 26 October PDCs. Efficient degassing during both stages of dome growth produced similar open porosities in pyroclasts, but a higher closed porosity in the 26 October samples resulted from late-stage vesiculation of the residual melt during the initial explosion. This vesiculation event was triggered by the rapid development of shallow conduit overpressure, evidence of which is provided by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling analyses of plagioclase phenocrysts from the ash-sized component of the PDC deposits. Phenocrysts from the earlier phase of dome growth show a build-up of Li in the groundmass glass (attached to crystal surfaces) due to a stage of protracted gas accumulation prior to the 26 October explosion. Conversely, phenocrysts from the later stage of dome growth reveal decreasing Li contents in the groundmass glass due to efficient volatile loss during magma ascent. Vesiculation of the residual melt during the initial explosion resulted in a higher closed porosity in pyroclasts derived from the 26 October PDCs. Thus, although efficient degassing during ascent may result in similar open porosities of lava lapilli, sudden variations in conduit conditions will alter the textural characteristics of pyroclasts immediately prior to their eruption and deposition, which are not revealed through a measurement of density alone.",

            "abstract": "Canada’s boreal forest supports many aquatic ecosystem services (AES) due to the intimate linkage between aquatic systems and their surrounding terrestrial watersheds in forested landscapes. There is an increasing risk to AES because natural development activities (forest management, mining, energy) have resulted in disruptions that deteriorate aquatic ecosystems at local (10s of km2) to regional (100s of km2) scales. These activities are intensifying and expanding, placing at risk the healthy aquatic ecosystems that provide AES and may threaten the continued development of the energy, forest, and mining sectors. Remarkably, we know little about the consequences of these activities on AES. The idea that AES should be explicitly integrated into modern natural resource management regulations is gaining broad acceptance. A major need is the ability to measure cumulative effects and determine thresholds (the points where aquatic ecosystems and their services cannot recover to a desired state within a reasonable time frame) in these cumulative effects. However, there is no single conceptual approach to assessing cumulative effects that is widely accepted by both scientists and managers. We present an integrated science-policy framework that enables the integration of AES into forest management risk assessment and prevention/mitigation strategies. We use this framework to explore the risk of further deterioration of AES by (1) setting risk criteria; (2) using emerging technologies to map process-based indicators representing causes and consequences of risk events to the deterioration of AES; (3) assessing existing prevention and mitigation policies in place to avoid risk events; and (4) identifying priorities for policy change needed to reduce risk event. Ultimately, the success of this framework requires that higher value be placed on AES, and in turn to improve the science and management of the boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "Postseismic surface deformation is used to investigate both fault behaviour and lithospheric rheology, with the two being closely linked. Studies of postseismic deformation are therefore important in enabling us to characterize the progression of an earthquake cycle, as well as potentially feeding into long timescale geodynamic models. We have studied a number of earthquakes on the seismically active Tibetan Plateau. Collectively, the postseismic phases of these events reveal the processes that occur in the months to decades following major earthquakes. Our aim in this presentation is to highlight what we consider are the important facets of these processes, in order to aid future postseismic studies. In some cases there is a clear signature of afterslip only (e.g. the Nima-Gaize, Yutian and Damxung earthquakes in 2008), with no detectable contribution from viscoelastic relaxation (VER). Such cases enable straightforward characterization of afterslip (e.g. duration, spatial distribution), which can be used to inform other studies. There is also one case of viscoelastic relaxation only (the 1951/1952 Beng Co/Gulu earthquakes), with no “contamination” from afterslip within the late postseismic observation period. In light of this latter case, we re-examine previously-published InSAR datasets for the 1997 Manyi and 2001 Kokoxili earthquakes. Since these were strike-slip events, interpretation of their postseismic signature has in the past caused some uncertainty. We use synthetic examples to demonstrate how to distinguish between afterslip and VER, and apply the insights gained to individual interferograms for these large earthquakes. How earthquake magnitude, focal mechanism and observation time affect postseismic deformation is also explored. Finally, we present an example of postseismic release faulting imaged by InSAR (the Zhongba earthquake, 2008), which appears to take the place of afterslip in the conventional sense. Where relevant, comparisons are made with findings from postseismic studies elsewhere in the world. As a community, we are now at the stage where enormous value can be gained from pooling results and insights from the many postseismic investigations that have been published, which will enable us to model earthquakes, faults and their associated seismic hazard more effectively.",

            "abstract": "Over the coming century, climate change has the potential to impact infrastructure, particularly in population-dense areas that depend on transportation and built environments. Many of these impacts may occur via changes in the frequency and magnitude of extremes: high and low temperature, precipitation, coastal flooding, and storm events. High temperatures, for example, accelerate the deterioration of some types of infrastructure materials; affect aircraft performance; require increased refrigeration and cooling for ports and terminals; and shorten construction times for work crews. Heavy precipitation events affect bridge scour, culvert performance, roadways, and transportation safety, impairing operations and travel or bringing them to a standstill. Stronger hurricanes and increased risk of coastal flooding due to storm surges and sea level rise can lead to temporary and permanent flooding of transportation- and built infrastructure as well as residential areas.\nWe describe the development of, and projected future changes in, a collection of infrastructure-relevant climate indices for three different locations within the United States: the Mobile Bay region in the Southeastern U.S., the city of Cambridge, MA in the Northeastern U.S., and the city of Austin, TX in the Southern Great Plains. The indices are based on mean and extreme temperature, precipitation, humidity, and combinations thereof, and vary depending on the region. Historical trends are calculated from long-term weather stations, while projected future changes are based on GCM simulations corresponding to a lower and a higher scenario, statistically downscaled to the same individual station records using the ARRM model.\nWe find that all three locations are likely to be affected by an increase in average temperatures as well as a greater number of extremely hot days and heat waves with increasing risk under a higher scenario as compared to a lower. For precipitation, projected changes differ based on both the nature of the indices relevant to each region as well as the spatially inhomogeneous rate of change in mean and extreme precipitation. These results highlight the importance of local knowledge and flexibility in identifying thresholds and potential indices relevant to quantifying the impacts of climate change at the regional scale.",

            "abstract": "Pore-scale modeling is recently become an important tool for a deeper understanding of complex transport phenomena in porous media. However its direct usage for field-scale processes is still hindered by limited predictive capabilities. This is due to the large uncertainties in the micro-scale parameters, in the pore geometries, in the limited number of available samples, and in the numerical errors. These issues are often overlooked because it is usually thought that the computational cost of pore-scale simulation prohibits an extensive uncertainty quantification study with large number of samples.\nIn this work we propose an computational tool to estimate statistics of pore-scale quantities. The algorithm is based on (i) an efficient automatic CFD solver for pore-scale simulations, (ii) a multi-scale Bayesian theoretical framework, and (iii) a generalized multilevel Monte Carlo to speed up the statistical computations. Exploiting the variance reduction of the multi-level and multi-scale representation, we demonstrate the feasibility of the forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. The former consists in quantifying the effect of micro-scale heterogeneities and parametric uncertainties on macro-scale upscaled quantities.

            "abstract": "The identification of putative ancient deltaic sedimentary systems on Mars has been both exciting and controversial. Our excitement is elicted by the potential provided by deltas as evidence for standing bodies of water associated with the deltas, and the resulting implications for both the ancient climate of Mars and ancient habitability. The controversy stems from how confident can we be in the identification of ancient deltaic systems from orbital data, and how robust are our assertions about the habitability potential of such settings. Delta systems in particular are key astrobiological targets because at their distal toes fine-grained sediment (ie., clays) settle from suspension in a lower energy setting and they are commonly characterised by high rates of sedimentation. This leads to high preservation potential of biosignatures. Targeting of future Mars rovers to investigate deltaic landing sites requires better understanding of these issues to reduce exploration risk. In this presentation, we describe the key criteria that enable us to make robust interpretations of deltaic stratigraphy and constrain delta evolution for martian systems. In particular, the past 10 years has seen in a revolution in our process understanding of terrestrial delta systems through a combination of field, experimental and numerical modelling studies. Analysis of martian deltas has much to gain from these results. We go on to consider why deltaic systems offer potential as astrobiological target paleoenvironments. We use the exhumed delta system (Hypanis delta system) at the termination of Hypanis Vallis, 11.8°N, 314.96°E as a case example. This system, situated in Xanthe Terra, comprises layered sedimentary rocks with an overall multi-lobate geometry and associated inverted channel networks. The Hypanis 'delta' is a proposed landing site for the ExoMars rover and also for the NASA 2020 mission.",

            "abstract": "Public health studies often require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. This technological limitation prevents the wide usage of remote sensing data in epidemiological studies. To solve this issue, we have developed a few image fusion techniques to generate high temporally-resolved image data. We downscaled GOES LST data to 15-minute 1-km resolution to assess community-based heat-related risk in Los Angeles County, California and simulated ASTER datasets by fusing ASTER and MODIS data to derive biophysical variables, including LST, NDVI, and normalized difference water index, to examine the effects of those environmental characteristics on WNV outbreak and dissemination. A spatio-temporal analysis of WNV outbreak and dissemination was conducted by synthesizing the remote sensing variables and mosquito surveillance data, and by focusing on WNV risk areas in July through September due to data sufficiency of mosquito pools. Moderate- and high-risk areas of WNV infections in mosquitoes were identified for five epidemiological weeks. These identified WNV-risk areas were then collocated in GIS with heat hazard, exposure, and vulnerability maps to answer the question of whether WNV is a heat related virus. The results show that elevation and built-up conditions were negatively associated with the WNV propagation, while LST positively correlated with the viral transmission. NDVI was not significantly associated with WNV transmission. San Fernando Valley was found to be the most vulnerable to mosquito infections of WNV. This research provides important insights into how high temporal resolution remote sensing imagery may be used to study time-dependant events in public health, especially in the operational surveillance and control of vector-borne, water-borne, or other epidemic diseases.",

The problem has been approached first by studying the kinetics of calcite dissolution and then coupling ion-pairing software with flow and mass transport models. Porosity development models require high computational power. A workaround to reduce computational complexity is to assume the calcite dissolution reaction is relatively fast, thus equilibrium chemistry can be used to model it (Sanford & Konikow, 1989). Later developments allowed the full coupling of kinetics and transport in a model. However kinetics effects of calcite dissolution were found negligible under the single set of assumed hydrological and geochemical boundary conditions. A model is implemented with the coupling of FeFlow software as the flow & transport module and PHREEQC4FEFLOW (Wissmeier, 2013) ion-pairing module. The model is used to assess the influence of heterogeneities in hydrological, geochemical and lithological boundary conditions on porosity evolution. The hydrologic conditions present in the karst aquifer of Quintana Roo coast in Mexico are used as a guide for generating inputs for simulations.",

Immerse the continental fragments in seawater until the shelves and interior seaways are thoroughly flooded. Add a pinch of CO2 and heat gently. While the ocean is warming and de-oxygenating, gradually stir in the phosphate that was put aside earlier. Keep stirring and adding CO2 and phosphate until a thick black carbon crust suddenly forms. Remove the crust. Repeat to create as many carbon layers as possible before the cake starts to cool and the ocean re-oxygenates.\nIn this talk I will test this recipe using an Earth system model, discussing the potential role of sedimentary phosphate regeneration feedbacks in triggering carbon burial events, and the role of massive carbon burial in creating the necessary conditions to exit an OAE. I will also illustrate how the dynamics of entering and exiting an OAE depend on boundary conditions such as continental configuration and whether enhanced CO2 out-gassing and weathering (and its attendant higher rate of nutrient supply to the ocean) is a sufficient trigger. Finally, in utilizing an isotope-enabled Earth system model (‘GENIE’ – http://mycgenie.seao2.org) in generating an OAE-like event, the plausibility of the recipe can be tested by analyzing the simulated phasing of climate, d13C, ocean redox, and carbon burial, which I will show contrasted with the geological record.",

            "abstract": "In many scientific disciplines, scientists and data managers are bracing for an upcoming deluge of big data volumes, which will increase the size of current data archives by a factor of 10-100 times. For example, the next Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6) will generate a global archive of model output of approximately 10-20 Peta-bytes, while the upcoming next generation of NASA decadal Earth Observing instruments are expected to collect tens of Giga-bytes/day. In radio-astronomy, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will collect data in the Exa-bytes/day range, of which (after reduction and processing) around 1.5 Exa-bytes/year will be stored. The effective and timely processing of these enormous data streams will require the design of new data reduction and processing algorithms, new system architectures, and new techniques for evaluating computation uncertainty. Yet at present no general software tool or framework exists that will allow system architects to model their expected data processing workflow, and determine the network, computational and storage resources needed to prepare their data for scientific analysis.\nIn order to fill this gap, at NASA/JPL we have been developing a preliminary model named DAWN (Distributed Analytics, Workflows and Numerics) for simulating arbitrary complex workflows composed of any number of data processing and movement tasks. The model can be configured with a representation of the problem at hand (the data volumes, the processing algorithms, the available computing and network resources), and is able to evaluate tradeoffs between different possible workflows based on several estimators: overall elapsed time, separate computation and transfer times, resulting uncertainty, and others. So far, we have been applying DAWN to analyze architectural solutions for 4 different use cases from distinct science disciplines: climate science, astronomy, hydrology and a generic cloud computing use case. This talk will present preliminary results and discuss how DAWN can be evolved into a powerful tool for designing system architectures for data intensive science.",

            "abstract": "The direct effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on tropical forests have been the focus of a large body of research including manipulative experiments, observational studies and model estimation. The work presented here seeks to evaluate the processes involved in modelling forest dynamics under changes in atmospheric CO2, and ascertain the strengths and deficiencies of these representations. To do this, the Ecosystem Demography Model 2 (ED2) and the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5-BGC) are used to simulate the vegetation dynamics of an old-growth Central Amazonian forest through the next century, and are compared with flux and inventory data. Using default calibrations (regional specificity), both models were found to overestimate mortality rate and biomass increment (by 1.4 and 0.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in ED2 and CLM respectively). This comparison has lead to a closer examination of mortality, the allocation of assimilated carbon and the phasing of plant competition. An analysis of model output and literature review corroborate that tree mortality in old growth tropical forests is complex and is driven by a variety of mechanisms. We find that mortality parameterizations used in earth system models may benefit from simplicity until a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of mortality and its drivers becomes available. An analysis of field data also showed that a significant fraction of mature trees in the upper canopy were exhibiting no increment in growth. It is not immediately clear if these trees are exhibiting decreased net primary production, or alternatively, how these trees have shifted their resource usage strategy. Demographic ecosystem models such as ED2 provide a means to represent and test these alternative hypotheses as they emerge.",

Subsequently, this model was extended and applied to 3756 wells in the Fayetteville shale, 2199 wells in the Haynesville shale, and 2764 wells in the Marcellus shale. Out of these, 2057, 703, 1515, and 1063 wells in the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, and Marcellus, respectively, show evidence of pressure interference between consecutive hydrofractures. For the interfering wells, we calculate their EURs and the distributions of effective gas permeability in the reservoir volumes influenced by these wells. For the non-interfering wells we calculate the lower and upper bounds on their EURs. We show that given the available data, a better field-wide prediction of EUR is impossible. The expected EURs vary between 0.4 and 4.3 Bscf in the Barnett, depending on the well quality. In the other shales the expected well EURs are 0.5 – 3.4 Bcf in the Fayetteville, 1.4 – 7.9 Bcf in the Haynesville, and 1 - 9 Bcf in the Marcellus. The respective mean effective gas permeabilities are 400, 1000, 230, and 800 nanodarcy for the same shales, much high than the core values. Work on the Eagle Ford shale is in progress and will be presented in December.\nIn a shale- horizontal well system, we model rectilinear flow of natural gas as dimensionless nonlinear pseudo-pressure diffusion IVBP with gas sorption on the rock and the multiple planar hydrofractures acting as internal sorbing boundaries. After the initial choked flow, wells must decline as the inverse of the square root of time on production, until the gas pressure starts declining at the midplane of a reservoir cell between two consecutive hydrofractures. At this point of time production decline is exponential. The transition between the square-root-of-time and exponential decline is governed by the characteristic pressure diffusion time, τ, and gas mass in place, M. The dimensionless solution of this IVBP problem reduces the cumulative gas production in all wells to a single universal curve for each play. The ultimate recovery is about 15% of gas-in-place and less so for oil.",

Prior to launch direct validation networks and associated partner institutions were identified world-wide, covering a plethora of precipitation regimes. In the U.S. direct GV efforts focused on use of new operational products such as the NOAA Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor suite (MRMS) for TRMM validation and GPM radiometer algorithm database development. In the post-launch, MRMS products including precipitation rate, types and data quality are being routinely generated to facilitate statistical GV of instantaneous and merged GPM products. To assess precipitation column impacts on product uncertainties, range-gate to pixel-level validation of both Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM microwave imager data are performed using GPM Validation Network (VN) ground radar and satellite data processing software. VN software ingests quality-controlled volumetric radar datasets and geo-matches those data to coincident DPR and radiometer level-II data. When combined MRMS and VN datasets enable more comprehensive interpretation of ground-satellite estimation uncertainties.\nTo support physical validation efforts eight (one) field campaigns have been conducted in the pre (post) launch era. The campaigns span regimes from northern latitude cold-season snow to warm tropical rain. Most recently the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) took place in the mountains of North Carolina and involved combined airborne and ground-based measurements of orographic precipitation and hydrologic processes underneath the GPM Core satellite. One more U.S. GV field campaign (OLYMPEX) is planned for late 2015 and will address cold-season precipitation estimation, process and hydrology in the orographic and oceanic domains of western Washington State. Finally, continuous direct and physical validation measurements are also being conducted at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility multi-radar, gauge and disdrometer facility located in coastal Virginia.\nThis presentation will summarize the evolution of the NASA GPM GV program from pre to post-launch eras and highlight early evaluations of GPM satellite datasets.",

First, a synthetic crystalline aquifer model representing the site of Plœmeur (Brittany, France) is used to give, at any point, references for observables quantities (anthropogenic tracer concentrations of CFC-11, 85Kr and SF6), for non-observables quantities (the TTDs), and for the prediction objective (groundwater renewal times). Second, several LPMs are considered with one, two or three parameters, and are parameterized by fitting the reference anthropogenic concentrations. Third, the reference renewal times obtained from the synthetic model are compared to the renewal times obtained independently from the LPMs. Statistical analyses over the aquifer show that a good fit of the anthropogenic tracer concentrations is a necessary but not sufficient condition for acceptable predictions. The use of only one anthropogenic tracer gives poor predictions differing by 7 to 12 years to the references. The use of two sufficiently different anthropogenic tracers not only reduce the errors but surprisingly yield to very accurate predictions with errors smaller than 3 years. The additional use of a third anthropogenic tracer does not improve the predictive capabilities. Careful a posteriori analyses reveal that reference TTDs have widely varying shapes from well peaked in recharge zones where flows are diverging to broadly distributed in more converging zones. Nonetheless, the same LPM whether it is an inverse Gaussian or a shifted exponential, gives excellent predictions everywhere. In such circulation patterns where dispersive and mixing processes prevail at different scales, broad distributions seem to be more suited than multi-modal or shape-free models.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater systems are often characterized by long travel times relative to human timeframes, and most established techniques for dating groundwater work at the decadal to millennial scale. Viruses are attractive tracers of short (<3 yr) travel times in aquifers because they have unique genetic signatures, are detectable in trace quantities, and are mobile in groundwater. Virus “snaphots” result from infection and disappearance in a human or animal population over time; therefore, the virus snapshot shed in the fecal wastes of an infected population at a specific point in time can serve as a marker for tracking virus and groundwater movement. Examples of virus tracing demonstrate their ability to characterize travel times in high groundwater velocity settings, but are less applicable to low velocity settings due to virus degradation. Because they can trace very short travel times and identify the presence of preferential flowpaths, virus approaches provide new insights about aquifers unavailable from standard hydrogeologic approaches.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the relationships between lava tube morphology, lava effusion rate estimates, and the mechanism of lava tube formation. Effusion rate estimates for extinct lava tubes were calculated using a combination of three-dimensional mapping of lava tube caves, and viscosity models utilizing whole-rock compositions (Giordano et al., 2008, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.), and petrographic data (Harris and Allen, 2008, J. Geophys. Res.). The mechanism of lava tube formation was evaluated using measured tube lengths and effusion rate estimates and comparing these data with observations from Hawaiian channel- and tube-fed flows (Pinkerton and Wilson, 1994, J. Volcanol. Geoth. Res.).\nThree-dimensional map data for lava tube caves were collected using a laser rangefinder to measure the cross-sectional shape and down-tube distance, and a tandem compass/inclinometer to measure the azimuth and inclination between survey stations in the tube. Total tube length consists of the mapped tube length plus the distance between collapse pits and trenches along the trend of the tube.\nEffusion rates were estimated using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, measured mean cross-sectional radii and slope of lava tubes, and estimated effective viscosities of rock samples collected from mapped tubes at temperatures between 1080-1160 °C and water contents of 0-1 wt.%. A lava density of 1560 g/cm3was used for 0.40 vesicle fraction basalt.\nThere is a positive correlation between measured tube lengths and cross-sectional radii (Fig. 1). We propose that this relationship reflects the positive correlation between flow lengths and effusion rates in active Hawaiian channel-fed flows. Measured tube lengths vs. effusion rate estimates were compared with data for Hawaiian channel-fed flows (Fig. 2). The two data sets overlap and have parallel trends. These results suggest that the lava tube caves studied formed by the roofing-over of channel-fed flows or had segments of channel-fed flow.\nWe propose that the lengths and mean cross-sectional radii of lava tubes can be used to evaluate whether or not extinct lava tubes formed by the roofing-over of channel-fed flows. Length and radius measurements of extra-terrestrial lava tubes could provide insight into their formation mechanism independent of in situ observation and rock sampling.",

I believe that giving students the opportunity for increased understanding of their own beliefs and values with respect to the environment will allow them to be more engaged in discussions and debates about environmental policies at the local, national, and global scales. I designed Environmental Geology of Prince William Forest Park (VA), a one-day Field Studies course offered through Northern Virginia Community College, to motivate students to articulate personal convictions about land use. To provide a social context for discussion of environmental issues, students first gave presentations on the demographics, economics, and methods of land use of the people that used the park over the last 400 years. At locations along Quantico Creek, students presented topics that covered geologic processes at work on the landscape, progressive farming methods promoted by some early Virginians, and agricultural methods to stabilize soil and its nutrients. Finally, at the Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine (active 1889–1920) we discussed laborer work conditions and the environmental impact of tailings, as well as the process and effects of remediation. Students tested pH levels in the creek upstream and downstream of the mine as one concrete way to personally observe the results of recent remediation (since 1994), with neutral pH in both locations indicating success. Students wrapped up the course with written reflections, from their own perspectives with respect to socially and environmentally responsible land use, on the geologic processes and human impacts that shaped the park. Social justice and environmental stewardship are two lenses that allow students to find personal meaning and social relevance in geology coursework, as emphasized in this field course. Many students, in this and other courses, have provided feedback indicating that activities I have developed and used along these lines are some of the most engaging and inspiring in their geology coursework.",

            "abstract": "Megathrust rupture is mostly offshore. Using land-based GPS data only, it is difficult to tell whether viscoelastic relaxation, when compared to afterslip, is important in driving post-seismic deformation immediately after the earthquake. GPS/acoustic observations, which measure the displacements of seafloor precision transponder arrays using sea surface platforms equipped with GPS antennas and acoustic transducers, were made by Japan Coast Guard and Tohoku University during and after the 2011 M 9 Tohoku earthquake. Five seafloor sites near the main rupture were reoccupied 4-10 times over the first two years after the earthquake and provide a unique opportunity to study the importance of viscoelastic relaxation. After the large coseismic seaward motion (up to ~ 31 m), the near-trench sites immediately reversed their direction to move landward, opposing the continuing seaward motion of all land sites. This landward motion (~ 30-50 cm over the first year) is faster than the plate convergence rate (8.3 cm/year) and therefore cannot be explained by the relocking of the subduction fault. Using numerical models with transient mantle rheology, we demonstrate that the fast landward motion is caused by viscoelastic relaxation of stresses induced by the asymmetric rupture of the thrust earthquake. For shallow megathrust events, the hanging wall has a lower stiffness and hence always exhibits larger coseismic seaward motion than the landward motion of the footwall. Greater tension is thus induced landward of the rupture area. As the mantle wedge undergoes viscoelastic relaxation, this tension in the upper plate drives the observed landward motion of the trench area. Tests on the effects of mantle rheology, coseismic slip distribution, and plate thickness suggest the wide presence of viscoelastic landward trench motion following large subduction earthquakes. This work indicates that afterslip models assuming a purely elastic Earth substantially overestimated or underestimated afterslip downdip or updip of the rupture zone, respectively. Post-seismic fault behavior has to be studied in the context of a viscoelastic Earth even immediately after the earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Deformation mechanism switches caused by grain-size reduction are a likely principal cause of strain localization, assisted by development of crystallographic preferred orientation, interconnected weak-phase layering, phase changes, and on longer time-scales, shear heating. Grain-size reduction results in a marked increase in the rate of grain-size sensitive creep mechanisms, which include grain-boundary diffusion creep, pressure solution, diffusion- or dislocation-accommodated grain-boundary sliding, and dislocation creep in which grain-boundary migration is the main recovery mechanism (DRX creep). In polyphase systems, grain-boundary sliding plus grain-boundary diffusion may allow the development of a well-mixed fine-grained aggregate, in which the grain size is controlled by the phase showing the greatest degree of grain-size reduction by dynamic recrystallization. The resulting fine-grained mixture resists grain growth, and may be up to three orders of magnitude weaker than the undeformed rock.\nMicrostructural weakening requires a minimum level of stress to produce the required deformation. This buffers the stress, even when there is a velocity boundary condition to the system, along a plate boundary, for example. Shear zones therefore evolve at constant stress, and the cumulative width w of a plate boundary shear zone is a function of the strength of the undeformed rock, the imposed velocity difference, and the rheology of the shear zone material. This allows a first order prediction of w as a function of depth in the lithosphere.",

The frequency of our observations increases dramatically when spacecraft are observing Io in order to complement the data returned by the spacecraft. The Japanese Space Agency’s (JAXA) Hisaki (Sprint-A) mission recently observd the Jupiter system from earth orbit, monitoring the Io Plasma Torus and Jovian aurora. In order to investigate the possible influence of Io volcanism on the torus, we observed Io’s volcanoes from the IRTF in Hawaii between September 2013 and May 2014. We imaged Io at 2.2, 3.5, and 4.8 microns in eclipse and reflected sunlight. We also observed Io during occultation by Jupiter, which allows us to locate and characterize individual volcanic eruptions, with greater spatial accuracy, on the Jupiter-facing hemisphere.\nThe 2013 3.5 micron images of a sunlit Io showed no obvious bright volcanic features. However, further increases in spatial resolution is possible with shift-and-add processing of short exposure images. Preliminary occultation lightcurves from 2013 show moderate levels of activity at Kaneheliki/Janus and Loki, the two volcanic centers most often observed in occultation lightcurves. Loki was much brighter in 2013 than during the New Horizons flyby in 2007, but not as bright as during the Galileo era (see figure).\nFrom February 2014 through May 2014, due to a planned upgrade on the SPEX instrument and an unplanned required repair on the NSFCam2 instrument (both of which we have used previously), we exclusively used the CSHELL instrument as an imager. Unfortunately, CSHELL was not designed for imaging and has limited spatial resolution and photometric precision, complicating image analysis.",

Of central importance to this success has been the development of astrochronologic testing methods for the evaluation of astronomical-climate influence on sedimentation; this can be especially challenging for deep-time strata that lack sufficient independent time control (e.g., radioisotopic data) to unambiguously calibrate observed spatial rhythms to temporal periods. Most deep-time (pre-Pleistocene) astrochronologic testing methods fall into one of two categories: (1) those that test for expected amplitude or frequency modulation imposed by an astronomical signal, or (2) those that test for bedding hierarchies (\"frequency ratios\") that are predicted by the dominant astronomical periods. In this talk, I discuss the historical context of these methods, recent advances that overcome subjective evaluation and circular reasoning, and their implementation in a new “open source” software package for astrochronology (Meyers, 2014, astrochron: An R Package for Astrochronology).",

These measurements will provide us the most in depth examination of the origin, structure and evolution of the solar wind. The near co-rotation phases of the orbiter will enable the most accurate mapping of in-situ structures back to their solar sources. Measurements of solar wind composition and heavy ion kinetic properties enable characterization of the sources, transport mechanisms and acceleration processes of the solar wind. This presentation will focus on the current state of in-situ studies of heavy ions in the solar wind and their implications for the sources of the solar wind, the nature of structure and variability in the solar wind, and the acceleration of particles. Additionally, we will also discuss opportunities for coordinated measurements across the payloads of Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe in order to answer key outstanding science questions of central interest to the Solar and Heliophysics communities.",

            "abstract": "Designing climate change curricular materials suitable for wide adoption across institutions and academic disciplines (including those outside of the geosciences) requires collaboration among faculty at different types of institutions and consideration of a variety of student populations, learning styles, and course formats. The Interdisciplinary Teaching of Geoscience for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) project, an NSF STEP Center program, provides opportunities for faculty to develop 2-3 week teaching modules to engage students in understanding the intersections between geoscience topics and societal issues. From 2012-2014, a team of 3 faculty from a liberal arts college, comprehensive university, and community college developed, implemented, assessed, and revised a 2-3 week module for introductory undergraduates entitled \"Climate of change: interactions and feedbacks between water, air, and ice\". The module uses authentic atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere data from several regions to illustrate how climate impacts human societies and that the climate system has interacting components complicated by feedbacks, uncertainties, and human behavioral decisions. Students also consider past and present human adaptations to climate fluctuations. The module was piloted in introductory geology, meteorology, and oceanography courses during the 2012-2013 academic year, during which time formative and summative assessments were administered and used to modify the curricular materials. We will provide an overview of the module's content, instructional strategies involved in implementing the module, and methods of formative and summative assessment. We will also report on lessons learned during the development, piloting, revision, and publishing process, the importance of fostering partnerships between faculty from different institution types, and design approaches that promote widespread adoption of climate curricular materials.",

            "abstract": "Xenoliths in the Navajo Volcanic Field diatremes include HP-LT and UHP metamorphic eclogites (with lawsonite, phengite, coesite, zircon), exotic hydrous Cr-omphacitites (with guyanaite - CrOOH, carmichaelite, eskolaite, tawmawite, redledgeite) and hydrous and anhydrous peridotite, pyroxenite and lower crustal rocks. The eclogites (primarily dated at 30-80 Ma), omphacitites (30 Ma) and some of the (serpentinized) peridotites were derived from the subducted Farallon Plate (and possibly near-trench mantle wedge material accompanying the slab) from the flat slab by the diatremes at 30 Ma, approximately 700 km from the trench. Dehydration reactions in this assemblage (primarily prograde metamorphism of serpentinite yielding peridotite but also breakdown of guyanaite to eskolaite + water) provided water that hydrated overlying mantle materials (garnet and spinel peridotite to antigorite/chlorite serpentinite, garnet pyroxenite to chlorite-bearing eclogite, garnet and spinel pyroxenite to pargasite + chlorite). The accompanying volume expansion contributed to uplift of the Colorado Plateau, as originally suggested by Hess (1955). Phengite and possibly lawsonite remained stable and continued to carry water to greater depths. Guyanaite is stable to over 13.5 GPa and can transport water at least into the transition zone and thus may be a vehicle for hydrating ringwoodite in the transition zone (the present location of the Farallon slab). It is not known to how deep other hydrous minerals in these assemblages are stable (e.g., carmichaelite, redledgeite, tawmawite) but they, too, have potential for carrying water deep into the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimatic observations are, by nature, imperfect recorders of climate variables. Empirical approaches to their calibration are challenged by the presence of multiple sources of uncertainty, which may confound the interpretation of signals and the identifiability of the noise. In this talk, I will demonstrate the utility of proxy system models (PSMs, Evans et al, 2013, 10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.05.024) to quantify the impact of all known sources of uncertainty. PSMs explicitly encode the mechanistic knowledge of the physical, chemical, biological and geological processes from which paleoclimatic observations arise. PSMs may be divided into sensor, archive and observation components, all of which may conspire to obscure climate signals in actual paleo-observations.\nAs an example, we couple a PSM for the δ18O of speleothem calcite to an isotope-enabled climate model (Dee et al, submitted) to analyze the potential of this measurement as a proxy for precipitation amount. A simple soil/karst model (Partin et al, 2013, 10.1130/G34718.1) is used as sensor model, while a hiatus-permitting chronological model (Haslett & Parnell, 2008, 10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x) is used as part of the observation model. This subdivision allows us to explicitly model the transformation from precipitation amount to speleothem calcite δ18O as a multi-stage process via a physical and chemical sensor model, and a stochastic archive model. By illustrating the PSM's behavior within the context of the climate simulations, we show how estimates of climate variability may be affected by each submodel's transformation of the signal. By specifying idealized climate signals(periodic vs. episodic, slow vs. fast) to the PSM, we investigate how frequency and amplitude patterns are modulated by sensor and archive submodels. To the extent that the PSM and the climate models are representative of real world processes, then the results may help us more accurately interpret existing paleodata, characterize their uncertainties, and design sampling strategies that exploit their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses.",

There are many different versions of the data life cycle, but they all follow a similar basic pattern: plan, collect, ingest, asses, preserve, discover, and reuse. The process is often interpreted in a fairly linear fashion despite it being a cycle conceptually. More recently at GeoData 2014 and elsewhere, questions have been raised about the utility of the data life cycle as it is currently represented. We are proposing to the community a re-examination of the data life cycle using an agile lens. Our goal is not to deploy agile methods, but to use agile principles as a heuristic to think about how to incorporate data stewardship across the scientific process from proposal stage to research and beyond. We will present alternative conceptualizations of the data life cycle with a goal to solicit feedback and to develop a new model for conceiving and describing the overall data stewardship process. We seek to re-examine past assumptions and shed new light on the challenges and necessity of data stewardship.

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity investigated sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a diversity of fluvio-lacustrine settings. The entire science payload was employed to characterize the mineralogy and chemistry of the Sheepbed mudstone at Yellowknife Bay and the Windjana sandstone at the Kimberley. Data from the CheMin instrument, a transmission X-ray diffractometer, were used to determine the quantitative mineralogy of both samples. The Sheepbed mudstone contains detrital basaltic minerals, calcium sulfates, iron oxides or hydroxides, iron sulfides, trioctahedral smectite, and amorphous material. The mineral assemblage and chemical data from APXS suggest that the trioctahedral smectite and magnetite formed authigenically as a result of alteration of olivine. The apparent lack of higher-grade phyllosilicates (e.g., illite and chlorite) and the presence of anhydrite indicate diagenesis at ~50-80 ºC. The mineralogy of the Windjana sandstone is different than the Sheepbed mudstone. Windjana contains significant abundances of K-feldspar, low- and high-Ca pyroxenes, magnetite, phyllosilicates, and amorphous material. At least two distinct phyllosilicate phases exist: a 10 Å phase and a component that is expanded with a peak at ~11.8 Å. The identity of the expanded phase is currently unknown, but could be a smectite with interlayer H2O, and the 10 Å phase could be illite or collapsed smectite. Further work is necessary to characterize the phyllosilicates, but the presence of illite could suggest that Windjana experienced burial diagenesis. Candidates for the cementing agents include fine-grained phyllosilicates, Fe-oxides, and/or amorphous material. Interpretations of CheMin data from the Windjana sandstone are ongoing at the time of writing, but we will present an estimate of the composition of the amorphous material from mass balance calculations using the APXS bulk chemistry and quantitative mineralogy from CheMin.",

            "abstract": "Yardangs are streamlined bedforms sculpted by the wind and wind-blown sand. They can form as relatively resistant exposed rocks erode more slowly than surrounding exposed rocks, thus causing the more resistant rocks to stand higher in the landscape and deflect the wind and wind-blown sand into adjacent troughs in a positive feedback. How this feedback gives rise to streamlined forms that locally have a consistent size is not well understood theoretically. In this study we combine field measurements in the yardangs of Ocotillo Wells SVRA with analyses of airborne and terrestrial lidar datasets and numerical modeling to quantify and understand the controls on yardang morphology. The classic model for yardang morphology is that they evolve to an ideal 4:1 length-to-width aspect ratio that minimizes aerodynamic drag. We show using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling that this model is incorrect: the 4:1 aspect ratio is the value corresponding to minimum drag for free bodies, i.e. obstacles around which air flows on all sides. Yardangs, in contrast, are embedded in Earth’s surface. For such rough streamlined half-bodies, the aspect ratio corresponding to minimum drag is larger than 20:1. As an alternative to the minimum-drag model, we propose that the aspect ratio of yardangs not significantly influenced by structural controls is controlled by the angle of dispersion of the aerodynamic jet created as deflected wind and wind-blown sand exits the troughs between incipient yardang noses. Aerodynamic jets have a universal dispersion angle of 11.8 degrees, thus predicting a yardang aspect ratio of ~5:1. We developed a landscape evolution model that combines the physics of boundary layer flow with aeolian saltation and bedrock erosion to form yardangs with a range of sizes and aspect ratios similar to those observed in nature. Yardangs with aspect ratios both larger and smaller than 5:1 occur in the model since the strike and dip of the resistant rock unit also exerts a first-order control. We report on the analysis of a 1 m/pixel airborne-lidar-derived DEM of all of the yardangs in Ocotillo Wells, a map of erosion/deposition obtained from terrestrial-laser-scanning-derived DEMs obtained 1 year apart, 4D data for wind velocities and aeolian sediment fluxes around the yardangs, and the orientations and strengths of rock strata.",

More than 15 years of substantive science concerning hydrology, hydraulics, sediment transport, geomorphology, aquatic and fish ecology, riparian ecology, and socio-economics has yielded significant insights that guide experimental river management initiatives, such as a new protocol to annually release sediment-triggered controlled floods; administratively called the High Flow Experimental Protocol (HFEP). Implementation of the HFEP requires nearly real-time monitoring of sediment delivery from key sand producing tributaries, transport in and calculation of sand mass balance in segments of the Colorado River, and defined uncertainty of those processes and conditions (see: http://www.gcmrc.gov/). The HFEP aims to rebuild sandbars within the active channel, but many stakeholders remain focused on other aquatic ecosystem, riparian ecosystem, archaeological resources, or cultural values that are linked in complex ways to active channel conditions. Tension exists within the GCDAMP about how funding is allocated for innovative data collection, analysis, and publication strategies that allow implementation of the HFEP, and to also measure derivative resource conditions about which some stakeholders have concern. Monitoring and research initiatives that attempt to incorporate traditional cultural values also have high uncertainty when resource condition is linked with the simple implementation paradigm of the HFEP. Thus, the GCDAMP is faced with the complex challenge of allocating sufficient resources to monitor active channel processes and characteristics, resolve remaining scientific uncertainties, and develop new strategies for incorporating science insights into engineering and policy decisions, while also monitoring terrestrial resources supported by stakeholders but only indirectly linked with dam operations. The challenge of balancing these scientific and adaptive management objectives is substantial.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric dust records in ice cores and marine sediment provide important information regarding global climate, tectonics, and ocean-atmospheric interactions over many different timescales. In particular, marine records from the northwest Pacific are of critical importance to our understanding of the development of the Asian Monsoon, the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation, and other important climatic features. Changes in dust sources have been documented over short timescales related to monsoonal dynamics; however, studies over much longer timescales commonly consider canonical “Chinese Loess” as the sole source of Asian dust. Here we present a new marine record from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1149 that indicates the clear presence of at least two different sources of Asian dust over the past 60 Ma.\nUsing a multi-elemental geochemical and statistical approach we have resolved two disparate eolian dust inputs to Site 1149, in addition to two different ash sources. The first dust source appears to be Chinese Loess (CL); whereas, the second dust source is compositionally distinct from CL and is similar in composition to general Upper Continental Crust. These two sources show contrasting accumulation patterns through the Cenozoic. Our results confirm previous studies that show the CL source increasing in importance over the past 8 Ma. Further, our data show that the second eolian input from Asia decreases in importance from 60 Ma to ~22 Ma. This second dust source shows variability throughout the Cenozoic that can be related to major climatic events and terrestrial climate records from China, yet ceases to be important younger than ~22 Ma. The time period from ~25-20 Ma, therefore, appears to represent a fundamental transition in the hydrologic behavior of the Asian interior. That there are two important dust sources through the Cenozoic, rather than just the single “Chinese Loess”, offers new opportunities for inferring the climate and tectonic evolution of Asia and the northern hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Subsequent to the release of the 2007 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Province of British Columbia in Canada became an international leader in the development and implementation of innovative climate change mitigation policies. These include, but are not limited to, the 2008 Greenhouse Gas Reductions Target Act, the 2008 Carbon Tax Act and the 2010 Clean Energy Act. British Columbia’s Cleantech sector quickly responded to, and thrived as a result of, the signal sent by government to the market. But with a change in Premier in 2011 came a change in priorities. A number of the previous initiatives have either been weakened or no longer followed through with as the Province sets its vision of being a major exporter of Liquified Natural Gas.\nAs a member of the British Columbia Climate Action Team set up by Premier Gordon Campbell in 2007 to provide advice to government on a variety of policy-related matters, I was fortunate to be able to watch first hand as the Province aggressively moved towards reducing its Greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than stand on the sidelines as the government lost its direction on the climate file I chose to run with the BC Green Party in the 2013 provincial election. I was subsequently elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly representing the constituents of Oak Bay Gordon Head.\nWhile science can and should inform policy deliberations, in and of itself, science cannot and should not prescribe policy outcomes. Whether or not we deal with today’s challenge of climate change boils down to a question of intergeneration equity. Does the present generation owe anything to future generations in terms of the quality of the environment that they inherit? Many of today’s elected decision-makers are focused on short-term decision-making.

            "abstract": "Rangitoto is a small basaltic shield volcano representing the most recent and most voluminous episode of volcanism in the Auckland Volcanic Field, New Zealand. Auckland City is built on the field, and hence, Rangitoto’s importance in hazard-risk modelling. The symmetrical edifice, ~6 km wide and 260 m high, has volume of 1.78 km3. It comprises summit scoria cones and a lava field. However, the lack of deep erosion dissection has prevented the development of an eruptive stratigraphy. Previous studies suggested construction in a relatively short interval at 550–500 yrs BP. However, microscopic tephra have been interpreted as evidence of intermittent activity from 1498 +/- 140 to 504 +/- 6 yrs BP, a longevity of 1000 years. A 150-m-deep hole was drilled through the edifice in February 2014 to obtain a continuous core record. The result is an unparalleled stratigraphy of the evolution of a small shield volcano. The upper 128 m of core comprises at least 27 lava flows with thicknesses in the range 0.3-15 m, representing the main shield-building phase. Underlying marine sediments are interbedded with 8 m of pyroclastic lapilli, and a thin lava flow, representing the explosive phreatomagmatic birth of the volcano. Preliminary geochemical analyses reveal suite of relatively uniform transitional basalts (MgO = 8.1 to 9.7 wt %). However, 4 compositional groups are distinguished that were erupted in sequential order. High-MgO magmas were erupted first, followed by a two more heterogeneous groups displaying differentiation trends with time. Finally, distinct low-MgO basalts were erupted. Each magma type appears to represent a new magma batch. The core places the magma types in a time series, which can be correlated to the surface lava field. Hence, allowing a geometrical reconstruction of the shield growth. Additional petrologic investigations are providing insight to magmatic ascent processes, while radiocarbon and paleomagnetic secular variation studies will reveal the duration of activity.",

            "abstract": "Launched aboard NASA’s Terra satellite in December 1999, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has opened new vistas in remote sensing of our home planet. Its 9 pushbroom cameras provide as many view angles ranging from 70 degrees forward to 70 degrees backward along Terra’s flight track, in four visible and near-infrared spectral bands. MISR’s well-calibrated, accurately co-registered, and moderately high spatial resolution radiance images have been coupled with novel data processing algorithms to mine the information content of angular reflectance anisotropy and multi-camera stereophotogrammetry, enabling new perspectives on the 3-D structure and dynamics of Earth’s atmosphere and surface in support of climate and environmental research. Beginning with “first light” in February 2000, the nearly 15-year (and counting) MISR observational record provides an unprecedented data set with applications to multiple disciplines, documenting regional, global, short-term, and long-term changes in aerosol optical depths, aerosol type, near-surface particulate pollution, spectral top-of-atmosphere and surface albedos, aerosol plume-top and cloud-top heights, height-resolved cloud fractions, atmospheric motion vectors, and the structure of vegetated and ice-covered terrains. Recent computational advances include aerosol retrievals at finer spatial resolution than previously possible, and production of near-real time tropospheric winds with a latency of less than 3 hours, making possible for the first time the assimilation of MISR data into weather forecast models. In addition, recent algorithmic and technological developments provide the means of using and acquiring multi-angular data in new ways, such as the application of optical tomography to map 3-D atmospheric structure; building smaller multi-angle instruments in the future; and extending the multi-angular imaging methodology to the ultraviolet, shortwave infrared, and polarimetric realms. Such advances promise further enhancements to the observational power of the remote sensing approaches that MISR has pioneered.",

The AIST Program aims to support all phases of NASA’s Earth Science program with the goal of enabling new observations and information products, increasing the accessibility and use of Earth observations, and reducing the risk and cost of satellite and ground based information systems. Recent initiatives feature computational technologies to improve information extracted from data streams or model outputs and researchers’ tools for Big Data analytics. Data-centric technologies enable research communities to facilitate collaboration and increase the speed with which results are produced and published. In the future NASA anticipates more small satellites (e.g., CubeSats), mobile drones and ground-based in-situ sensors will advance the state-of-the-art regarding how scientific observations are performed, given the flexibility, cost and deployment advantages of new operations technologies. This paper reviews the success of the program and the lessons learned. Infusion of these technologies is challenging and the paper discusses the obstacles and strategies to adoption by the earth science research and application efforts. It also describes alternative perspectives for the future program direction and for realizing the value in the steps to transform observations from sensors to data, to information, and to knowledge, namely: sensor measurement concepts development; data acquisition and management; data product generation; and data exploitation for science and applications.",

            "abstract": "Recent efforts in reconstructing climate variations and forcings for the Common Era have made this period ideal for studying the role of external forcing with numerical models. Large ensembles are needed to best evaluate model capabilities against paleoclimate records, as well as assess uncertainties in the attribution of a regional response to a particular forcing in the presence of intrinsic variability. The CESM Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME) will be used to investigate interannual to multi-centennial scale climate variations in response to natural and anthropogenic forcing.\nThe CESM-LME is performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM with CAM5) at ~2o horizontal resolution in the atmosphere and land components and ~1oresolution in the ocean and sea-ice components. The CESM-LME is nearly completed, and consists of more than 28 simulations over the period from 850 to 2005CE. Ten members use a full-set of CMIP5/PMIP3 forcings (volcanic aerosols, solar variability, orbital variations, greenhouse gases, and land use changes). The remaining runs consist of smaller sets with single transient forcings. Two pre-industrial controls with constant forcings at 850CE and 1850CE values enable a characterization of unforced variability. Upon release on the Earth System Grid, the CESM-LME will serve as a tremendous community resource, enabling investigations into the relative roles of external forcing and intrinsic climate variability and the impact of recent anthropogenic climate forcing over natural background variability of the Common Era.\nResults presented will focus on the tropical response to the largest tropical volcanic eruptions of the last millennium: Samalas in 1257-1258, Kuwae in ~1452 and Tambora in 1815. The CESM-LME fully-forced and volcanic-only ensembles demonstrate the impact of these large volcanic eruptions on decadal scale regional climate variations, and help assess the likelihood to trigger an ENSO in the immediate aftermath of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "With the two STEREO spacecraft on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, pointing the high gain antenna at Earth means that it's also pointed very close to the Sun. This has resulted in unexpectedly high temperatures in the antenna feed horns on both spacecraft, and is forcing the mission operations team to take corrective action, starting in August 2014 for STEREO Ahead, and December 2014 for STEREO Behind. By off-pointing the antennas to use one of the lower power side lobes instead of the main lobe, the feed horn temperatures can be kept at a safe level while still allowing reliable communication with the spacecraft. However, the amount of telemetry that can be brought down will be highly reduced. Even so, significant science will still be possible from STEREO's unique position on the solar far side. We will discuss the science and space weather products that will be available from each STEREO instrument, when those products will be available, and how they will be used. Some data, including the regular space weather beacon products, will be brought down for an average of a few hours each day during the daily real-time passes, while the in situ and radio beacon data will be stored on the onboard recorder to provide a continuous 24-hour coverage for eventual downlink once the spacecraft is back to normal operations.",

            "abstract": "This paper synthesises evidence from Late Quaternary pollen diagrams from across Island SE Asia to show that what appears to be anthopogenic forest modification started more than 50,000 years ago. Initially disturbance of forests was by fire, during interstadials when successional processes would otherwise have led to closed canopy forest. It is hypothesised that the resultant habitats would have provided accessible broad-spectrum resources to mobile foraging populations. During the Holocene, there is some evidence for the early interchange and propagation of economically-important plants, notably between New Guinea and Borneo. I use GIS to chart patterns of floral disturbance through the Holocene, most probably linked to diverse land management and food production strategies. We need a new wave of pollen and charcoal-based studies plus plant macrofossil work on many archaeological sites across the region to test and substantiate this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "The Colorado Plateau is an exceptional region of high elevation, extensive canyonlands, and minor crustal deformation in the North American Cordillera. Numerous low-temperature thermochronology studies have attempted to constrain the timing and rate(s) at which this enigmatic Cenozoic landscape developed. However, such studies have struggled to robustly interpret the thermal histories of the Plateau’s rocks because most contain detrital crystals with diverse time-temperature histories that are partially reset, which confounds efforts to see clear thermochronologic signals of Cenozoic erosion. To overcome this challenge, we targeted sample collection from places on the Plateau where rock thermal histories were reset by Oligocene magmatism: the thermal aureoles of laccolith-cored Henry, La Sal, and Abajo mountains. There, shallow plutons (i.e., laccoliths) heated the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks ca. 26 Ma, locally resetting apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He ages so they record subsequent Miocene-Quaternary cooling. Sandstone samples from each mountain range yield single-crystal apatite He ages that vary with effective U concentration (eU). In these key samples, minimum He ages are ~5 Ma with eU <10 ppm, and maximum ages are ~25-20 Ma with eU >60 ppm. We model and interpret these age-eU patterns together with (1) stratigraphic constraints, (2) the timing of magmatic heating constrained by zircon U/Pb laccolith geochronology, and (3) the extent of resetting temperatures >100 ˚C by apatite fission track analysis. Results require prolonged sample residence in the apatite He partial retention zone (40-60 ˚C) from 25 to <10 Ma; best fit time-temperature solutions show onset of rapid cooling to surface temperatures in the Plio-Pleistocene. We interpret this as an erosional event that removed ~1.5 km at time-averaged erosion rates between 0.3 and >1 km/Myr in parts of the Henry and Abajo mountains. The Plio-Pleistocene was a time of change both regionally and globally, as Colorado River base level dropped with its final integration through the Grand Canyon ca. 5.3 Ma and global climate cooling possibly enhanced erosion rates on the Plateau’s high-relief mountain ranges. Ongoing work evaluates the relationship between the erosion of the laccolith-cored ranges and regional denudation.",

            "abstract": "The dynamic processes operating within crustal magma reservoirs control many aspects of the chemical composition of erupted magmas, and crystals in volcanic rocks can provide a temporally-constrained archive of these changing environments. A new compilation of 238U-230Th ages of accessory phases and 238U-230Th-226Ra ages of bulk mineral separates of major phases documents that crystals in individual samples often have ages spanning most of the history of a volcanic center. Somewhat surprisingly, this observation holds for surface analyses as well as interior analyses, indicating that the latest stages of growth took place at different times for different grains. Nevertheless, average ages of surfaces are younger than interiors (as expected), and the dominant surface age population is often within error of eruption age. In contrast to accessory phase ages, less than half of the bulk separate 238U-230Th-226Ra ages for major phases are more than 10 kyr older than eruption. This suggests that major phases may in general reflect a later stage of development of an eruptible magma body than do accessory phases, or that the extent of discordance between ages of major and accessory phases reflects the extent to which a crystal mush was remobilized during processes leading to eruption. Crystal ages are most useful for illuminating magmatic processes when combined with crystal-scale trace-element or isotopic data, and I will present several case studies where such combined data sets exist. For example, at Yellowstone and at Okataina Caldera Complex, New Zealand, the combination zircon surface and interior analyses (of age, Hf isotopic, and trace-element data) with bulk dating and in-situ trace-element and isotopic compositions of feldspar allows a comparison of the early history of storage in a crystal mush with the later history of melt extraction and further crystallization prior to eruption, thus tracking development of erupted magma bodies from storage through eruption.",

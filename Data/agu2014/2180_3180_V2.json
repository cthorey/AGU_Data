            "abstract": "Geoscience data comes in many flavors that are determined by type of data such as continous on a grid or mesh or discrete colelcted at point either as one time samples or a stream of data coming of sensors, but coudl also encompass digital files of any time type such text files, WORD or EXCEL documents, or audio and video files. We present a storage facility that is comprsed of 6 nodes each of speciaized to host a certain data type: grid based data (netCDF on a THREDDS server), GIS data (shapefiles using GeoServer), point time series data (CUAHSI ODM), sample data (EDBS), and any digital data (RAMADAA) plus a server fro Remote sensing data and its products. While there is overlap in data type storage capabilities (rasters can go into several of these nodes) we prefer to use dedicated storage facilities that are a) freeware, and b) have a good degree of maturity, and c) have shown their utility for stroing a cetain type. In addition it allows to place these commonly used software stacks and storage solutiosn side-by-side to develop interoprability strategies. We have used a DRUPAL based system to handle user regoistration and authentication, and also use the system for data submission and data search. In support for tis system we developed an extensive controlled vocabulary system that is an amalgamation of various CVs used in the geosciecne community in order to achieve as high a degree of recognition, such the CF conventions, CUAHSI Cvs, , NASA (GCMD), EPA and USGS taxonomies, GEMET, in addition to ontological representations such as SWEET.",

            "abstract": "The morphology of lava flows depends largely on rheological properties (viscosity, yield strength), which in turn vary with its physical properties (composition, crystal and bubble fraction, temperature). We are investigating how these properties vary in space and time (1) along and across a flow at a particular instant in time, and (2) for a single quantum of magma from vent to final emplacement. Our study area is Pacaya (Guatemala). Its latest effusive eruption begun on January 10th 2014 and produced two lava flows emitted from newly-formed vents, aligned NW-SE across the summit. Flow surface profiles were obtained with a Laser Range Finder, and extensive sampling was conducted on both flows while still active or shortly afterwards. The lavas are basalts (SiO2 = 50-51.5%), the SE flow being slightly more evolved than the NW one. Both flows are less alkali-rich than historical flows, even as recently as 2010. The mineralogy consists of plagioclase, olivine, pyroxenes, and minor oxides. The samples are highly crystalline (~60% phenocrysts + microlites) and considerably vesicular (≥25%, decreasing downflow), with mostly interconnected porosity. The flow velocity, estimated from videos taken in the field, decreased from ~2.8 m/s by the vent, where the flow surface is mostly incandescent pahoehoe, to ~0.5 m/s about 1 km downflow, where the surface is mostly dark `a`a. This velocity decrease is consistent with cooling and crust formation, as well as a decrease in slope from 45° to 4°. The effects of crystallization on the evolution of the 2014 lavas rheology are being investigated through concentric cylinder and parallel plate viscometry, and will be compared to the 2010 data. Lavas erupted in 2010 have a viscosity of ~75 Pa s at their liquidus temperature of ~1260˚C, increasing to ~250 Pa s at ~1240˚C (~25% crystals) and ~800 Pa s at ~1225˚C (~36% crystals). At subliquidus conditions, lava rheology is distinctly non-Netonian, and best fit with a power-law rheology, but yield strengths are low even at high crystal fractions (e.g. ~140 Pa at 42% crystals). Rheological gradients are therefore expected to be very strong even within the incandescent flow interior. Experimental study of the 2014 lavas, combined with observations of their emplacement, will allow us to better understand how evolving rheology affects final flow morphology.",

We measured the chemistry and toxicity of unfiltered runoff resulting from rain events simulated from 5 hours to 111 days after application of CT or asphalt (AS) sealcoat. PAHs and N-heterocycles were measured by GC/EIMS. Toxicity tests were done with Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas exposed 48 hours to undiluted and diluted (1 part runoff 9 parts control water) runoff under ambient lighting. Organisms were then transferred to fresh control water and subjected to a 4-hour pulse of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Concentrations of 2- and 3-ringed PAHs and N-heterocycles in CT runoff, initially high (sum of 6 PAHs, 220 µg/L; sum of 7 N-heterocycles, 904 µg/L), decreased rapidly, whereas concentrations of 4-, 5- and 6-ringed PAHs more than doubled by 7 days after application (sum of 9 PAHs, 378 µg/L) and remained elevated 111 days after application (sum of 9 PAHs, 283 µg/L). Concentrations of PAHs and N-heterocycles in AS sealcoated runoff followed a similar pattern, but were ~10 times lower than those in CT runoff; concentrations in a sample of runoff from unsealed asphalt pavement were near or less than the detection limit. Organisms exposed to samples of undiluted CT-runoff collected during the 36 days following CT sealcoat application (no UVR exposure) experienced 100% mortality. Mortality (as much as 100%) of organisms exposed to the 10% dilution of CT runoff or to undiluted AS runoff occurred only with UVR; mortality of organisms exposed to the 10% solution of AS runoff and UVR was minimal. Results demonstrate that freshly CT-sealed parking lots and driveways are \"hot spots\" of PAH and N-heterocycle contamination and that prolonged \"hot moments\" of toxicity follow CT sealcoat application.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridges constitute a fundamental component of the global plate tectonic system. The classical view of ridges is of symmetric system, where plates diverge, generating a mostly passive upwelling immediately underneath the ridge axis. However, observations of mid-ocean ridges draw quite a different picture. At the Southern East Pacific Rise, plate subsidence (related to plate age) occurs at different rates on the Pacific and Nazca plates, implying different rates of accretion on each side of the ridge. At greater depth, the melting region extends much further beneath the Pacific plate than the Nazca plate. Asymmetry is also evident in slow spreading center. For examples, at the 13°N segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, isochrons are more widely spaced on the American side than the European side. Core complexes along the axis are another manifestation of asymmetric accretion at that location.\nIn this contribution, we seek to understand how is the melting system affected by ridge asymmetry. First, we discuss the different ways that an asymmetric ridge may develop. We present an analytical solution of mantle flow in the mantle underneath spreading centers that considers 1) different rates of accretion in on the two plates; 2) migration of the ridge system with respect to the underlying mantle (Couette flow in the asthenosphere); 3) mantle wind (Poiseuille flow in the asthenosphere); 4) different slopes of the lithosphere underneath each plate; and 5) any combination of the above. These solutions assume an isoviscous mantle underneath the lithosphere. Asymmetry in mantle flow is observed in each case. The temperature field associated with each case implies that melting is suppressed by the asymmetric accretion, although deeper processes have little effect on melting. As asymmetric accretion is thought to develop when melt flux to the axis is reduced, there is the possibility of a positive feedback that forces segments to switch between symmetric and asymmetric spreading. However, the effect of asymmetry is reduced in numerical models with temperature-dependent viscosity as the thermally defined slope of the lithosphere counteracts the effect of asymmetric accretion.",

            "abstract": "Although sediment supply is recognized as a fundamental driver of fluvial processes, measuring how dams affect sediment regimes and incorporating such knowledge into management strategies remains challenging. To determine the influences of damming, tributary supply, and valley morphology and sediment storage on downstream sediment supply in a dryland river, the Bill Williams River (BWR) in western Arizona, we measured basin erosion rates using cosmogenic nuclide analysis of beryllium-10 (10Be) at sites upstream and downstream of a dam along the BWR, as well as from tributaries downstream of the dam. Riverbed sediment mixing calculations were used to test if the dam, which blocks sediment supply from the upper 85% of the basin’s drainage area, increases the proportion of tributary sediment to residual upstream sediment in mainstem samples downstream of the dam. Erosion rates in the BWR watershed are more than twice as large in the upper catchment (136 t km-2 yr-1) than in tributaries downstream of Alamo Dam (61 t km-2 yr-1). Tributaries downstream of the dam have little influence on mainstem sediment dynamics. The effect of the dam on reducing sediment supply is limited, however, because of the presence of large alluvial valleys along the mainstem BWR downstream of the dam that store substantial sediment and mitigate supply reductions from the upper watershed. These inferences, from our 10Be derived erosion rates and mixing calculations, are consistent with field observations of downstream changes in bed material size, which suggest that sediment-deficit conditions are restricted to a 10 km reach downstream of the dam, and limited reservoir bathymetry data. Many studies have suggested that tributary sediment inputs downstream of dams play a key role in mitigating dam-induced sediment deficits, but here we show that in a dryland river with ephemeral tributaries, sediment stored in alluvial valleys can also play a key role and in some cases trumps the role of tributaries.",

            "abstract": "The lack of a high-resolution, long-term Early Cretaceous paleotemperature record hampers a full-scale comprehension, as well as a more holistic approach, to Early Cretaceous climate changes. We present an extended compilation of belemnite-based oxygen, carbon and strontium isotope records covering the Berriasian to middle Albian from the Vocontian Basin (SE France). Integrated with paleontological and sedimentological evidences, this dataset clearly demonstrates that three intervals of cold climatic conditions have taken place during the Early Cretaceous greenhouse world. More specifically, these are taken place during (1) the late Valanginian-earliest Hauterivian, (2) the late early Aptian and (3) the latest Aptian - earliest Albian. Each of these intervals is associated with high amplitude sea-level fluctuations, pointing at transient installations of polar ice caps. As evidenced by carbon isotope positive excursions, each cold episode is associated with enhanced burial of organic matter on a global scale. Moreover, there is a very good match between the timing and size of large igneous provinces eruptions and the amplitude of Early Cretaceous warming episodes. Altogether, these observations confirm the instrumental role of atmospheric CO2 variations in the making of Mesozoic climate change. On a long-term perspective, during the Early Cretaceous, the coupling of global paleotemperature and seawater strontium isotopic ratio is best explained by temperature-controlled changes of continental crust weathering rates.",

            "abstract": "The challenge of quantifying surface water-groundwater interactions has led to the development of several techniques, from centimeter-scale probes to whole-system tracers, including chemical, thermal, and electrical methods. We co-applied several of these techniques within a single experimental reach in a third-order stream. The techniques that we used include: conservative and “smart” reactive solute tracer tests, measurement of hydraulic heads, distributed temperature sensing, vertical profiles of solute tracer and temperature in the streambed, and electrical resistivity imaging. Results from the field experiment consistently indicated that surface water-groundwater interactions were not spatially expansive, but were high in flux through a shallow hyporheic zone surrounding the 450-m study reach. The NaCl and resazurin tracers suggested different surface-subsurface exchange patterns between the upper two thirds and lower third of the reach. Subsurface sampling of tracers and vertical thermal profiles quantified relatively high fluxes through a 10–20 cm deep hyporheic zone with chemical reactivity of resazurin indicated at 3, 6 and 9 cm sampling depths. Monitoring of hydraulic gradients along transects starting ~ 40 m away from the stream indicated that groundwater flow prevented the development of a larger hyporheic zone, which was shown (from MINIPOINT samples) to progressively vanish from the stream thalweg with depth in the streambed and distance toward the banks. Finally, FO-DTS did not detect extensive inflow of groundwater into the stream and electrical resistivity imaging showed limited large-scale hyporheic exchange. From the experience gained in our experiment, we recommend the following reasoning to decide which technique(s) should be implemented in a particular study: 1) clearly define the nature of the questions to be addressed, i.e., physical, biological or chemical processes, 2) identify the spatial and temporal scales that want to be covered explicitly and those required to provide an appropriate context for interpretation, and 3) engage in collaborative research efforts that maximize the generation of mechanistic understanding and reduce the costs of implementing multiple techniques.",

The varying concentration of this drug was analyzed in a mature karst spring following a precipitation event. The results show that carbamazepine is an indicator of wastewater entering the system through a fast flow pathway, leading to an increase of the drug concentrations in spring water shortly after a strong rainfall event. The analysis of the breakthrough curve of carbamazepine along with the electrical conductivity signal and major ions chemograph allowed the development of a conceptual model for precipitation event-based flow and transport in the investigated karst system. Furthermore the amount of newly recharged water and the mass of carbamazepine reaching the aquifer system during the event could be estimated using a simple mixing approach. The distance between the karst spring and the potential carbamazepine source was estimated by the combination of results from artificial tracer tests and the carbamazepine breakthrough curve. The assessment of spring responses to precipitation event using persistent drugs like carbamazepine helps assess the effect of waste water contamination at a spring and gives therefore insights to the specific vulnerability of a karst spring.",

            "abstract": "Serpentine deposits on Mars have generated significant interest because byproducts of serpentinization, H2 and CH4, can be important energy sources for subsurface microbial communities. H2 is produced through Fe2+ oxidation to form magnetite and Fe3+-bearing serpentine. In serpentine, Fe3+ goes into octahedral sites first, then tetrahedral sites [Marcaillou et al., 2011, EPSL]. We use Fe oxidation state and coordination in an Early Ordovician serpentinite in Norbestos, Quebec, as proxies for H2 production and stable isotopes of carbonates to understand past aqueous conditions at the Canadian Space Agency’s 2012 Mars Methane Analogue Mission site.\nRock outcrops were imaged with a visible hyperspectral imager (420-720 nm), and samples were imaged in the laboratory with the same imager and a near infrared imager (650-1100 nm). Other analyses determined major element chemistry (ICP-AES and C analyses), mineralogy (XRD), Fe phases (Mössbauer spectroscopy), and stable isotopes of carbonates.\nFe oxidation state and coordination (tetrahedral vs octahedral) were mapped in samples and outcrops using imaging data. We focused on locations with tetrahedral Fe3+ in serpentine as these are the most serpentinized sites with maximum H2 production. Carbonate samples from ~100-200 m south of a shear zone are enriched in 13C (δ13C up to +16.12‰ vs VPDB) resulting from production of CH4 depleted in 13C in a system closed to C addition but open to CH4 escape. This alteration occurred at elevated temperatures and low water/rock ratios. In the shear zone, lower δ13C values (most < +2‰) positively correlated with δ18O likely result from kinetic fractionation under recent low temperature conditions.\nSpectroscopy suggests that much of this deposit underwent advanced serpentinization to produce significant H2. Isotopic signatures of carbonates precipitated during serpentinization outside the shear zone illuminate the temperatures (elevated) and chemistries of fluids (high Ca2+, low CO2, alkaline) and gases (H2, CH4) in an ancient habitable environment. These results suggest that serpentinites identified on Mars, where there has been limited recent aqueous activity, could preserve evidence of fluid composition and levels of hydrogen production, providing a promising context to search for biosignatures.",

            "abstract": "Abstract\nA case study of return flow over the Gulf of Mexico has been conducted with the intention of determining the value of a single upper-air observation. This case study makes use of a set of upper-air observations collected by the U. S. Coast Guard ship Salvia that followed the trajectory of return-flow air parcels—essentially collecting observations in a Lagrangian frame of reference. A mixed layer model is used to make an ensemble forecast during the outflow phase of the phenomenon—that period when surface-driven buoyancy is the dynamical mechanism that transports moisture and heat into the atmospheric boundary layer. With this low-order nonlinear model, the contributions to forecast uncertainty that stem from initial conditions, boundary conditions, and physical/empirical parameters can be determined separately. These uncertainties serve as input to a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) data assimilation scheme. Results indicate that the uncertainty in initial conditions dominates the full complement of uncertainties. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the value of a single set of upper-air observations over the Gulf (at a point near the onset of return flow). It is clear from this experiment that observations near the initial onset point significantly improves the forecast of mixing ratio and offers hope for improvement in operational forecasting with a modest increase in resources.",

            "abstract": "PlanetVac is a regolith sample acquisition mission concept that uses compressed gas to blow material from the surface up a pneumatic tube and directly into a sample return container. The PlanetVac sampling device is built into the lander legs to eliminate cost and complexity associated with robotic arms and scoops. The pneumatic system can effectively capture fine and coarse regolith, including small pebbles. It is well suited for landed missions to Mars, asteroids, or the Moon. Because of the low pressures on all those bodies, the technique is extremely efficient. If losses are kept to minimum, 1 gram of compressed gas could efficiently lift 6000 grams of soil.\nTo demonstrate this approach, the PlanetVac lander with four legs and two sampling tubes has been designed, integrated, and tested. Vacuum chamber testing was performed using two well-known planetary regolith simulants: Mars Mojave Simulant (MMS) and lunar regolith simulant JSC-1A. One of the two sampling systems was connected to a mockup of an earth return rocket while the second sampling system was connected to a lander deck mounted instrument (clear box for easy viewing). The tests included a drop from a height of approximately 50 cm onto the bed of regolith, deployment of sampling tubes into the regolith, pneumatic acquisition of sample into an instrument (sample container) and the rocket, and the launch of the rocket. The demonstration has been successful and can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjJXvtQk6no. In most of the tests, 20 grams or more of sample was delivered to the 'instrument' and approximately 5 grams of regolith was delivered into a sampling chamber within the rocket. The gas lifting efficiency was calculated to be approximately 1000:1; that is 1 gram of gas lofted 1000 grams of regolith. Efficiencies in lower gravity environments are expected to be much higher.\nThis successful, simple and lightweight sample capture demonstration paves the way to using such sampling system on either NASA or commercial landers to the Moon, Asteroids, comets, or Mars.",

            "abstract": "Andesite magmas at convergent margins are enriched in silica compared to magmas erupting at mid-ocean ridges and intra-plate volcanoes. Determining the cause (s) of silica enrichment is fundamental for models of continental crust formation, arc growth rates and across-arc mass balances (Plank and Langmuir, 1993; Rudnick, 1995; White et al., 2006).The Xi-Ujimqin is located the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt , the CAOB is composed of mainly subduction-accretion complexes, intruded by vast plutons of mainly magmatic arc origin and covered in places by their volcanic derivatives (Sengor et al. 1993; Sengor and Natalin 1996). As the most important site for Phanerozoic crustal growth in the world, the subduction-accretion complexes added ~ 5.3 million km2of material to Asia, half of which may be of juvenile origin (Sengor et al. 1993).The andesitic lavas of Daotenuoer Fms. at Xi-Ujimqin have different trace and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic characteristic from them, these rocks span a SiO2 range of 56.83 ~ 59.17% and MgO of range of 1.21~2.91%, characterized by obviously LREE/HREE fractionation (Ce/YbCN = 11.6 ~ 16.8), strong LILE enrichment and variable Nb-Ta and Sr depletion. They have more radiogenic Sr and less radiogenic Nd and Pb isotopic composition (87Sr/86Sr(i) = 0.7063 ~ 0.7066, eNd(t) = -10.5 ~ -6.3,TDM = 1.22 ~ 1.51Ga, 206Pb / 204Pb(i) = 17.29 ~ 17.33, D7/4 = 3.7 ~ 6.9, D 8/4 = 94 ~ 104) than the contemporaneous intermediate-felsic volcanic lavas. Zircon U-Pb dating results give an emplacement age of ~253 Ma for the these rocks by LA-ICP-MS, corresponding to the Late Permian. The features of major, trace and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope of These rocks imply its sources are of attributes of lower crust North China Carton (NCC) during Paleozoic subduction and collision related to the closure of the Chinese segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean between the NCC and south Mongolia Block (Sengor et al., 1993).",

            "abstract": "Lake Saint-Jean is the third largest natural lake in Québec (Canada), however very few studies have focused on the basin-scale limnogeology of this lake. An initial very high-resolution seismic survey of Lake Saint-Jean was conducted in 2011, providing more than 300 km of seismic sections throughout the lake. These seismic profiles permitted the identification of numerous depositional units at a basin-scale (Nutz et al., Boreas 2014).\nIn this contribution, we focus on prominent large-scale, high-energy sedimentary features that are rather atypical in lakes: a sand-prone sedimentary shelf, sediment drifts and extensive erosional surfaces. All of these features may be attributed to wind-driven hydrodynamics affecting the central portion of the lake, at depths well below the wave base. Coupling the seismic profiles with a series of sediment cores and recent dating results, we now can propose a detailed characterization of these sedimentary features including age and context of emplacement, as well as the dominant depositional processes at work. Indeed, a numerical simulation of wind-induced bottom-current distribution based on realistic wind regimes was also applied in order to validate our previous wind-forcing interpretation.\nThis research provides a more thorough understanding of depositional processes at the origin of fine-grained sediment accumulations in lakes. The prevalence of wind-driven processes in some lacustrine depositional systems is also addressed through the presentation of a conceptual depositional model well-suited for high-energy, wind-driven water-bodies. This model is of interest to all geoscientists dealing with present-day lake systems (e.g., reservoir lake management) as well as researchers working with paleo-lacustrine records and strata (e.g., bottom lake anoxia, hiatial surfaces, hydrocarbon exploration).",

            "abstract": "Thawing of ice-rich permafrost results in irregular, depressed landforms known as thermokarst terrain. The significant subsidence leading to thermokarst features can expand lakes, drain lakes, accelerate thaw, disturb the soil column, and promote erosion. Consequently, it affects many permafrost-region processes including vegetation succession, hydrology, and carbon storage and cycling. Many remote sensing studies identify thermokarst landforms and catalog their ever-changing areas. Yet the intrinsic dynamic thermokarst process, namely surface subsidence, remains a challenge to map and is seldom examined using remote sensing methods.\nInterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique that uses a time-series of satellite SAR images to measure cm-level land surface deformation. We demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of space-borne InSAR data to map thermokarst subsidence at a site located near Prudhoe Bay, on the North Slope of Alaska. A pipeline access road was constructed at this site in the 1970s, and is likely to have triggered the thawing of the region’s permafrost, causing subsequent expansion of thermokarst-landform terrain. Our InSAR analysis using ALOS PALSAR images reveals that the thermokarst landforms in this region have undergone up to 10 cm of surface subsidence each summer from 2007 to 2010. This pilot study demonstrates the application of InSAR to map localized mass movement in permafrost terrain. We also illustrate how the effectiveness and accuracy of InSAR measurements are limited by several factors such as loss of interferometric coherence due to fast changes of ground surface conditions, spatial and temporal resolutions of InSAR data, and difficulty separating long-term and seasonal deformation signals.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of advection fluxes in complex terrain complicates the interpretation of eddy covariance data. As a result, flux monitoring networks are biased towards flat, homogeneous ecosystems. Here, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by efforts to quantify ecosystem mass and energy fluxes in topographically complex sites. An approach for characterizing advection fluxes that relies on data collected from a single tower is described and applied as a case study in a flux monitoring site located in complex and heterogeneous terrain at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (North Carolina, USA). This site experiences significant nocturnal advection of mass and energy driven by downslope drainage flows, and significant daytime horizontal advection driven by the effects of anabatic and katabatic flow regimes on the flux footprint. While the advection regime at Coweeta may be especially challenging, the approach presented here is also relevant for flatter and more homogeneous sites where advection fluxes may be small but nonetheless non-negligible. Having addressed the methodological challenges presented by advection flows, we discuss novel opportunities associated with efforts to monitor ecosystem fluxes in complex sites. In particular, data from Coweeta are leveraged to highlight how topography buffers the site from mesoscale hydro-climatic variability via its influence on precipitation inputs, air and soil temperature, and vapor pressure deficit. We conclude by stressing that advances in flux measurement methodology now permit flux observation campaigns in complex and heterogeneous sites; furthermore, such data may be quite useful for exploring links between terrain, micro-meteorology, and physiological functioning.",

            "abstract": "The steady increase in data quality and the number of global seismographic stations have substantially grown the amount of data available for construction of Earth models. Meanwhile, developments in the theory of wave propagation, numerical methods and HPC systems have enabled unprecedented simulations of seismic wave propagation in realistic 3D Earth models which lead the extraction of more information from data, ultimately culminating in the use of entire three-component seismograms.\nOur aim is to take adjoint tomography further to image the entire planet which is one of the extreme cases in seismology due to its intense computational requirements and vast amount of high-quality seismic data that can potentially be assimilated in inversions. We have started low resolution (T > 27 s, soon will be > 17 s) global inversions with 253 earthquakes for a transversely isotropic crust and mantle model on Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Cray XK7 \"Titan\" system. Recent improvements in our 3D solvers, such as the GPU version of the SPECFEM3D_GLOBE package, will allow us perform higher-resolution (T > 9 s) and longer-duration (~180 m) simulations to take the advantage of high-frequency body waves and major-arc surface waves to improve imbalanced ray coverage as a result of uneven distribution of sources and receivers on the globe. Our initial results after 10 iterations already indicate several prominent features reported in high-resolution continental studies, such as major slabs (Hellenic, Japan, Bismarck, Sandwich, etc.) and enhancement in plume structures (the Pacific superplume, the Hawaii hot spot, etc.). Our ultimate goal is to assimilate seismic data from more than 6,000 earthquakes within the magnitude range 5.5 ≤ Mw ≤ 7.0. To take full advantage of this data set on ORNL’s computational resources, we need a solid framework for managing big data sets during pre-processing (e.g., data requests and quality checks), gradient calculations, and post-processing (e.g., pre-conditioning and smoothing gradients) where we address the bottlenecks in our global seismic workflow based on ORNL’s ADIOS libraries. We will present our “first generation” model, discuss challenges and future directions in global seismology.",

            "abstract": "The physical mechanism responsible for deep earthquakes has been a puzzle since their discovery by Wadati 85 years ago. Today the three most widely accepted mechanisms are dehydration embrittlement (for depths above about 300 km), ‘anticracks’ in metastable olivine (for deeper events), and thermal runaway. Yet, the puzzle remains: no single mechanism seems satisfactory, and having three mechanisms seems contrary to Occams Razor. Where might we look for observations to help resolve this problem?\n One of the 20thcenturies greatest scientific surprises was when seismic data collected during the Apollo projects proved that the Moon was seismically active at depths of 850-1100 km. These deep moonquakes occurred repeatedly within clusters or “nests”, with occurrence times strongly correlated with solid tides. Although they occur under temperature-pressure conditions highly similar to terrestrial earthquakes at depths of ~120 km, it seems unlikely they are caused by dehydration embrittlement, as there is no subduction on the Moon, and possibly little or no water. Must we propose a fourth mechanism for deep quakes? Or are our explanations for terrestrial deep quakes incorrect?\n The development of plate tectonics was one of the 20thcentury science’s great paradigm shifts; one observation it helped explain was why numerous earthquakes with focal depths exceeding 400 km occurred in the mantle in areas like Tonga where very old, fast-moving plates converged. But some “isolated deep earthquakes” are exceptional; these earthquakes occur separated from neighboring events by hundreds of km. Some, like earthquakes in Spain in 1954 and Colombia in 1970, with Mw exceeding 7.5 are among the largest deep-focus earthquakes known, yet occurred singly without any fore- or aftershocks. What physical mechanism allows such large, isolated earthquakes to occur? The tendency is to focus attention on areas like Tonga where the majority of deep events occur. But understanding rare isolated events is equally important if we hope to understand the physical mechanism.\nFigure.

            "abstract": "In the 21st century, the importance of high quality water resources cannot be overstated. New approaches are needed to pinpoint sources and ages of multiple contaminants, and to better understand critical hydrologic systems. Stable isotopic compositions of materials often show strong spatial and temporal distributions related to combinations of sources and processes. Isoscapes (spatial and/or temporal maps) of riverine and atmospheric data are increasingly being found to be effective means for assessing the effects of different land uses and biogeochemical processes on water resources. Hence, isotopes and isoscapes are a potentially powerful component of monitoring and assessment programs that are aimed at quantifying and mitigating alterations to environments from human activities (anthropogenic disturbances). Locations exhibiting unusually high rates of biogeochemical cycling or elevated pollution levels usually have distinctive isotopic compositions that are suggestive or diagnostic of specific reactions and pollution sources. Isotopes can be more effective at identifying hot spots and hot moments than concentrations alone because isotopic ratios may change even when concentrations do not. Hence, isotopes provide valuable additions to standard chemical and hydrological mass balance methods. This presentation will examine how the field of isotope hydrology has evolved over my 40+ year career as an isotope geochemist, highlight several exciting recent research thrusts, and share some thoughts on future research directions.",

            "abstract": "We describe two avenues for constraining the sensitivity of the climate system to external perturbations, using present-day observations. The first is physically motivated, based on recently published work showing that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming. However, this result would be wrong if there were an important feedback in the real world that was missing from all the models.\nThe second approach is based on application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to climate models, to predict the three-dimensional equilibrium response to heating perturbations via a statistical model of the system fitted to data from a control run. We expand on previous applications of this technique for such problems by considering multivariate state vectors, showing that this improves skill and makes it possible to train skillful operators on data records of comparable length to what is available from satellite observations. We also present a new methodology for treating non-stationary processes, in particular the existence of a seasonal cycle, and show that we can obtain similar results with a realistic seasonal cycle as with an idealised non-seasonally-varying case. We focus specifically on the ability to predict how clouds in the model will respond to a forced climate change. Results indicate that the fluctuation-dissipation method may prove to be more useful than previously thought for predicting global forces responses from observed variability, although the skill varies significantly depending on the nature of the forcing perturbation.",

            "abstract": "The records of nitrate concentration and its isotopic composition (δ15N, δ18O and Δ17O) in ice cores are sought to reconstruct past levels of atmospheric NOx, the natural variability in NOx sources, and variations in tropospheric oxidants. However, these practices have been hampered by post-depositional processing of snow nitrate, which alters snow nitrate concentrations as well as its isotopic composition. Snow accumulation rates influence the degree of post-depositional processing. At sites with high snow accumulation rates, such as Summit, Greenland, the degree of post-depositional processing is thought to be minimal. Thus, variations in δ15N(NO3-) in Summit ice cores have been linked to NOx source changes, assuming the conservation of nitrogen isotope signatures during the conversion of NOx to nitrate. However, the marked decrease in δ15N(NO3-) from ~1850 to 1970 observed in Summit ice cores is difficult to explain by the addition of anthropogenic NOx to the natural background, as higher atmospheric δ15N(NO3-) values are frequently observed in polluted regions compared to pristine regions. Alternatively, we hypothesized that this decrease can be explained by changes in atmospheric acidity. Atmospheric acidity influences the partitioning of nitrate in gas- and aerosol-phases, inducing isotopic effects. Increased atmospheric acidity beginning ~ 1850 arising from anthropogenic SO2 emissions leads to elevated gas-phase HNO3 which is depleted in δ15N relative to aerosol nitrate. The preferential transport of HNO3 to the Arctic then leads to a decrease in ice core δ15N(NO3-). This hypothesis is supported by the significant correlation between δ15N(NO3-) and acidity records, and is supported by a model simulation. The result of this study indicates the importance of atmospheric processes to ice core δ15N(NO3-), and suggests that the link between ice core δ15N(NO3-) and NOx sources could be problematic even at high snow accumulation sites. In addition, our δ15N(NO3-) measurements in Summit ice cores expanding to the glacial-interglacial timescale indicate clear evidence of the effects of post-depositional processing, making it even more difficult to link ice core δ15N(NO3-) variations to NOx source changes.",

            "abstract": "The transition to a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean has attracted much attention, but climate model simulations in CMIP5 vary widely in their prediction of when we will reach a summer ice-free state. To quantify the contribution of internal variability to the spread of projections and to assess the limit of predictability of the year we will reach a summer ice-free Arctic we will present results from the new Large Ensemble with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The CESM is a state of the art climate system model that has shown skill in capturing the observed decline of Arctic sea ice. The CESM Large Ensemble has 30 members for 1920-2100 that only differ through round-of level perturbations in the initial state. It is an unprecedented opportunity to analyze the contribution of natural variability to the simulated climate evolution within one model, as it provides enough ensemble members to characterize the probability distribution of many climate phenomena. Focusing on Arctic sea ice predictability, we find that the individual ensemble members first reach an ice-free Arctic in September (defined as a sea ice extent of 1 million km2) over a period of 21 years (2032-2053), with the majority of the ensemble members first reaching September ice-free conditions in the 5-year period from 2040-2044. This large spread shows the large impact of internal variability on the timing of reaching an ice-free Arctic, which severely limits the predictability of a summer ice-free Arctic we can expect from CMIP-type climate models. In addition to results on the predictability of an ice-free Arctic, we will also present results on the probability of hiatus periods in sea ice loss and of rapid ice loss events (RILEs), based on the CESM large ensemble.",

            "abstract": "The long-lived ocean quahog, Arctica islandica, is a fairly well developed and tested marine proxy archive, however, the utility of elemental ratios in A. islandica shell material as environmental proxies remains questionable. To further evaluate the influence of seawater temperature on elemental and isotopic incorporation during biomineralization, A. islandica shells were grown at constant temperatures under two regimes during a 16-week period from March 27 to July 21, 2011. Seawater from the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, Maine was pumped into temperature and flow controlled tanks that were exposed to ambient food and salinity conditions. A total of 20 individual juvenile clams with an average shell height of 36 mm were stained with calcein (a commonly used biomarker) and cultured at 10.3 ± 0.3 °C for six weeks. After this, shell heights were measured and the clams were again stained with calcein and cultured at 15.0 ± 0.4 °C for an additional 9.5 weeks. The average shell growth during the first phase of the experiment was 2.4 mm with a linear extension rate of 0.40 mm/week. The average shell growth during the second phase of the experiment was 3.2 mm with an extension rate of 0.34 mm/week. Average salinity values were 30.2 ± 0.7 and 30.7 ±0.7 in the first and second phases of the experiment, respectively. Oxygen isotopes from the cultured seawater were collected throughout the experiment and provide the basis for establishing if shells grew in oxygen isotopic equilibrium. Elemental ratios (primarily Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) in the aragonitic shells were determined via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), while stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios were measured using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Continuous sampling within and across the temperature conditions (from 10 °C to 15 °C) coupled with the calcein markings provides the ability to place each sample into a precise temporal framework. The results from these culture experiments will provide insight on biomineralization processes in A. islandica and further establish the utility of this archive in environmental studies.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic models of supercontinent assembly and dispersal should strive to emulate kinematic histories obtained from the geologic record; but the breakup of Pangea and initial assembly of Amasia, at 200-0 Ma, are the only phases of an alleged \"cycle\" that are known with good precision. Pre-Mesozoic reconstructions (i.e., 95% of Earth history) must rely on typically non-unique geological comparisons between extant continental fragments, guided by sparse paleomagnetic data from those blocks. Pangea assembly and evolution (500-200 Ma) are known in broad terms, but uncertainties of order 10-20° arc distance are common. The transition from Rodinia breakup to incipient Pangea assembly (Gondwana amalgamation; 700-500 Ma) is the least understood interval of global kinematics from the past two billion years, with uncertainties occasionally nearing 90°, and raising the geophysical specters of non-dipole geomagnetic field geometries and/or rapid true polar wander oscillations. Various Rodinia reconstructions (900-700 Ma) share many common features, but they are upheld by a rather lean dataset, by comparison to Pangea. The assembly stage of Rodinia (1300-900 Ma) derives its substantial uncertainty from questions concerning not only the supercontinent's end-configuration as noted above, but also the reconstruction of its predecessor Nuna (1600-1300 Ma), which has made much recent progress though likewise based on relatively limited data. Nuna's assembly phase (2000-1600 Ma) is a fruitful frontier for global reconstruction hypotheses at their earliest stages of development. Older intervals (2700-2000 Ma) will likely soon yield some insights into whether an earlier possible supercontinent, Kenorland, may have existed; but gaining even a broad outline of its reconstruction will be hard-fought, probably over decades, against dwindling Archean preservation. Today's geodynamic modelers of supercontinental episodicity should consider these noteworthy uncertainties as they assess whether their models are \"Earth-like.\" Explorations into neglected corners of parameter space may shed light not only onto possible dynamic evolutions of exoplanets, but perhaps also to our own planet in deep time.",

Basalt-hosted hydrothermal sites exhibit characteristic responses with magnetic lows and minima of the gravity field. Near bottom AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) based potential field surveys have become a very effective technique in deep sea exploration. Here we present results of recent ship-borne and near seafloor magnetic and gravity investigations at deep (Marsili and Palinuro seamounts) and shallow (Panarea, Basiluzzo and Secca del Capo) hydrothermal sites in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea including multibeam bathymetry, seafloor reflectivity and seismic profiles.\nAt Marsili seamount, a large Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides-rich chimney field is located at the summit (500 m depth). This site is correlated with pronounced magnetic and gravity lows (0 A/m and 2.0 g/cm3). Deep tow magnetic survey (Cruise MAVA11) revealed strong association between the complicated magnetization pattern and the main volcano-tectonic features of the ridge.\nHydrothermal manifestations at Palinuro seamount occur mainly on the western sector within the rim of a caldera structure at depth of 600m. Recent AUV based magnetic surveys (Cruise POS442, 2012 using AUV “Abyss”) detailed a magnetization low interpreted to represent the local distribution of subseafloor hydrothermal alteration (potentially massive sulfide deposits), and also mapped previously undiscovered inactive chimney fields.\nHydrothermal sites observed at the arc-related volcanic islands (Panarea, Basiluzzo, Eolo and Secca del Capo) are confined to shallow depths (less then 300m) and associated with large ochreaceous mounds, vents and chimney fields such as those observed E of Basiluzzo Island. At this site a recent magnetic survey (Cruise PANA13_ASTREA) combined with Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) investigations revealed that the submarine geothermal field of Panarea island is actually extending in NE-SW direction along preferential tectonic trends which intercept the submerged portion of Basiluzzo. These new findings could help the volcanic hazard mitigation of Panarea archipelago in case of a new gas crisis similar that which occurred in 2002.",

Progress on this hypothesis, however, has been hindered by a limited knowledge of the variability of the fjord waters in proximity to the glaciers, and a limited understanding of how such variability may affect submarine melt rates. Here, we present a synthesis of 5 years of oceanic data collected in the vicinity of Helheim Glacier, East Greenland, including the fjord and the nearby continental shelf from moored instrumentation. A comparison of this variability to that of the nearby, larger scale subpolar gyre, obtained from Argo float data, reveal that much of the seasonal and interannual variability observed in the fjord can be attributed to changes in the large scale ocean. The observed fjord variability, in conjunction with the regional atmospheric forcing, is then used to reconstruct changes in submarine melt rates. These, in turn, are compared with observed changes in the characteristics of Helheim Glacier in order to investigate the extent to which submarine melting may be driving glacier variability.",

In this study we refine the range of possible IBEX flow parameters based on the latest measurements and show that both spacecraft’s data could be consistent with a single flow velocity for a much larger interstellar neutral temperature (7000-9000K) than previously found. Combining the IBEX and Ulysses observations suggests that the heliosphere is currently in a substantially warmer region of the interstellar medium than previously thought.

Heat conduction transports energy from the warmer, higher layers of the thermosphere to lower layers where CO2 and NO ultimately radiate the energy. These radiative processes play a large role in governing the neutral temperature of the ionosphere E and F regions. The SABER instrument on the NASA TIMED satellite has been observing radiative cooling by NO and CO2 for 13 years. Substantial variability in the radiative cooling is observed on timescales ranging from one day to the 11-year solar cycle. Harmonics of the annual cycle are evident in the CO2 cooling rates, implying strong coupling to the lower atmosphere. Harmonics of the solar rotation period are evident in the NO cooling, but only during solar minimum conditions. To date the NO cooling data have been helpful in understanding space weather forecasts and the interaction of co-rotating interaction regions with the ionosphere. The cooling rate data will be reviewed in light of their observed variability over the past 13 years, including the implications for variations in the thermal structure of the E and F regions. The potential for development of proxies and empirical models of the NO and CO2 emissions will also be presented. Such models could become part of an overall space weather forecasting tool.",

            "abstract": "Aseismic fault slip was first reported over forty years ago along some major strike slip faults including the San Andreas (SAF) and North Anatolian faults (NAF). Yet both their origin and timing on active faults and underlying physical processes remain subjects of debate. The presence of weak minerals and/or trapped fluid overpressures within fault zones have been proposed as mechanics for aseismic fault creep. Our InSAR observations together with GPS measurements and geology along the NAF provide new evidence for the mechanism, characteristics, and initiation of fault surface creep. We have used the persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique to investigate both the creeping section of the NAF at Ismetpaşa that had ruptured during the 1944 and 1951 earthquakes, and the postseismic era of the 1999 İzmit Earthquake. The results reveal that the central segment of the 1999 Izmit Earthquake rupture has been creeping for over for the past 15 years since the event, becoming the longest lasting afterslip ever recorded. The slip pattern of ongoing surface creep on the İzmit rupture supports the idea that stable fault creep can be initiated as postseismic afterslip, a mechanism we proposed previously but could not have confirmed due to the lack of pre- and post-earthquake observations on creeping faults such as the Ismetpaşa segment of the NAF and the segments of the SAF in the San Francisco Bay area. Geological maps along the Ismetpaşa and Izmit creeping segments show that both fault zones run through ophiolitic and calcareous rocks with phyllosilicates that probably result in fault weakening. Earthquake rupture maps and PS-InSAR velocity fields for these regions also reveal that the creeping faults have simple geometry being fairly rectilinear and continuous along their strike. These common features suggest that following a large earthquake, a stable surface creep can be triggered on a section of a mature fault if it has evolved in to simple geometry and is located within weak rocks.",

At the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO), we use a combination of high resolution, LiDAR-derived digital topography and the cosmogenic radionuclide meteoric 10Be to measure rates of regolith transport along six hillslopes (3 north-facing, 3 south-facing), test commonly invoked transport rules, and elucidate the mechanisms acting to transport regolith materials. Topographic observations reveal a systematic asymmetry at SSHO, where north-facing hillslopes exhibit steeper gradients than south-facing hillslopes. Despite this asymmetry, our meteoric 10Be results suggest that regolith flux is similar along all six hillslopes, and that the landscape is steadily lowering at ~ 20-30 m/My. Tests of frequently invoked transport rules suggest that downslope regolith transport is depth-dependent at SSHO, and that regolith transport efficiency is consistently higher on south-facing hillslopes than north-facing hillslopes by a factor of two. However, along ridgetops, where regolith thickness is uniformly thin, our results suggest that aspect-related differences in transport efficiency are minimal and ridgetop curvature reflects erosion rate and transport efficiency. Therefore, we contend that hillslopes at SSHO are approaching an equilibrium condition, where ridgetop curvature and hillslope gradient are adjusted to maintain a steady flux of materials out of the watershed.",

            "abstract": "Many landforms display sharp corners, or edges, that are maintained as they migrate laterally. Our present landscape models, cast largely in terms of patterns of vertical erosion, fail to capture the essence of these landscapes, including flatirons, hogbacks, cliffs, and lumpy outcropped hillslopes; roche moutonée and glacial steps, and river knickpoints. Yet these are the very landscape signatures of rock type and structure. Block sizes, and the fracture distributions that bound the blocks, vary from one rock type or geological setting to another. Removal and transportation of discrete blocks of rock maintains a sharp edge, and results in their upvalley/upslope migration.\nOur challenge in developing numerical landscapes is to capture the essential variation, noisiness, and roughness of natural landscapes and their dependence on rock type and structure. The rate of lowering of the landscape is governed by the product of the spatial density of edges, their step height, and their rate of migration. I present cellular automata-like models in which I explicitly incorporate blocks, and utilize algorithms for the susceptibility of any block to motion, and the forces imposed on the surface by the environment. Susceptibility of a block to release is governed by its size, the geometry of the pocket in which it sits, the frictional properties of the bounding discontinuities, and the cohesion across these discontinuities. This is akin to coordination number and bond strengths of atoms in mineral dissolution studies; their atoms are our blocks. Removal of a block requires an event of sufficient magnitude to overcome its resistance. The relevant events include fluctuations in water pressure at the bed of glaciers, turbulence and sediment impacts in rivers, and root throw or earthquakes in hillslopes.\nPreliminary models capture the essence of migrating edges. The systems self-organize to produce suites of steps. In glacial beds, for example, migration of steps produces upvalley and downward migrating rocky edges with an angle of descent analogous to the angle of climb of migrating bedforms; this angle reflects the relative importance of abrasion and quarrying. Steps in glacial beds arise from strong gradients in fracture density because the susceptibility to quarrying is strongly governed by block size.",

            "abstract": "Glacial Lake Calgary in southern Alberta, Canada, was a Late Pleistocene proglacial lake that formed along the southwest margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS), dammed by the retreating ice sheet margin. Attempts to constrain the age of the lake using radiocarbon methods have been hampered by the lack of datable organic material. In an effort to apply an alternative chronometer, this study uses two optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating approaches to date fine grained sand and silt that were deposited in the lake during its existence. OSL dating determines the depositional ages of sediments by measuring the energy from ionizing radiation that is stored in mineral grains such as quartz and feldspar. Dividing the stored energy, also referred to as the paleodose, by the rate at which the dose accumulated, allows an age to be ascertained. In one method applied in this study, the paleodose stored in the feldspar component of the sediment is determined using normalized infrared stimulated luminescence signals acquired using a portable OSL reader. In the second method, blue optically stimulated luminescence signals obtained from quartz separates from the sediment by employing a regular OSL reader and standard protocols are used to determine the paleodose. After correcting the feldspar data for anomalous fading, the age results from the two dating approaches are compared. The ages signify a time period by which the LIS had retreated from the study area and, hence, serve as constraints for the initiation of the retreat of the ice sheet from its western limit. Advantages and limitations of the dating methods are briefly discussed.\nConstraining the chronology of the retreat of the LIS from western Canada allows for a better understanding of the driving forces behind ice sheet retreat. Secondly, assigning a temporal scale to the postglacial evolution of the environment of the region permits a better insight into the dynamics of the physical and biological environments of the time. Thirdly, the region is at the heart of the ice-free corridor that was ostensibly used by early humans to migrate southwards to populate the Americas ca. 16 ka ago. Hence, an improved deglaciation chronology would allow a more comprehensive evaluation of this concept.",

In Czechia, there are two mountain ranges (Krkonoše and Jeseníky Mountains), which suffer from regular avalanche activity every year. Mountain Rescue Service is responsible for issuing avalanche bulletins. However, its approaches are still lacking objective assessments and procedures for hazard level estimations. This lack is mainly caused by missing expert avalanche information system.\nThis paper presents preliminary results from a project funded by the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic. This project is focused on development of an information system for snow-avalanche hazard level forecasting. It is composed of three main modules, which should act as a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Mountain Rescue Service.\nFirstly, snow-avalanche susceptibility model is used for delimiting areas where avalanches can occur based on accurate statistical analyses. For that purpose a waste database is used, containing more than 1100 avalanche events from 1961/62 till present.\nSecondly, a physical modeling of the avalanches is being performed on avalanche paths using RAMMS modeling code. Regular paths, where avalanches occur every year, and irregular paths are being assessed. Their footprint is being updated using return period information for each path.\nThirdly, snow distribution and stability models (distributed HBV-ETH, Snowtran 3D, Snowpack and Alpine 3D) are used to assess the critical conditions for avalanche release. For calibration of the models data about meteo/snow cover data and snowpits is used.\nThose three parts are being coupled in a WebGIS platform used as the principal component of the DSS in snow-avalanche hazard level assessment.",

            "abstract": "Natural faults are surrounded by materials damaged through quasi-static and dynamic processes, forming fault zones whose thickness and degree of damage may vary along strike and depth, and as a function of fault maturity. Fault zones can affect earthquake ruptures in observable ways. In particular, we have found that waves trapped in tabular fault zones with reduced seismic wave velocities can generate pulse-like rupture and oscillatory rupture speed, facilitate supershear rupture transition and allow for steady rupture propagation at speeds that are unstable or inadmissible in homogeneous media. Fault zones also enhance near-field ground motions. These effects can appear in pre-existing fault zones but also in damaged zones generated dynamically during rupture, and crucially depend on the fault zone thickness and velocity reduction. Here we attempt to understand what controls fault zone thickness.\nA synthesis of field observations indicates a dependence of fault zone thickness on cumulated slip characterized by linear scaling at small slip and saturation at large slip. These observations combined with empirical slip-length relations suggest that the maximum fault zone thickness is controlled by (proportional to) the depth extent of the seismogenic zone. We will present fracture mechanics theoretical arguments and dynamic rupture simulations with off-fault plasticity and damage that predict this saturation of fault zone thickness. In essence, the stress intensity factor at the front of a rupture in 3D, which controls the distance reached by the large off-fault stresses that cause damage, scales with the shortest characteristic length of the slipping zone. This length is limited by the seismogenic depth.\nFurther implications and effects of seismogenic depth will be presented, including limits on the fault stepover offset that can be breached by a dynamic rupture.",

            "abstract": "The Snowball Earth model provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding the causes and demise of the extreme global glaciations that occurred during the Neoproterozoic, and can be refined through creative interactions between geological, geochemical and modeling studies. We present unequivocal evidence for oscillating glacier extent and varying hydrological conditions during the Marinoan, the second major Cryogenian glaciation (~650-635 Ma), from the Wilsonbreen Formation of NE Svalbard. Extensive exposures record (1) a possibly long arid periglacial phase; (2) multiple switches between subglacial, glaciolacustrine, carbonate lacustrine and non-glacial terrestrial deposition; and (3) rapid deglaciation. Oxygen and sulfur isotopes of sulfate in carbonate facies indicate persistently high pCO2 consistent with deposition of the Formation on a 105-year timescale.\nUsing an ice sheet model (GRISLI) coupled to a General Circulation Model (LMDz), the response of the continental ice-sheet to insolation changes (i.e. orbital forcing) and pCO2 is investigated. We show that land-ice cover waxes and wanes over the course of a precession cycle for pCO2 levels from 0.01 to 0.05 bar. Growth and retreat of ice reflect shifts in the balance between precipitation and evaporation (P-E), in response to migration of the tropical Hadley Cell. In cold conditions (<0.01bar), the weakness of the hydrological cycle makes the system insensitive to precession changes, explaining relatively stable ice-sheets during the earlier stages of the Snowball Earth. With 0.01<pCO2<0.05bar, variations of the P-E pattern caused by insolation changes (orbital forcing) produces advances/retreats of the ice sheet in <10 kyr. With pCO2>0.05bar, the albedo effect is overcome and air temperatures rise in ice free regions in low latitudes and deglaciation occurs. The results show that the Snowball Earth model can be reconciled with evidence for prolonged, pulsed glacial deposition. The main, longest phase of the glacial epoch appears to have been cold and arid with a limited hydrological cycle, but deglaciation was not a simple switch from icehouse to greenhouse. Instead, there was a climate transition during which glacial cycles could be forced by Milankovitch orbital variations.",

The ice phase in cloud remains enigmatic because ice crystal number concentrations can exceed the number concentrations of those aerosol particles acting as centers for ice crystals (so-called ice nuclei) by orders of magnitude. To date, measurement devices for ice nuclei are rare and custom-made. In this work, I present the significant progress that has been made in the ice nucleation community in identifying which aerosol particles may act as ice nuclei and why. As pointed out in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions remains the largest uncertainty of the anthropogenic forcings. On the other hand, how clouds change in a warmer climate is the largest of uncertainties in terms of the expected warming at a point of doubling of carbon dioxide.",

            "abstract": "The ion foreshock upstream of the quasi-parallel terrestrial bow shock is characterized by suprathermal plasma counter-streaming against the incident solar wind. Interactions between the foreshock and solar wind plasmas can enhance wave activity and produce large-scale transient phenomena, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs) and foreshock bubbles (FBs). HFAs and FBs both result from discontinuities in the interplanetary magnetic field “sweeping up” and concentrating suprathermal foreshock ions via gyro-kinetic effects. These concentrations become the super-heated cores of HFAs and FBs and result in strong disruptions of the local solar wind plasma, including flow deflections and strong density and magnetic field variations. One of the consequences of these strong variations is a change in the total pressure incident on the bow shock. Here, we quantify these pressure variations from a series of cases of HFAs and FBs observed by NASA’s THEMIS spacecraft and discuss how these pressure variations can penetrate through the magnetosheath and impact the magnetosphere, resulting in significant magnetopause displacement. With evidence from multi-point observations, we also compare and contrast the nature of HFAs and FB impacts on the magnetopause, showing that HFAs tend to be more localized in nature while FBs impact the system more globally, similar to pressure pulses in the solar wind. Both phenomena also result in the formation of strong compressions and/or shocks, resulting in strong wave activity. We finish with a discussion of the potential for particle acceleration from HFAs and FBs, showing evidence that both are highly efficient at ion and electron acceleration.",

            "abstract": "It is notoriously difficult to create and maintain permeability in deep hot-dry rock (HDR) geothermal reservoirs with engineering strategies. However, we predict that long-lived, slowly deforming HDR reservoirs likely contain hydraulically conductive, over-pressured fracture systems, provided that (a) the underlying lower crust and/or mantle are not entirely depleted of fluids and (b) the fracture system has not been drained into highly permeable overlying rocks. Such fracture systems could be targeted for the extraction of geothermal energy.\nOur prediction hinges on the notion that polycrystalline creep through matter transfer by a liquid phase (dissolution-precipitation creep) is a widespread mechanism for extracting fluids from the lower crust and mantle. Such processes - where creep cavities form during the slow, high-temperature deformation of crystalline solids, e.g., ceramics, metals, and rocks – entail the formation of (intergranular) fluid-assisted creep fractures. They constitute micron-scale voids formed along grain boundaries due to incompatibilities arising from diffusion or dislocation creep. Field and laboratory evidence suggest that the process leading to creep fractures may generate a dynamic permeability in the ductile crust, thus extracting fluids from this domain.\nWe employed an elasto-visco-plastic material model that simulates creep fractures with continuum damage mechanics to model the slow contraction of high-heat-producing granites overlain by sedimentary rocks in 2D. The models suggest that deformation always leads to the initiation of a horizontal creep-damage front in the lower crust. This front propagates upwards towards the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) during protracted deformation where it collapses into highly damaged brittle-ductile shear zones. If the BDT is sufficiently shallow or finite strain sufficiently large, these shear zones trigger brittle faults emerging from their tips, which connect to the sub-horizontal damage layer just underneath the BDT. This layer may feed the brittle fault with over-pressured, hot fluids from ductile lithosphere. We discuss our models in relation to the Cooper-Basin granites of South Australia, which may constitute a natural example of this phenomenon.",

Here we demonstrate that a small cluster of tremors is extremely well correlated with tide levels observed at nearby stations in western Japan. The correlation is interpreted as representing a nonlinear relationship between stress and slip, which is similar to the rate-dependent friction law. An empirical relationship and observed tide records explain the temporal changes in tremor activity over 9 years. The combination of the nonlinear fault rheology and oscillating tidal stress may control temporal changes in plate motion and earthquake occurrence. Remarkably, the background seismicity is similar to the predicted tremor rate obtained from tidal observations over the past 50 years. This mechanism may also explain the seasonality and decadal-scale weak periodicity of large earthquakes and is likely to be helpful in probabilistic forecasting of future seismicity.",

            "abstract": "The formerly glaciated granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley are now primarily modified by rockfalls, and vast accumulations of talus beneath the cliffs indicate the long-term importance of this process. Formation and weathering of exfoliation fractures provides a mechanism for relatively steady cliff erosion over thousand-year timescales, but how important are larger events? Yosemite Valley presents an ideal setting for investigating postglacial cliff erosion because (1) Last Glacial Maximum deglaciation left a wide, flat valley floor that has experienced only a few meters of subsequent aggradation, (2) deglaciation is known to have occurred ~15 ka, (3) lidar-based digital elevation models reveal postglacial talus accumulations in three dimensions, (4) talus deposits have been precisely dated by Be-10, and (5) historical rockfalls are well documented. Since deglaciation, ~180 million m3 of rock has been shed from 53 million m2 of cliffs, representing a postglacial cliff retreat rate of ~0.2 mm/yr – among the faster landscape erosion rates measured in the Sierra Nevada. The average annual talus accumulation rate over the past 15 kyr is about 12,000 m3/yr, but evidence suggests that accumulation rates were punctuated by infrequent, extremely large events. Ten extremely large rockfalls, dated by Be-10, occurred between 13.2 and 1.0 ka and were likely seismically triggered. Volumetrically, these events represent about one-fifth of the total postglacial talus volume. Historical talus accumulations are similarly punctuated. A database of historical rockfalls documents ~1.55 million m3 of rock that has fallen from the valley walls since 1857, yielding a historical cliff retreat rate of ~0.2 mm/yr and an average annual accumulation rate of about 10,000 m3/yr, similar to rates averaged over 15 kyr. However, here again talus accumulation is dominated by a few extremely large (≥200,000 m3) events; a single 600,000 m3 rockfall in 1987 accounts for nearly one-third of the total historical volume. Thus, both long- and short-term rockfall records in Yosemite Valley indicate that, although formation and degradation of exfoliation fractures may allow for relatively steady cliff erosion, volumetrically this process is equaled or even exceeded by infrequent, extremely large rockfalls.",

Seismic tomography has been an important tool for the determination of three-dimensional (3-D) velocity structure. However, attenuation inversion has generally fallen behind velocity studies mainly because of the data scattering, inversion complexity and interpretation difficulty. Here, I combine the recent results of attenuation tomography with the existing velocity models for the interpretation of structural heterogeneity in both northern and southern California. I focus the attenuation study on frequency-independent 3-D compressional wave attenuation model (indicated by the reciprocal of quality factor Qp) for the crust and uppermost mantle in the study areas. The classic simul2000 tomographic algorithm is applied to invert the frequency-independent attenuation operator t* values measured from amplitude spectra of P-wave arrivals through recently developed 3-D velocity models and earthquake relocation catalogs. In general, the resulting Qp values increase with depth and agree with the surface geology at shallow depth layers. I also apply a state-of-the-art technique to estimate in situ Vp/Vs ratios for similar event clusters by using P- and S-wave differential times from waveform cross-correlation. This approach provides highly precise results for near-source regions because cross-correlation can measure differential times to within a few milliseconds and can achieve a precision of 0.001 in the estimated Vp/Vs ratio, corresponding to about 0.0004 in Poisson’s ratio. The availability of 3-D attenuation models and in situ Vp/Vs ratios provides a complementary definition of the fault systems in California to the existing velocity models.",

Limitations of this approach are related to the quality and resolution of remote sensing data and the representation of subsurface flow in the land surface model, amongst others. This presentation focuses on ways to improve predictions with land surface models using sequential data assimilation. One approach is multivariate data assimilation, where different data types are jointly assimilated. We will show two examples; one is the joint assimilation of land surface temperature and brightness temperature, the second example is the joint assimilation of neutron counts and land surface temperature. A second approach to improve predictions is estimation of land surface parameters in a consistent stochastic framework. This will be illustrated with a synthetic example. A third approach is by using a more sophisticated land surface model. A sequential data assimilation framework implemented together with the land surface model ParFlow-CLM in a high performance computing environment will be presented, and its performance illustrated for a real-world example.",

Although no large changes were apparent in the total freshwater inventory, a decline in the inventory of meteoric water (-600 km3 yr-1) between 2000 and 2012 was somewhat offset by a concomitant increase in the net sea-ice meltwater (300 km3 yr-1) contribution to the total freshwater volume of the North Pole region. In more recent years (2013-2014), both meteoric water and sea-ice melt contributions have reverted back toward values reminiscent of the late 1990s/early 2000s.\nThe loss of meteoric water from the Central Arctic generally agreed with hypotheses that suggest the recent freshwater increase observed in Canada Basin was due, in part, to a diversion of Siberian river runoff from the Central to Western Arctic. In contrast, the average annual increase in net sea-ice melt was approximately equal to the long-term decline in the sea ice volume anomaly. Although no trend was apparent in the Pacific water influence, two separate events resulted in relatively brief (1-3 years) returns of Pacific water to the Central Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The two large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that dominate lower-mantle structure may hold key information on Earth's thermal and chemical evolution. It is generally accepted that these provinces are hotter than background mantle and are likely the main source of mantle plumes. Increasingly, it is also proposed that they hold a dense (primitive and/or recycled) compositional component. The principle evidence that LLSVPs may represent thermo-chemical `piles' comes from seismic constraints, including: (i) their long-wavelength nature; (ii) sharp gradients in shear-wave velocity at their margins; (iii) non-Gaussian distributions of deep mantle shear-wave velocity anomalies; (iv) anti-correlated shear-wave and bulk-sound velocity anomalies (and elevated ratios between shear- and compressional-wave velocity anomalies); (v) anti-correlated shear-wave and density anomalies; and (vi) 1-D/radial profiles of seismic velocity that deviate from those expected for an isochemical, well-mixed mantle. In addition, it has been proposed that hotspots and the reconstructed eruption sites of large igneous provinces correlate in location with LLSVP margins. Here, we review recent results, which indicate that the majority of these constraints do not require thermo-chemical piles: they are equally well (or poorly) explained by thermal heterogeneity alone. Our analyses and conclusions are largely based on comparisons between imaged seismic structure and synthetic seismic structures from a set of thermal and thermo-chemical mantle convection models, which are constrained by 300 Myr of plate motion histories. Modelled physical structure (temperature, pressure and composition) is converted into seismic velocities via a thermodynamic approach that accounts for elastic, anelastic and phase contributions and, subsequently, a tomographic resolution filter is applied to account for the damping and geographic bias inherent to seismic imaging. Our results indicate that, in terms of large-scale seismic structure and dynamics, these two provinces are predominantly thermal features and, accordingly, that chemical heterogeneity is largely a passive component of lowermost mantle dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Roots play a key role in the soil water balance. They extract and transport water for transpiration, which usually represents the most important soil water loss in vegetated areas, and can redistribute soil water, thereby increasing transpiration rates and enhancing root nutrient uptake.\nWe present here a two-dimensional model capable of describing two key aspects of root water uptake: root water compensation and hydraulic redistribution. Root water compensation is the ability of root systems to respond to the reduction of water uptake from areas of the soil with low soil water potential by increasing the water uptake from the roots in soil parts with higher water potential. Hydraulic redistribution is a passive transfer of water through the root system from areas of the soil with greater water potential to areas with lower water potential. Both mechanisms are driven by gradients of water potential in the soil and the roots.\nThe inclusion of root water compensation and hydraulic redistribution in models can be achieved by describing root water uptake as a function of the difference in water potential between soil and root xylem. We use a model comprising the Richards equation for the water flow in variably saturated soils and the Darcy’s equation for the water flow in the xylem. The two equations are coupled via a sink term, which is assumed to be proportional to the difference between soil and xylem water potentials.\nThe model is applied in two case studies to describe vertical and horizontal hydraulic redistribution and the interaction between vegetation with different root depths. In the case of horizontal redistribution, the model is used to reproduce the fluxes of water across the root system of a tree subjected to uneven irrigation. This example can be extended to situations when only part of the root system has access to water, such as vegetation near creeks, trees at the edge of forests, and street trees in urban areas. The second case is inspired by recent agro-ecosystems experiments that combined different vegetation species to increase crop yield. The presence of deep rooted plants (nursing species) near shallow rooted crops (nursed species) enhanced crop growth thanks to vertical and horizontal hydraulic redistribution. The model is able to reproduce the patterns of water redistribution observed in this scenario.",

Methane monitoring at high latitude wetlands have been carried out since the 1970s, and at this time there are published data from a large number of sites and some individual sites have data that span more than a decade. By synthesizing data both across and within sites it is possible to improve our understanding of environmental and physical controls on methane emissions. It is clear from comparing mean growing season methane emissions across sites that site wetness, soil temperature and vegetation composition have strong and interacting effects. At individual sites it is also evident that soil temperatures and wetness co-vary at inter-annual scales as a result of physical processes, with compounding influences on methane emissions. Further the presence of certain sedge species, often found in fens at high latitudes strongly influence sensitivities to soil temperature and wetness. Shifts in functional relationships as related to ecosystem structure is central for methane emissions at high latitude wetlands, given the hydrological and ecological changes that occur with permafrost thaw and thermokarst landform development. Hence, in order to more accurately project future methane emissions from high latitudes at a pan-arctic scale, it is necessary to include a spatial representation of thermokarst development as well as ecosystem-appropriate functional relationships between emissions and environmental variables.",

We studied patterns of in situ gene expression and co-registered geochemistry in order to 1) describe the diversity and physiological poise of active microbial communities that span thermal and geochemical gradients from active diffuse flow to background vent field seawater, and 2) determine to what extent seawater or subsurface microbes were active throughout this environment. Analyses of multiple metatranscriptomes from 5 geochemically distinct sites (some from samples preserved in situ) show that proximate diffuse flows showed strikingly different transcription profiles. Specifically, caldera background and some diffuse flows were similar, both dominated by seawater-derived Gammaproteobacteria despite having distinct geochemistries. Intra-field community shows evidence of increased primary productivity throughout the entire vent field and not just at individual diffuse flows. In contrast, a more spatially limited, Epsilonproteobacteria-dominated transcription profile from the most hydrothermally-influenced diffuse flow appeared to be driven by the activity of vent-endemic microbes, likely reflecting subsurface microbial activity. We suggest that the microbial activity within many diffuse flow vents is primarily attributable to seawater derived Gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers, while in certain other flows vent-endemic Epsilonproteobactiera are most active. These data reveal a diversity in microbial activity at diffuse flows that has not previously been recognized, and reshapes our thinking about the relative influence that different microbial communities may have on local processes (such as primary production) and potentially global biogeochemical cycles.",

To assess the limitations of global water resources, numerous indicators have been developed, but they rarely consider nonrenewable water use. In addition, surface water over-abstraction is rarely assessed in the context of human and environmental water needs. Here, we perform a transient assessment of global groundwater and surface water use over the historical period 1960-2010 as well as the future projections of 2011-2099, using a newly developed indicator: the Blue Water Sustainability Index (BlWSI). The BlWSI incorporates both nonrenewable groundwater use and nonsustainable water use that compromises environmental flow requirements. Our results reveal an increasing trend of water consumed from nonsustainable surface water and groundwater resources over the historical period (~30%), and this increase is projected to continue further towards the end of this century (~40%). The global amount of nonsustainable water consumption has been increasing especially since the late 1990s, despite a wetter climate and increasing water availability during this period. The BlWSI is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the renewability and degradation of surface water and groundwater resources as a result of human water over-abstraction.",

            "abstract": "Freeze-thaw is an abiotic stress applied to soils and is a natural process at medium to high latitudes. Freezing and thawing processes influence not only the physical properties of soil, but also the metabolic activity of soil microorganisms. Fungi and bacteria play a crucial role in soil organic matter degradation and the production of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2, CH4 and N2O. Production and consumption of these atmospheric trace gases are the result of biological processes such as photosynthesis, aerobic respiration (CO2), methanogenesis, methanotrophy (CH4), nitrification and denitrification (N2O). To enhance our understanding of the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil biogeochemical transformations and fluxes, a highly instrumented soil column experiment was designed to realistically simulate freeze-thaw dynamics under controlled conditions. Pore waters collected periodically from different depths of the column and solid-phase analyses on core material obtained at the initial and end of the experiment highlighted striking geochemical cycling. CO2, CH4 and N2O production at different depths within the column were quantified from dissolved gas concentrations in pore water. Subsequent emissions from the soil surface were determined by direct measurement in the head space. Pulsed CO2 emission to the headspace was observed at the onset of thawing, however, the magnitude of the pulse decreased with each subsequent freeze-thaw cycle indicating depletion of a “freeze-thaw accessible” carbon pool. Pulsed CO2 emission was due to a combination of physical release of gases dissolved in porewater and entrapped below the frozen zone and changing microbial respiration in response to electron acceptor variability (O2, NO3-, SO42-). In this presentation, we focus on soil-specific physical, chemical, microbial factors (e.g. redox conditions, respiration, fermentation) and the mechanisms that drive GHG emission and nutrient cycling in soils under freeze-thaw cycles.",

            "abstract": "Our improved capability to adapt to future changes in discharge is unavoidably linked to our capability to predict the magnitude or at least the direction of these changes. The importance of improving discharge projections is particularly relevant in an agricultural state like Iowa. Iowa has been affected by a sequence of extreme events over the most recent years, with the flood events of 1993, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2014 interrupted by the droughts of 2012 and summer 2013. It is clear that too much or too little water will have severe economic and societal impacts for this state, and the agricultural U.S. Midwest more generally. Therefore, being able to increase our confidence in the direction and magnitude of the projected changes in discharge (from low to high flow) will be of key importance for improving our mitigation and management strategies during both flooding and droughts.\nHere we focus on the Raccoon River at Van Meter, Iowa, and use a statistical approach to examine projected changes in discharge. We build on statistical models using rainfall and harvested corn and soybean acreage to explain the observed stream flow variability. We then use projections of these two predictors to examine the projected discharge response. Results are based on seven state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) produced under the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). We find that there is not a strong signal of change in the discharge projections under the RCP 4.5. On the other hand, the results for the RCP 8.5 point to a stronger changing signal, in particular increasing trends in the upper part of the discharge distribution. Examination of two hypothetical agricultural scenarios indicates that these increasing trends could be potentially offset by decreasing the extent of the agricultural production. Finally, we discuss how to move forward with the concept of return period for engineering design and management in a non-stationary world.",

            "abstract": "According to the IPCC AR5, the Antarctic sea ice cover expanded during 1979-2012 at a statistically significant rate with a magnitude 1/3 as large as the rapid sea ice retreat in the Arctic. This was a substantial change from the IPCC AR4, which reported the 1979-2005 trend to be considerably smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Both estimates were based on satellite retrievals that use NASA's \"Bootstrap algorithm\" to estimate the sea ice concentration from passive microwave radiometer measurements. The increase in trend between the two IPCC reports has generally been attributed to an acceleration in the ice advance. Here, we show instead that most of the increase occurred due to a change in the way the satellite observations were processed. The Bootstrap algorithm underwent an update in 2007 to make the dataset more consistent with a 2002-2006 record from another satellite, and the entire dataset was reprocessed with the updated algorithm. We find that this reprocessing of the Bootstrap dataset caused a previously undocumented change in the inter-calibration across a 1991 sensor transition, which caused a four-fold increase in the 1979-2006 trend. The question remains whether this undocumented change corrected an error or introduced one. Our analysis is not able to definitively answer this, but the results show that either the older dataset or the newer dataset contains a substantial and previously undocumented inter-calibration error. This suggests that numerous studies that have relied on these observations should be reexamined to determine the sensitivity to this change in inter-calibration. Implications for the uncertainty in satellite sea ice observations will also be discussed. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have investigated physical mechanisms for the observed expansion of the Antarctic sea ice cover. The results of this analysis raise the possibility that much of this apparent expansion may be a spurious artifact of an error in the processing of the satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "When Voyagers 1 and 2 left Earth in 1977, we had little clue as to the rich variety of activity we’d find on the outer Solar System moons. The moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune would likely exhibit little geologic evolution¾much less even than our Moon. We expected battered, cratered, dead worlds. Like the Moon, Mars had showed volcanic activity in the geologic past, but ancient, heavily crater highlands dominated both surfaces. It seemed unlikely that we’d find even extinct volcanism in the cold, dead reaches of the outer Solar System. Voyager 1 shocked us by revealing Io’s prolific ongoing volcanism. (Not all were surprised: just days earlier, Peale, Cassen, and Reynolds published a prediction that Io could be volcanically active). Europa, too, was a Voyager surprise; only a small handful of impact craters pocked its surface. It too had to be a geologically young body—likely still actively evolving. We have even found very recent geological activity on tiny cometary nuclei, where young flows have oozed forth across their surfaces. At Neptune, incredibly, Voyager 2 found eruptions on Triton’s 37K polar cap—plumes driven by solar-heated nitrogen gas blasting dark dust and bright ice in 8-km-high columns. On Mars, “dark spiders” near the pole signaled similar active eruptions, in this case driven by pressurized carbon dioxide. Cassini witnessed a myriad of jets near tiny Enceladus’ south pole, arising from an internal ocean evidently driven by active chemical processes and modulated by Saturn’s proximity. Cassini revealed Titan to be Earth’s alien twin, with a host of processes borrowed from textbooks on terrestrial geomorphology and meteorology. Akin to Earth’s global hydrological cycle, Titan’s runs on methane—methane rivers, seas, and rain abound.\nWhat lessons can we take from these active places into the next phase of exploration? When the Voyagers were launched, our naiveté allowed that only planet Earth was dynamically active. But exploring our cosmic backyard has awed us with unforeseen complexity, scientific beauty, and rich activity. We are now far better armed in our nascent exploration of the worlds beyond that backyard.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency waves (or wavy structures) often emerge in a localized region of the near-Earth plasma sheet and midnight auroral arcs in the course of substorm onset. One of pre-existing auroral arcs becomes active with some spatial structuring into fine-scale forms (also called auroral beads/rays/waves) in several/a few minutes prior to auroral breakup and the evolving individual structures propagate either westward or eastward along the arc. Whereas such a pre-breakup arc signature is believed to reflect the development of near-Earth plasma sheet instability that may trigger the subsequent abrupt expansion of aurora, it still remains to be understood regarding the physical processes operating behind the connection. Here we report on recent progress of our understanding of the pre-breakup auroral arcs, with a particular emphasis on highlighting their key aspects obtained by the ground-based auroral observations. Some of the examples will include comparison with in situ field and particle measurements from spacecraft (such as THEMIS, Van Allen Probes) in the near-Earth tail that were favorable for magnetic conjunction with pre-breakup auroral arc. We will also discuss the implications of these observations on magnetospheric processes involved in the deformation of pre-breakup auroral arcs into smaller structures.",

            "abstract": "Coastal managers require reliable spatial data on the extent and timing of potential coastal inundation, particularly as extreme high sea levels and associated erosion are forecasted to increase in magnitude. Most sea level rise (SLR) vulnerability assessments are undertaken using the easily implemented bathtub approach, where areas adjacent to the sea and below a given elevation are mapped using a deterministic line dividing potentially inundated from dry areas. This method only requires elevation data usually in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM). However, inherent errors in the DEM and spatial analysis propagate into the inundation mapping. Error propagation within spatial modelling can be appropriately analysed using, for example, a probabilistic framework based on geostatistical simulations. Geostatistical modelling takes the spatial correlation in elevation errors into account, which has a significant impact on analyses that include spatial interactions, such as inundation modelling. The aim of this study was to elaborate probability maps incorporating the impacts of spatially variable and spatially correlated elevation errors in high-resolution DEMs combined with sea level rise uncertainties. The spatial variability of elevation errors was partially explained by land cover and terrain variables. Elevation errors were simulated using sequential Gaussian simulation, a Monte Carlo probabilistic approach. Sea level rise uncertainty was non-parametrically modelled using 1000 Monte Carlo estimations which were processed to provide the probability density function numerically. The sea level rise uncertainties were modelled using a Weibull distribution with 0.95 scale and 2.2 shape parameters\n. These uncertainties were combined through addition (i.e., assuming they are independent), and when using probability density distributions, requires a convolution. This probabilistic approach can be used in a risk-aversive decision making process by planning for scenarios with different probabilities of occurrence. For example, results showed that when considering a 1% probability exceedance, the inundated area was ~11% larger than mapped using the deterministic bathtub approach.",

Based on an adaptive balance between structure and function, evolutionary optimisation may provide a feasible tool for analysing such indirect effects of environmental change on forests. This study applies OptiPipe, a model of optimal co-allocation of forest carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), to prediction of potential productivity and C balance of Finnish forests under climate change. OptiPipe is embedded in a transparent modular system including: PreLes, a canopy C exchange model; Yasso, a soil C model; and expert assumptions about the impacts of weather on N availability at different growth sites. National Forest Inventory data and gridded weather data (10 x 10 km2) are utilised. The uncertainties of the projections are analysed relative to inputs and parameters. The results quantify the changes in growth and carbon stocks, which are either smaller or larger than those in photosynthetic capacity, depending on the C:N balance of the site. The results emphasize the need to obtain more reliable information and data about nitrogen processes, but also demonstrate the potential for the optimality approach for regional applications.",

            "abstract": "The minimum in Indian Summer monsoon rainfall is located around Sri Lanka and the ocean below is characterized by a cold pool – having cooler water in comparison to the surrounding region. The meridional gridient in SST between this cold pool and the northern Bay of Bengal has been suggested to be critical for triggering deep atmospheric convection furhter north. As a part of the CTCZ (Continental Tropical Convergence Zone) project under the Indian Climate Research Programme, the first field experiment within the cold pool was conducted during the summer monsoon of 2009 to understand the oceanography of this region. Hydrographic (CTD), ADCP and surface meteorological observations at two time-series locations (TSL) within the core of the Summer Monsoon Current (SMC) during 27 July – 8 August constituted the major data set of this experiment. These observations captured interesting features in both salinity and temperature fields. CTD time series revealed the existence of a salt pump by which the saltier Arabian Sea water located at subsurface layers is pumped up to the surface of the Bay of Bengal. The pumping occurred intermittently during the summer monsoon, in several bursts, along the meandering path of the SMC and is hypothesized to be the mechanism for importing saltier water into the bay in order to maintain the salt balance of the bay. Simulation using an Indian Ocean model reproduces pupming events albeit with certain difference in its characteristics. The temperature data captured two cooling events during the observation period. The first cooling event was during 24 -27 July in which the SST decreased by 0.3°C and the second was during 30 July – 2 August in which the SST dropped by about 0.5°C. These observations were made within the region where cold water is advected eastward by the SMC that carries cooler upwelled water from the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. Estimates of horizontal advection using in situ data sets and simulations using an Indian Ocean model suggest that cooling events taking place within the summer monsoon are controlled by ocean dynamics dominated by the powerful presence of the SMC.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion methods have several advantages as relative geochronometers in volcano-related magmatic processes: diffusion stops on eruption, locking in short timescale information; methods are relatively easy to implement; and suitable material is generally abundant. Such methods also pose significant, accompanying challenges: the need for accurate melt palaeothermometry, uncertainties in diffusion parameters, and sometimes even a cryptic connection between mineral zonation and timescale. As all timescales are relative to an event, timing is not absolute, and care must be taken in interpretation. Yet for all the difficulties, diffusion tools are seeing more widespread usage. This has come about because of the potential of diffusion methods to interrogate certain pre-eruptive processes operating over timescales of relevance to human timescales and responses, having direct bearing on hazard mitigation procedures.\nIn studying subduction zone systems we have a wide range of minerals to choose from but will, in subduction-related, andesitic-to-rhyolitic systems, usually be operating away from the relatively well-constrained system of olivine, and instead be dealing with mineral phases that offer different challenges, such as plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, amphibole, orthopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and mica. Timescales here span a wide range across different mineral-element combinations, from minutes for Li in plagioclase and quartz to days by Fe-Ti oxides, years by orthopyroxene Fe-Mg and decades to millennia with plagioclase, sanidine and quartz.\nThis contribution will focus on the interpretation of diffusion signals in minerals found in subduction-related volcanic systems. To understand what any modelled timescale means, the process which formed the relevant zonation pattern is absolutely key, yet often elusive. Variations in P, T, X conditions really drive the crystallisation process yet certain zonation patterns are non-unique. This ambiguity necessitates painstaking petrological and geochemical detective work to understand where the zoning came from to begin with, and which parameter or parameters were truly driving the zonation. The rewards are insights into short-lived processes occurring in the build up to, or process of, eruption, which are not accessible via other mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Simple mechanistic models of vegetation processes are essential both to our understanding of plant behaviour and to our ability to predict future changes in vegetation. One concept that can take us closer to such models is that of plant optimality, the hypothesis that plants aim to achieve an optimal state. Conceptually, plant optimality can be either structural or functional optimality. A structural constraint would mean that plants aim to achieve a certain structural characteristic such as an allometric relationship or nutrient content that allows optimal function. A functional condition refers to plants achieving optimal functionality, in most cases by maximising carbon gain. Functional optimality conditions are applied on shorter time scales and lead to higher plasticity, making plants more adaptable to changes in their environment. In contrast, structural constraints are optimal given the specific environmental conditions that plants are adapted to and offer less flexibility. We exemplify these concepts using a simple model of crop growth. The model represents annual cycles of growth from sowing date to harvest, including both vegetative and reproductive growth and phenology. Structural constraints to growth are represented as an optimal C:N ratio in all plant organs, which drives allocation throughout the vegetative growing stage. Reproductive phenology - i.e. the onset of flowering and grain filling - is determined by a functional optimality condition in the form of maximising final seed mass, so that vegetative growth stops when the plant reaches maximum nitrogen or carbon uptake. We investigate the plants' response to variations in environmental conditions within these two optimality constraints and show that final yield is most affected by changes during vegetative growth which affect the structural constraint.",

The citizen-seismologists-in-Taiwan project is designed to elevate the quality of earthquake science education by means of incorporating earthquake/tsunami stories and near-real time earthquake games competition into the traditional curricula in schools. Through pilot of courses and professional development workshops, we have worked closely with teachers from elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, to design workable teaching plans through a practical operation of seismic monitoring at home or school. We will introduce how the 9-years-old do P- and S-wave picking and measure seismic intensity through interactive learning platform, how do scientists and school teachers work together, and how do we create an environment to facilitate continuous learning (i.e., near-real time earthquake games competition), to make earthquake science fun.",

            "abstract": "It is important to understand how new subduction zones form. Some subduction zones begin spontaneously, with sinking of dense oceanic lithosphere adjacent to a lithospheric weakness. The Eocene evolution of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin is the type example of this process, with an increasingly well-documented evolution including results from IODP 352 drilling. A lack of any active examples of spontaneous SI hinders our understanding, but our studies of the evolution of the southernmost Mariana convergent margin provides important insights. Here the Mariana Trough backarc basin terminates against the Challenger Deep trench segment, where it has opened ~250 km in the past ~4 Ma. This corresponds to GPS opening rate of ~4.5cm/y at the latitude of Guam (Kato et al., 2003). This newly formed and rapidy widening margin faces the NW-converging Pacific plate and causes it to contort and tear. Pacific plate continues to move NW but the upper plate response is illustrative of a newly formed subduction zone. Slab-related earthquakes can be identified to ~200 km deep beneath this margin; with convergence rate of 3cm/yr, this may reflect no more than 7 Ma of subduction. The usual well-defined magmatic arc is missing; its position ~100 km above the subducted slab is occupied by the magma-rich (inflated) Malaguana-Gadao Ridge (MGR), and hydrous MORB-like basalts with ~2 wt. % H2O have erupted unusually close to the trench where they overly mantle peridotites ~6 km water depth. HMR-1 sonar backscatter mapping reveals a chaotic fabric that is at a high angle to the trend of the MGR to the east but is concordant to the west. This unusual spreading fabric may have formed by chaotic upper plate extension in response to rapid rollback of the short, narrow Pacific slab in a manner similar to that thought to occur during SI. Further interdisciplinary studies are needed to understand this rapidly-evolving tectono-magmatic province and what it can teach us about SI.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how subduction zones initiate and continental crust forms in intraoceanic arcs requires knowledge of the inception and evolution of a representative intraoceanic arc, such as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) Arc system. This can be obtained by exploring regions adjacent to an arc, where unequivocal pre-arc crust overlain by undisturbed arc-derived materials exists. IODP Exp. 351 (June-July 2014) specifically targeted evidence for the earliest evolution of the IBM system following inception. Site U1438 (4711 m water depth) is located in the Amami Sankaku Basin (ASB), west of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR), a paleo-IBM arc. Primary objectives of Exp. 351 were: 1) determine the nature of the crust and mantle pre-existing the IBM arc; 2) identify and model the process of subduction initiation and initial arc crust formation; 3) determine the compositional evolution of the IBM arc during the Paleogene; 4) establish geophysical properties of the ASB. Seismic reflection profiles indicate a ~1.3 km thick sediment layer overlying ~5.5 km thick igneous crust, presumed to be oceanic. This igneous crust seemed likely to be the basement of the IBM arc. Four holes were cored at Site U1438 spanning the entire sediment section and into basement. The cored interval comprises 5 units: uppermost Unit I is hemipelagic sediment with intercalated ash layers, presumably recording explosive volcanism mainly from the Ryukyu and Kyushu arcs; Units II and III host a series of volcaniclastic gravity-flow deposits, likely recording the magmatic history of the IBM Arc from arc initiation until 25 Ma; Siliceous pelagic sediment (Unit IV) underlies these deposits with minimal coarse-grained sediment input and may pre-date arc initiation. Sediment-basement contact occurs at 1461 mbsf. A basaltic lava flow section dominantly composed of plagioclase and clinopyroxene with rare chilled margins continues to the bottom of the Site (1611 mbsf). The expedition successfully recovered pre-IBM Arc basement, a volcanic and geologic record spanning pre-Arc, Arc initiation to remnant Arc stages, which permits testing for subduction initiation and subsequent Arc evolution.",

            "abstract": "The challenge posed by human-induced climate change to society and the natural environment has been established by thousands of peer-reviewed studies, many of which have appeared in AGU journals and have been presented at AGU meetings such as this one. This literature has in turn been carefully and methodically summarized by decades’ worth of exhaustive reports by Royal Societies, National Academies, federal agencies, and the IPCC, many of which clearly document the solid science, the emerging consequences, and the future risks of climate change at the global, national, and even regional scale.\nIn the U.S., the most recent Third National Climate Assessment vividly illustrates how warming temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and increasing risk of weather extremes are already affecting agriculture, infrastructure, human health, natural resources, and water supplies. In many sectors, the risk of severe and even potentially dangerous impacts increases with higher levels of carbon emissions and global warming.\nAs the scientific evidence builds, however, public and political opinion in the U.S.—as well as in other developed nations including Australia, the U.K., and Canada—remains sharply divided. Social science has established that this divergence in opinions on global warming tends to run along ideological, socio-economic, religious, and even racial lines. Polling has also shown how public polarization on climate change has increased, rather than decreased, over time.\nUnderstanding the reasons that have created and fed this polarization is crucial to the success of outreach efforts that attempt to bridge this divide. The main reason for this divergence is not a deficit of information or knowledge among the public. Instead, there are a plethora of causes that can be variously categorized as psychological, societal, political, and economic. The diversity of these barriers helps explain why no single message or campaign has been able to successfully turn the tide of public opinion. By identifying each of these barriers, however, I will share from my experience how it is possible to bypass much of the “he said-she said” stalemate that occurs in media and outreach activities, transitioning instead towards positive discussion based on a foundation of shared values and concern.",

            "abstract": "Human-induced climate change is altering the risk of many types of weather extremes, including the frequency and/or severity of heavy precipitation events. The basic science connecting global warming to more frequent heavy precipitation is relative straightforward. It is far more challenging, however, to predict how climate change will affect the magnitude and frequency of these events at the relatively fine spatial scales at which the impacts of extreme rainfall, snow storms, and flooding are typically characterized.\nUsing a case study based on a set of geographically distributed long-term weather stations located at Dept. of Defense installations across the U.S., we explore the individual and combined contributions of high-resolution regional climate modeling (WRF), station-based statistical downscaling (ARRM), extreme value distributions (GEV), and the use of global mean temperature-based thresholds rather than time slices (an approach that is illustrated Figure 1) to resolve observed trends and narrow the envelope of projected future change. All projections and analyses are based on the CESM1-MOAR simulation driven by the higher RCP 8.5 scenario, a consistency specifically introduced into the experiment in order to better resolve the strengths and limitations of each method in understanding extreme precipitation trends.\nEach of these approaches provides clear added value when compared to direct output from the global climate model. We also find that the ability to refine global model output using high-resolution physical modeling, statistics, and observations can all prove useful at different geographic locations and for different parts of the distribution. However, the primary conclusion of this analysis is the utility of combining multiple physical and statistical modeling and analysis approaches when addressing issues such as extreme precipitation that occur at the tails of the distribution.",

            "abstract": "Deviatoric stress profoundly influences the distribution of melt in viscously deforming, partially molten rocks. Under hydrostatic stress melt forms an interconnected network, primarily along grain edges (triple junctions) to reach a state of minimum interfacial energy. Melt also wets a fraction of the grain boundaries due to anisotropy in solid-melt interfacial energy. Under a non-hydrostatic state of stress melt quickly redistributes at the grain scale, introducing a pronounced melt preferred orientation. Melt pockets align at the grain scale with their long axes 15 to 30o to the maximum principal stress in triaxial compression experiments and at 15-40o to the shear plane, antithetic to the shear direction, in shear experiments. This stress-induced, grain-scale alignment of melt gives rise to anisotropic viscosity of the solid/melt aggregate. In response, melt redistributes over distances larger than the grain scale. Two types of redistribution occur. First, in torsion experiments, a diffuse (base-state) migration of melt occurs from the outer radius toward the axis of the cylindrical sample. Second, in simple shear and torsion experiments, melt spontaneously segregates into melt-rich bands spaced at distances smaller than the compaction length. The occurrence of both base-state melt migration and melt-rich band formation are observed in laboratory experiments and modelled using two-phase flow theory. In intensely deforming regions of Earth’s upper mantle, melt-rich bands may provide high-permeability pathways that host rapid extraction of melt and zones of weakness that localize deformation. Moreover, they may be detected as regions of reduced seismic velocity and increased seismic anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "The way that water is stored within and transmitted through structured porous media can be challenging to infer from available observation techniques, in particular at field scales. Fractured porous media are an example of such structured media, comprising a fracture domain and a matrix domain. Flow processes depend on how water is both stored and transmitted within each domain, and how water exchanges between the domains. In unsaturated conditions the problem is confounded as hydraulic properties (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) in each domain become dynamic, as a function of saturation. One domain may not contribute significantly to the flow, or may not provide significant amounts of storage, depending of the properties of both domains. The two domains may or may not respond in equilibrium with one another, depending on both the properties and on driving boundary conditions (i.e. infiltration intensity). Physically based models can in theory be used to falsify hypotheses about the role of the fractures versus the matrix in transmitting flow, within an inverse modelling framework. However, there are two problems: firstly, even the most detailed and complex physically based model will still be a simplification of reality, unable to resolve heterogeneities that exist; and secondly the observations available may not contain sufficient information to constrain the model. In this study we explore how models and observations have been applied to understand the flow processes in the unsaturated Chalk in field sites in south east England. We look at what can and cannot be inferred from various observations, including the water table response, soil moisture and matric potential, and the power of these observations to constrain models. We look at how models provide a framework through which to interpret the observations, and provide insights into the dominant controls on behavior. In the case of the unsaturated Chalk, we have demonstrated that groundwater recharge is transmitted through both the fractures and the matrix. Matrix saturated hydraulic conductivity is found to be the dominant parametric control on partitioning of flow. The characteristics of individual rainfall events, combined with near surface soil moisture content, are shown to be good predictors of rapid, preferential recharge.",

On a global scale, the mass loss from glaciers contributes to sea-level rise. On regional and local scales, glacier meltwater is an important contributor to and modulator of river flow. Until recently, the lack of basic inventory data was a major impediment in global mass balance assessments and projections. The recently completed Randolph Glacier Inventory, the first globally complete glacier inventory, is a major forward step towards reducing uncertainties in global-scale studies. In this talk I will review some of the recent attempts to model glacier mass changes on regional and global scales, and discuss the main challenges these models face. Particular emphasis will be given to the use of glacier mass balance observations in model calibration and evaluation.",

            "abstract": "In the United States, fewer than one-third of Republicans believe that climate change is driven significantly by burning fossil fuels. This despite unprecedented worldwide scientific consensus that it is. Over 13,000 peer reviewed scientific papers affirm it. Twenty-four deny it. Yet the Republican “disbelief” persists in part because of ideological bubbles that, according to analysis by the Marquette Law School, are deeper and more geographically based than ever before. More and more Americans are living in politically one-sided counties, with 51% of voters in the 2012 presidential race living in a county that was “partisan” – or 10 points redder or bluer than the U.S. as a whole. One in five lived in a county that was “extreme” – or 20 points redder or bluer than the country.\nWith mainstream media contracting, opinion media exploding and the Internet increasingly giving us only what we want to hear, ideological bubbles are becoming more isolated and insulated than ever. Dan Kahan at Yale has discovered that these bubbles – the values and groups that hold them – have a greater impact on our perception of certain issues than scientific understanding. In fact, the more individuals become scientifically literate, the more they tend to use that information to confirm the view of their group. So the more conservative and more knowledgeable you are about climate change, the less convinced you will be that it is a problem.\nCountless scientific studies confirm people rely on those they trust. And conversely, they reject information coming from those they do not. To bridge the partisan divide, and break the ideological barriers to climate science, trusted leaders within conservative circles must engage and speak out. The conservative leaders I work with have transcended their ideological boundaries, understand the science largely because they have learned from people they trust, recognize the risk and have identified solutions that protect their conservative values.",

            "abstract": "Podiform chromitites in Luobusa ophiolite, southern Tibet, yield a wide variety of unusual minerals, including UHP minerals (micro-diamond, coesite, moissanite), highly reduced minerals (native elements, carbide, nitride, alloys), and crustal minerals (quartz, kyanite, zircon etc.). We report unusual silicate exsolution lamellae (coesite, clinopyroxene and MgSiO3 phase) in chromite (Yamamoto et al., 2009), and unusual ancient crustal zircons from chromitites (Yamamoto et al., 2013). To deduce long history of mantle convection, including both upward mantle-upwelling and horizontal movement, micro-inclusions preserved in refractory minerals can provide potential mineralogical and geochemical evidence. Coesite as an exsolution in chromite is diagnostic UHP evidence and clinopyroxene exsolution in chromite is possible evidence of former CF-type high-pressure polymorph of chromite (>380 km deep). More importantly, we found that silicate exsolutions in chromites are restricted in the nodular- and massive-type chromites, and that disseminated-type chromites have no exsolutions. Petrographically, nodular-type chromites with abundant silicate-exsolutions are gradually modified into disseminated-type chromites in their morphology and exsolution abundance. The characteristic of the disseminated-type chromite, such as their interstitial distribution, euhedral to subhedral morphology and absence of silicate-exsolutions, suggest their formation under the low-pressure magmatic conditions. Therefore, we propose that the podiform chromitites at the Luobusa retain evidence of their multi-stage development from ultrahigh-pressure environment to low-pressure magmatic processes, and tiny inclusions shielded by refractory minerals, such as chromite, diamond and zircon, record their prolonged history in the mantle.",

            "abstract": "A prevailing challenge in multiscale simulation is to achieve robustness for general problems. In particular, we are interested in problems where the multiscale approximation is of almost sufficient accuracy, but may be unacceptable due to lack of uniform scale separation in the domain. In this setting, it is of interest to find efficient approaches that do not require a completely new analysis of the problem, or a resolved fine-scale approximation.\nWe thus consider multiscale methods in the framework of domain decomposition and multigrid techniques. Our objective is to formulate linear and non-linear solvers, possessing the following properties: 1) The initial iteration is identical to a multiscale approximation. 2) Further iterations reduce the approximation error with comparable efficiency to dedicated fine-scale solvers. 3) The error can be controlled by explicitly computable error bounds.\nWe give examples from a range of applications, including large-scale simulation of CO2 storage, mechanical deformation of heterogeneous poroelastic materials, and flow and heat transfer in highly fractured porous media associated with geothermal energy recovery. The latter application is illustrated in the figures, where we compare the A) Multiscale approximation, B) Approximation with intermediate accuracy, and C) Fine-scale solution for the problem.",

            "abstract": "The heights and expansion rate of eruption cloud and the dispersal pattern of tephra particles are key observable data for understanding the dynamics of volcanic plume. In general, when the volcanic plume rises in a stationary environment, the plume height and expansion rate of the umbrella cloud increases as the eruption intensity (i.e., the magma discharge rate) increases. On the other hand, when the plume is distorted by the atmospheric wind, it is difficult to quantify the relationship between the eruption conditions and the observable data. Therefore, we aim to develop a three-dimensional numerical model of volcanic plume and directly reproduce the plume dynamics and the tephra dispersal.\nWe performed a numerical simulation of the 2014 eruption at Mount Kelud, Java, Indonesia, which formed a large volcanic plume and umbrella cloud in the wind field. We employ a 3D numerical model which is designed to simulate the injection of tephra particles and volcanic gas from a circular vent into the stratified atmosphere, using a combination of a pseudo-gas model for fluid motion and a Lagrangian model for particle motion (Suzuki and Koyaguchi, 2013 EPS). Using the estimated total mass (3.9—6.4×1011 kg) and the eruption duration (2.5 – 3 hours), the average mass discharge rate is estimated to be 3.6—7.1×107 kg/s. In this study, the magma discharge rate is set to be 5×107 kg/s. The weather data based on the radiosonde observation in Surabaya is applied to the atmospheric condition.\nThe simulation results indicate that the top of plume reaches to nearly 30 km and the umbrella cloud radially spreads at the height of 17—20 km high. These simulated heights are consistent with the observations (e.g., NASA Earth Observatory). The particles are transported by the gravity current of the umbrella cloud. Between the umbrella cloud and the ground, the particles separated from the cloud are drifted by the easterly wind. Therefore, the dispersal axis of the main fall deposits simulated by the present model agrees well with the observation. However, the present simulation cannot reproduce the fall deposits on the north and northeast area of the volcano. This inconsistency implies that in reality, unlike the conditions assumed in our model, the eruption intensity and atmospheric condition fluctuated largely with time.",

The mission delivers observations that provide new insight into the Earth system by improving our understanding of the Earth’s interior as well as the near Earth electro-magnetic environment. The unprecedented high-accuracy and high spatial resolution measurements of the strength, direction and time variations of the magnetic field, complemented by precise navigation, accelerometer and electric field measurements, provide the required observations to model the various sources of the geomagnetic field.\nThe three satellites fly in a constellation. Swarm Alpha and Charlie are orbiting almost next to each other at a distance of about 150 km at the equator and Charlie is approximately 10 seconds delayed relative to Alpha. At the start of the science phase they were injected at an altitude of 462 km and an inclination of 87.35°, in naturally decaying orbits. Swarm Bravo started in a higher orbit at 510 km with an inclination of 87.75°. This causes a relative drift between Alpha/Charlie and Bravo resulting in a local time difference of about 6 hours in the third year of the mission. Different objectives of the mission may benefit more during different phases of the constellation. This presentation will include the mission status a year after launch and focus on the products, studies and results related to the external fields.",

            "abstract": "The theory of plate tectonics has been one of the major breakthroughs in solid-Earth science and is capable of explaining many of the tectonic processes on present-day Earth. Moreover, it allows us to reconstruct Earth’s tectonic history back until times of the supercontinent Pangaea and thus improves our understanding how Earth developed to its present state. However, plate tectonics remains a kinematic theory that does not sufficiently incorporate the balance of forces in the Earth’s mantle and can thus not explain the motion of Earth’s tectonic plates in a dynamically consistent manner.\nHere, we use fully dynamic models of mantle convection in global spherical geometry to overcome this issue. These models include tectonic plates self-consistently evolving from mantle flow (using a viscoplastic rheology) as well as continental drift. We analyze the evolution of plate velocities over time periods considerably longer than those covered by modern plate reconstructions. We observe significant changes in plate velocity magnitude and direction over timescales relevant for the Earth. While some of these plate reorganizations appear to be rather local affecting only very few plates, others seem to have more global consequences.\nWe characterize the variety of different reorganizations based on features of modeled spreading centers and subduction zones, for instance the flux of slab material into the lower mantle. Initial results suggest that global changes in plate configuration correlate with phases of major slab penetration into the lower mantle, while changes on individual plate-scale do not necessarily do so.",

            "abstract": "Relative sea-level variations during the late Pleistocene can only be reconstructed with the knowledge of ice-sheet history. On the other hand, the knowledge of regional and global relative sea-level variations is necessary to learn about the changes in ice volume. Overcoming this problem of circularity demands a fully coupled system where ice sheets and sea level vary consistently in space and time and dynamically affect each other. Here we present results for the last glacial cycle from the coupling of a set of 3-D ice-sheet-shelf models to a global sea-level model based on the solution of the gravitationally self-consistent sea-level equation. The sea-level model incorporates all the glacial isostatic adjustment feedbacks for a Maxwell viscoelastic and rotating Earth model with variable coastlines. Ice volume is computed with four 3-D ice-sheet-shelf models for North America, Eurasia, Greenland and Antarctica. With an inverse approach, ice volume and temperature are derived from a benthic δ18O stacked record. The derived surface-air temperature anomaly is applied on the present-day climatology to simulate glacial-interglacial changes in temperature and hence ice volume. The ice-sheet thickness variations are forwarded to the sea-level model to compute the bedrock deformation, the change in sea-surface height and thus the relative sea-level change. The latter is coupled back to the ice-sheet models. Due to rotational effects, local isostatic depression and growth or collapse of the forebulge, RSL differences can reach up to 100 m between different locations over the globe. Additionally, ice-sheet model parameters have been varied such that we come up with a suite of different modelling results of ice volume and accompanying global RSL over the last glacial cycle. Subsequently, we will present a first-order comparison of our results with RSL reconstructions derived from geological and archaeological paleo sea-level indicators over the globe.",

First, in addition to the strong millennial AMOC variability forced by melting water fluxes, the background AMOC is determined by two opposing effects: the intensification by the rising atmospheric CO2 and the reduction by the retreating ice sheet, both through the sea ice feedbacks in the North Atlantic. As a result, the AMOC strength does not change significantly after the deglaciation. Second, the model AMOC exhibits a monostable behavior. This monostable AMOC, which has been observed in almost all state-of-art coupled general climate models (CGCMs), is likely to be caused by a systematic model bias that is associated with the tropical bias, the resulted freshwater flux and AMOC freshwater export. This AMOC over-stabilization bias needs to be improved in these CGCMs to allow for a credible projection of AMOC evolution in the future.",

            "abstract": "The increasing global use of road salt deicers has led to an influx of salts, particularly NaCl and CaCl2, into urban surface waters. This influx has led to documented salinization of drinking water supplies, as well as damage to ecosystems. There is an increasing recognition that the influx of road salt deciers may also influence the physical mixing of lakes, with dramatic consequences for lake biogeochemistry. In this study, the water column chemistry of two kettle lakes in urban Kalamazoo, MI, USA was monitored for over a year. Woods Lake, an ~9.7 ha, 14 m max depth lake, receives most water from storm water sewers, whereas nearby Asylum Lake, an ~19.8 ha, 15.8 m max depth lake, is primarily groundwater fed. The water columns of both lakes are strongly redox stratified, but exhibit some significant differences in water chemistry. The input of road salt has caused Woods Lake to transition to meromixis, with permanently anoxic bottom waters and significant accumulations of dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), NH3, PO4-3 and sometimes HS- in the hypolimnion. In contrast, Asylum Lake appears to be monomictic, with turnover occurring in fall, but not spring. During most seasons, the hypolimnion of Asylum Lake has significant levels of dissolved Mn(II), NH3, PO4-3, and sometimes HS-, but dissolved Fe(II) remains below detection limits. A comparison of δ18O and δD with the local meteoric water line demonstrates that both lakes undergo significant evaporation. Woods Lake is considerably more influenced by evaporation than Asylum Lake, presumably due to the longer residence time of water in Woods Lake. The longer residence time, together with the smaller volume of water in Woods Lake, likely explains the more rapid transition to meromixis compared to Asylum Lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers can significantly influence the biogeochemistry and physical function of urban lakes, and in some cases can result in dimictic lakes transitioning to cultural meromixis.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault is a major plate-boundary fault zone that poses a significant seismic hazard in southern New Zealand, with the next major earthquake expected to be imminent. Core samples from the Alpine Fault were recovered from two Deep Fault Drilling Project pilot boreholes that penetrated the principal slip zone (PSZ). We show here that at room temperature and low effective stress (30 MPa), materials from within and very near the PSZ are weaker than the surrounding cataclasites (µ = 0.45), exhibit velocity-strengthening friction, and also tend to restrengthen (heal) rapidly. Under conditions appropriate for several kilometers depth on the Alpine Fault (100 MPa, 160 °C, fluid-saturated), a cataclasite/gouge sample located very near to the PSZ exhibits µ = 0.67, which is high compared to measurements performed at lower pressures and temperatures for the Alpine Fault and other major fault zones sampled by scientific drilling. Every major lithological unit tested under elevated P-T conditions exhibits both positive and negative values of friction velocity-dependence suggesting that they are all capable of earthquake nucleation. Using representative values of the friction velocity-dependent parameter a-b, the critical slip distance Dc, and previously documented elastic properties of the wall rock, estimated critical nucleation patch lengths may be as low as ~3 m. This small value is consistent with a seismic moment Mo = ~4x1010 or a Mw = ~1, which suggests that events of this size or larger are expected to occur as normal earthquakes and that slow or transient slip events are unlikely in the approximate depth range of 3-7 km. In conjunction with previous geodetic and seismologic observations, our results indicate that the Alpine Fault has a high potential for frictional instability throughout the brittle crust, in contrast with other major fault zones on which the uppermost portion is relatively stable.",

            "abstract": "Noting that cool phone in your pocket, and your car have more sensors and wireless capabilities than your new Campbell weather station, does it ever feel like there is a mismatch between the world of science and that of consumer products? How can we understand our place in the “sensing ecosystem,” and sort between the transformative opportunities of sensing technology and technological land mines that will expend your budget and be unreliable? Here I review the impact of three technological frameworks on biogeochemical observation: distributed fiber optic sensing; low-power radio and GSM communication; and 3-D printing. From the fiber optic sensing applications in air, soil, rivers, oceans and wells, we see that this truly does qualify as a revolutionary observational platform. Specifically, it densely spans the critical 0.1 m to 10,000 m spatial scales and 1 to 1,000,000 s temporal scales, providing opportunity to address long-standing fundamental open questions. This is placed in contrast to the unfulfilled promises touted by the self-organizing mesh network radio technology. We argue that this outcome reflects a lack of candor of technology insiders in the selling of this technology with respect to the potential given the 1/r^3 energy of radio communication combined with the challenges of environmental settings for wave propagation (e.g., intense rain, snow laden branches, and long periods of low solar radiation). This is contrasted with the excellent outcomes of GSM-based monitoring approaches that leveraged the massive infrastructure of cellular telephones. Finally, I will venture to explain why open-source 3-D printing technology will provide the next transformative opportunity for Biogeosicences by re-inventing point-sensing instrumentation.",

            "abstract": "Ocean waves provide most of the energy that feeds the continuous vertical oscillations of the solid Earth. Three period bands are usually identified. The hum contains periods longer than 30 s, and the primary and secondary peaks are usually centered around 15 and 5 s, respectively. Motions in all three bands are recorded everywhere on our planet and can provide information on both the solid Earth structure and the ocean wave climate over the past century. Here we describe recent efforts to extend the range of validity of ocean wave models to cover periods from 1 to 300 s (Ardhuin et al., Ocean Modelling 2014), and the resulting public database of ocean wave spectra (http://tinyurl.com/iowagaftp/HINDCAST/ ).\nWe particularly discuss the sources of uncertainty for building a numerical model of acoustic and seismic noise on this knowledge of ocean wave spectra. For acoustic periods shorter than 3 seconds, the main uncertainties are the directional distributions of wave energy (Ardhuin et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 2013). For intermediate periods (3 to 25 s), the propagation properties of seismic waves are probably the main source of error when producing synthetic spectra of Rayleigh waves (Ardhuin et al. JGR 2011, Stutzmann et al. GJI 2012). For the longer periods (25 to 300 s), the poor knowledge of the bottom topography details may be the limiting factor for estimating hum spectra or inverting hum measurements in properties of the infragravity wave field. All in all, the space and time variability of recorded seismic and acoustic spectra is generally well reproduced in the band 3 to 300 s, and work on shorter periods is under way. This direct model can be used to search for missing noise sources, such as wave scattering in the marginal ice zone, find events relevant for solid earth studies (e.g. Obrebski et al. JGR 2013) or invert wave climate properties from microseismic records.\nThe figure shows measured spectra of the vertical ground acceleration, and modeled result for the primary and secondary mechanisms using our numerical wave model.

In 2009, under Secretarial Order 3289, Interior created eight regional Climate Science Centers managed by the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and in partnership with universities. Secretarial Order 3289 provides a framework to coordinate climate change science and adaptation efforts across Interior and to integrate science and resource management expertise from Federal, State, Tribal, private, non-profit, and academic partners.\nIn addition to broad research expertise, these Federal/university partnerships provide opportunities to develop a next generation of climate science professionals. These include opportunities to increase the climate science knowledge base of students and practicing professionals; build students’ skills in working across the boundary between research and implementation; facilitate networking among researchers, students, and professionals for the application of research to on-the-ground issues; and support the science pipeline in climate-related fields through structured, intensive professional development.\nIn 2013, Climate Science Centers supported approximately 10 undergraduates, 60 graduate students, and 26 postdoctoral researchers. Additional students trained by Climate Science Center-affiliated faculty also contribute valuable time and expertise, and are effectively part of the Climate Science Center network. The Climate Science Centers’ education and training efforts have also reached a number of high school students interested in STEM careers, and professionals in natural and cultural resource management.\nThe Climate Science Centers are coordinating to build on each other’s successful education and training efforts. Early successes include several intensive education experiences, such as the Alaska Climate Science Center’s Girls on Ice, the Northeast’s Consortium Retreat, the Northwest’s Climate Science Boot Camp; the whole-network Early Career Climate Forum; the South Central Climate Science Center’s Minority Internship; and a growing curriculum through Interior’s National Conservation Training Center.",

            "abstract": "The marine record of the ocean lithium isotope composition may provide important information constraining the factors that control continental weathering and how they have varied in the past. However, the equations establishing the links between the continental flux of Li to the ocean, its Li isotope composition and the ocean Li isotope composition are under-constrained, and their resolution are related to significant uncertainties. In order to partially reduce this uncertainty, we propose a new approach that couples the C and Li cycles, such that our proposed reconstruction of the Cenozoic Li cycle is compatible with the required stability of the exospheric carbon cycle on geological timescales. The results of this exercise show, contrary to expectations, that the Li isotope composition of rivers exerts only a minor influence on the d7Li of the ocean. In contrast, variations in the continental flux of Li to the ocean are demonstrated to play a major role in setting the ocean d7Li. We also provide evidence that Li storage in soils is an important element of the global Li cycle that cannot be neglected during the Cenozoic. Our modeling of the published foraminifera record highlight a close link between soil formation rate and indexes recording the climate evolution during the Cenozoic, such as foraminifera d18O and pCO2 reconstructions. This leads us to propose that climate exerted a dominant control on soil production and therefore on continental weathering during the last 70 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial fill terraces provide a record of changes in sediment production and/or transport in response to external forcing. The N-S striking Humahuaca intermontane basin (Eastern Cordillera, NW Argentina) parallels the eastern margin of the Puna Plateau and is known for frequent landslides/debris flows during the wet season and protracted past wet periods. Fill terraces along tributaries (with 20-1100 km2 catchments) to the trunk stream are dated with OSL to between ~30 and 120 ka. Aggradation phases on the west side of the basin correlate with past wet periods, and those on the east side with dry periods. The difference may arise because the river-network geometry of eastern catchments promotes sediment storage, resulting in delayed sediment delivery to the trunk stream and/or a higher threshold to erosion and sediment transport. Cosmogenic nuclide (10Be) concentrations of sand (<0.7 cm) and pebbles (1-3 cm) reveal that in modern stream sediments, (1) denudation rates from sand (<0.1 mm/yr) overlap with bedrock erosion rates, (2) denudation rates from pebbles are 1.2 to 4x higher, which could reflect the importance of mass movements, and (3) eastern catchments yield lower rates. From wet-phase (west side) terraces, denudation rates are higher than those from modern streams, while highly scattered pebble denudation rates of 0.1-10 mm/yr may reflect an increased frequency of mass movements in past wetter periods. In contrast, dry-phase (east side) terrace pebble and sand denudation rates overlap with modern rates, 26Al/10Be ratios are low, and a sample from the sediment storage zone has a relatively high pebble denudation rate of 0.3 mm/yr. We interpret the patterns to imply that mass movements are triggered throughout the valley during wet climate phases and induce aggradation, but slow re-excavation of stored sediments from eastern catchments leads to increased 10Be concentrations and delayed sediment delivery to the main valley. Such behavior at an orogen scale could attenuate or mask landscape responses to climate forcing.",

            "abstract": "Many subduction zones retreat while hotspots remain sufficiently stable in the mantle to provide an approximate reference frame. As a consequence, the mantle can be thought of as an unusual convecting system which self-organises to promote frequent collisions of downgoing material with upwellings.\nWe present three 3D numerical models of subduction where buoyant material from a plume head and an associated ocean-island chain or plateau produce flat slab subduction and deformation of the over-riding plate. We observe transient instabilities of the convergent margin including: contorted trench geometry; trench migration parallel with the plate margin; folding of the subducting slab and orocline development at the convergent margin; and transfer of the plateau to the overriding plate.\nThe presence of plume material beneath the oceanic plateau causes flat subduction above the plume, resulting in a “bowed” shaped subducting slab. In the absence of a plateau at the surface, the slab can remain uncoupled from the over-riding plate during very shallow subduction and hence there is very little shortening at the surface or advance of the plate boundary.\nIn plateau-only models, plateau accretion at the edge of the overriding plate results in trench migration around the edge of the plateau before subduction re-establishes directly behind the trailing edge of the plateau. The plateau shortens during accretion and some plateau material subducts.\nIn a plateau-plus-plume model, accretion is associated with rapid trench advance as the flat slab drives the plateau into the margin. This indentation stops once a new convergent boundary forms close to the original trench location. A slab window formed beneath the accreted plateau allows plume material to flow from beneath the subducting plate to the underside of the overriding plate.\nIn all of these models the subduction zone maintains a relatively stable configuration away from the buoyancy anomalies within the downgoing plate. The models provide a dynamic context for plateau and plume accretion in accretionary orogenic systems.",

            "abstract": "Firstly, we present new results related to the lithospheric structure and tectonics of the Central Europe and the Western Carpathians. For geophysical study of the lithosphere in Central Europe we calculated four original 2D lithosphere-scales transects crossing this area from the West European Platform in the North to the Aegean Sea in the South and from the Adriatic Sea in the West to the East European Platform in the East. Modelling is based on the joint interpretation of gravity, geoid, topography and surface heat flow data with temperature-dependent density. Wherever possible, crustal structure is constrained by seismic data. The thickness of the lithosphere decreases from the older and colder platforms to the younger and hotter Pannonian Basin with a maximum thickness under the Eastern and Southern Carpathians. The thickness of the Carpathian arc lithosphere varies between 150 km in the North (the Western Carpathians) and about 300 km in the Vrancea zone (the Eastern and Southern Carpathian junction). In the Platform areas it is between 120 and 150 km and in the Pannonian Basin it is about 70 km. The models show that the Moesian Platform is overthrust from the North by the Southern Carpathians and from the South by the Balkanides and characterized by bending of this platform. In all transects, the thickest crust is found underneath the Carpathian Mountains or, as in the case of the Vrancea area, under their immediate foreland. The thickest crust outside the orogens is modelled for the Moesian Platform with Moho depths of up to 45 km. The thinnest crust is located under the Pannonian Basin with about 26-27 km.\nSecondly, our presentation deals with construction of the stripped gravity map in the Turiec Basin, which represents typical intramontane Neogene depression of the Western Carpathians. Based on this new and original gravity map corrected by regional gravity effect we were able to interpret the geological structure and tectonics of this sedimentary basin.\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Grant Agency VEGA (grants No. 1/0095/12, 2/0067/12) and Slovak Research and Development Agency (grants No. APVV-0827-12, APVV-0194-10).",

            "abstract": "Sediment recycling is expected in many tectonic settings, such as foreland basins, where the path followed by grains initially derived from erosion of a basement source region typically involves significant intermediate stages of crustal evolution before the detritus is finally incorporated into tectonically stable basin strata. The shallow-crustal thermal histories experienced by eroded sediment may go undetected by traditional provenance methods but are potentially recoverable by thermochronologic methods. The Patagonian Magallanes retroarc foreland basin affords an excellent case study of sediment burial and recycling within a thrust belt setting. Combined detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and (U-Th)/He thermochronology data and thermal modeling results confirm delivery of both rapidly cooled, first-cycle volcanogenic sediments from the Patagonian magmatic arc and recycled sediment from deeply buried and exhumed Cretaceous foredeep strata to the Cenozoic Magallanes basin depocenter. Numerical models of temperature-time histories indicate that ca. 54-45 Ma burial of the Maastrichtian Dorotea Formation produced 164-180°C conditions and heating to within the zircon He partial retention zone. Such deep burial is unusual for Andean foreland basins and may have resulted from combined effects of high basal heat flow and high sediment accumulation within a rapidly subsiding foredeep that was floored by basement weakened by previous Late Jurassic rifting. In this interpretation, Cenozoic thrust-related deformation deeply eroded the Dorotea Formation and underlying strata from ~5 km burial depths and may be associated with the development of a regionally extensive Paleogene unconformity. Results from the Cenozoic Río Turbio and Santa Cruz formations confirm that they contain both Cenozoic first-cycle zircon from the Patagonian magmatic arc and highly outgassed recycled zircon. This work suggests that Middle Miocene sediments were most likely derived from recycling of deeply buried Upper Cretaceous strata in the Patagonian thrust belt. These findings contribute new understanding to Patagonian foreland basin evolution and provide insight into the broader interactions between tectonics and sedimentation and signals of sediment recycling in convergent basins.",

            "abstract": "Detailed constraints on erosional flux are critical for understanding how exhumational processes control and respond to tectonic events in orogenic belts. This work compares the thermochronologic record and erosional behavior of retroarc thrust belts at two latitudes in the Andes with contrasting Cenozoic climate and deformational records: the glaciated southern Patagonian Andes and the semiarid Argentine Precordillera of the Central Andes. Both regions have undergone crustal shortening during Andean growth and have been affected by thermotectonic processes associated with subduction of oceanic ridges; the Chile Ridge spreading center and Juan Fernández Ridge, respectively. In Patagonia, deep erosion occurred during Miocene retroarc deformation. Zircon He thermochronology documents regional cooling and unroofing of the thrust belt ~22-17 Ma. This behavior likely reflects an upper plate manifestation of incipient subduction of the Chile Ridge spreading center and enhanced unroofing during thermally driven regional uplift. Late Cenozoic expansion of the Patagonian icesheet led to further excavation of the thrust belt, indicating a strong climatic overprinting on thrust belt erosional behavior. In contrast, less overall Cenozoic exhumation is observed in the Argentine Precordillera, despite high strain and crustal thickening. Pre-Jurassic zircon He dates from the Paleozoic strata within thrust sheets suggest Cenozoic Andean deformation was insufficient to exhume rocks from beneath the zircon He closure depth. The apatite He record shows a close correlation between thrust faulting and locus of erosion, and document eastward in-sequence rock cooling from 16 to 2 Ma across the Precordillera tracking with the progressive faulting of the Blanca, San Roque, and Niquivil thrust faults during this time. Pliocene apatite He dates located along the external margins of the Precordillera suggest that the most recent cooling and unroofing is associated with both out-of-sequence faulting and deformation in the Eastern Precordillera basement triangle zone during flat slab subduction. Considered together, both sectors of the Andean retroarc domain have undergone complex unroofing histories and exhibit important differences in geologic inheritance, thermotectonic evolution, and climatic regimes.",

Additional analysis of abyssal topography flanking mid-ocean ridges is presented indicating the presence of excess energy near periods corresponding to precession, obliquity, and 100 ky variations. Wavelength is transformed into period using independently estimated spreading rates. This topographic structure is consistent with the expected response of mid-ocean ridge productivity and evolved crustal thickness to changes in pressure associated with variations in sea level. If ridge CO2 emissions track these indications of ridge productivity, decreased emissions as a result of deglaciation are implied, constituting a negative feedback. CO2 emissions would be delayed, however, because of transit times from the base of the melt zone, and a simple delayed oscillator is presented for how delayed negative feedbacks could be important for setting the 100 ky glacial cycle period.",

When the large reservoir size of oceanic crust is considered, carbon transformations in this environment have the potential to significantly impact the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, igneous oceanic crust is the most massive potential habitat for life on Earth, so understanding the carbon sources for this potential biosphere are important for understanding life on Earth. Geochemical evidence suggests that warm and anoxic upper basement is net heterotrophic, but the balance of these processes in cooler and potentially oxic oceanic crust are poorly known. Here, we present data from stable carbon isotope tracer incubations to examine carbon fixation in basalts collected from the Loihi Seamount, the Juan de Fuca Ridge, and the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, to provide a first order constraint on the rates of carbon fixation on basalts. These data will be compared to recently available assessments of carbon cycling rates in fluids from upper basement to synthesize our current state of understanding of the potential for carbon fixation and respiration in oceanic crust. Moreover, we will present new genomic data of carbon fixation genes observed in the basalt enrichments as well as from the subsurface of the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank, enabling identification of the microbes and metabolic pathways involved in carbon fixation in these systems.",

In the Cretaceous Fosdick migmatite–granite complex, P–T phase equilibria modeling of migmatitic paragneisses and orthogneisses, and the occurrence of leucosome-bearing normal-sense shear zones are consistent with suprasolidus conditions in the complex extending into the early stages of doming and exhumation. Sub-horizontal sheeted granites at shallower structural levels and variably oriented granites in networks at deeper structural levels within the complex commonly have coarse blocky plagioclase and/or K-feldspar grains within interstitial quartz, consistent with early crystallization of feldspar. The granites yield U–Pb zircon crystallization ages from 115 to 100 Ma, with a dominant grouping at 107–100 Ma, which corresponds to the timing of dome formation during regional oblique extension that facilitated exhumation of the complex. Whole rock Sr and Nd and zircon Hf and O isotope compositions are consistent with derivation from regionally-associated source materials. Although the major and trace element chemistry of these granites is highly variable, they typically have large positive Eu anomalies and correlated Rb/Sr/Ba covariation, features consistent with the early accumulation of feldspar and quartz and subsequent drainage of fractionated melt. The granites in networks are interpreted to represent clogging of magma transport channels through the middle crust by crystal accumulation as drainage of fractionating magma slowed during doming and exhumation. By contrast, the sheeted granites record collapse of sub-horizontal partially-crystallized layers of magma by filter pressing and drainage of melt during vertical shortening associated with doming. Processes that separate cumulates from evolved melt are likely to have been important in the evolution of granites in other migmatitic gneiss domes. Furthermore, since the evolved melt is expected to have higher concentrations of heat-producing elements, this study has significant implications for the tectonic history of large hot orogens, the cooling of UHT metamorphic terrains and the long-term stability of the continental crust.",

            "abstract": "The conversion of rock to soil through weathering tends to reduce grain size [1] and prepares Earth’s surface for erosion processes to take hold. Warm, wet climatic conditions that lead to the formation of clays and weathering of bedrock clasts to sand might increase the transportability of the particles. For this reason, and potentially others, high weathering rates and high rates of erosion often go hand in hand. Here, we identify a potential process that mechanistically links highly weathered soil profiles with fine-grained particles at the surface – often formed during pre-Quaternary climate regimes – to decreased rates of fluvial incision. When bedrock type allows it, increased weathering in the hinterlands reduces the number and sizes of clasts to efficiently abrade the bed. What impact, then, does this previous climatic state have on the fluvial response times to uplift?\nWe test our ‘Tool-size Effect’ hypothesis in similar-sized tributaries in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory. Here, a series of well-defined knickpoints separate a relict, weathered landscape from a rejuvenated landscape downstream of the knickpoints. Knickpoint initiation results from Early Pliocene tilting of the platform that changed the base level ca. 600 m in <106y. Above the knickpoint, the soils are depleted of easily-weatherable minerals and the sand-bedded streams are graded to the former sea level. We tested the ability of the tool effect to account for different knickpoint propagation rates by ascribing different values of retreat efficiency to each knickpoint based on sediment grain size at each knickpoint lip and cosmogenic nuclide-derived mass fluxes in different grain fractions. We find that grain-size does impact the retreat velocity; the retreat rate with the smallest grain-size at the lip travels ca. half the speed of the stream with the coarsest particles. Knickpoint propagation has been slowing down with time at a rate faster than that predicted by the decrease in upstream drainage area. This mechanism explains the persistence of other high-elevation tropical landscapes with highly weathered soils. It also bears on the response of rivers to climate change and geomorphic hysteresis resulting from time-dependence of weathering processes. [1] Ruxton, B.P.; Berry, L. 1957.

Disturbances to forests occur along a continuum of severity, from low intensity disturbance causing the mortality of only a subset of trees to severe stand-replacing disturbance that kills all trees; yet, considerable uncertainty exists in how and why the forest C cycle changes across gradients of disturbance intensity, and whether ecosystem models robustly simulate these responses.\nAt the University of Michigan Biological Station, we are using multiple ecosystem-scale experiments to examine how disturbance intensity affects C cycling and to identify the underlying mechanisms that support recovery of the C cycle. The Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment (FASET), in which a third of all canopy trees were stem girdled within a 39 ha area, employs C cycling measurements within paired treatment and control meteorological flux tower footprints. A separate study examines forest C cycling following stand-replacing clear-cut harvest and fire.\nWe found that net ecosystem production (NEP) was highly resilient following moderate disturbance, but experienced long-term reductions following stand-replacing disturbance. Using a gradient of disturbance severity within the FASET treatment, we found that forest production declined non-linearly with rising disturbance intensity, remaining stable until a threshold of ~60 % tree mortality was exceeded. NEP was sustained following moderate disturbance because of improved canopy light-use efficiency, which compensated for a temporary reduction in leaf area index. Contrastingly, NEP was reduced for several decades at the highest levels of disturbance severity. A model assessment revealed that neither big-leaf nor gap models captured the observed high resilience in NEP following low intensity disturbance, suggesting inadequate representation of the mechanisms supporting C cycling resilience.",

However, current evidence is mainly derived from high-latitude ecosystems, with little known about high-altitude ecosystems. In this study, we examined permafrost carbon-climate feedback in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau from the following three aspects. First, we evaluated soil carbon stock in the top 3 meter by conducting a large-scale soil survey across the study area during the summer of 2013-2014. We found that Tibetan grassland soils store 10.4 Pg C in the upper 3 meter, ~40% larger than previous estimation in the top 1 meter. Second, we examined large-scale patterns of temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition in alpine ecosystems by conducting laboratory incubation experiments, and found that greater temperature sensitivity occurred in those soils with more recalcitrant components. Third, we explored the responses of carbon cycling processes in alpine grasslands to climate warming by conducting OTC experiments. We found that experimental warming stimulated ecosystem respiration, but also increased gross primary production, and thus led to the net carbon accumulation. Overall, these three lines of evidence demonstrate that carbon cycle in high-altitude ecosystems is very sensitive to climate warming.",

The resulting metamorphic/plutonic basement complex is disrupted by conjugate, mutually cross-cutting sets of brittle, late-orogenic strike-slip faults. Dextral strike-slip faults (separations < 25 km) strike NE-NNE, while conjugate sinistral faults strike SE-SSE, defining a wrench regime (σv = σ2) with horizontal maximum compression, σ1, trending c. 100°. The strike-slip faults are recessive except in dilational sites where upwelling hydrothermal fluids have silicified the cataclastic shear zones (CSZ) which protrude as blade-like ridges extending for kilometres across the semi-arid terrain. The mineralized fault segments include sinuous releasing bends where the fault trace is deflected <10° as well as more abrupt dilational stepovers with distributed extension fracturing linking en echelon fault segments. Other components of structural permeability include: (1) innumerable fault-parallel quartz-veins (cm to m thickness) within the CSZ; (2) irregular stringer veins; and (3) a regional set of predominantly extensional, subvertical planar quartz veins oriented 080-120° at moderate angles to the main faults. Broad contemporaneity is indicated by mutual cross-cutting relationships between all structural components. Measured strike separations along shear fractures are consistent with seismic slip increments which refreshed fracture permeability and promoted hydrothermal flow. Textures suggest the faults were exhumed from epithermal boiling environments (<1-2 km depth). Restoration of fault cohesive strength by hydrothermal cementation was critical in allowing continued vein formation by hydraulic extension fracturing. The distribution of hydrothermal quartz within the fault system provides a guide to structural localization of upflow zones in geothermal fields developed along strike-slip faults.",

            "abstract": "Mountain glaciers show a high sensitivity to changes in climate forcing. In a global perspective, their anticipated retreat will pose far-reaching challenges to the management of fresh water resources and will raise sea levels significantly within only a few decades. Different model frameworks have been applied to simulate melt water contributions of glaciers outside the two ice sheets for the recent IPCC report. However, these models depend on strongly simplified, and often empirical descriptions of the driving processes hampering the reliability of the results. Thus, a transition from the physically-based mass balance-ice flow models developed for single glaciers to the application at the global scale is urgently needed. The challenges are manifold but can be tackled with the new data sets, methods and process-understanding that have emerged during the last years.\nHere, we present a novel glacier model for calculating the response of surface mass balance and 3D glacier geometry for each individual glacier around the globe. Our approach accounts for feedbacks due to glacier retreat and includes models for mass loss due to frontal ablation and refreezing of water in the snow/firn. This allows the calculation of the components of proglacial runoff for each individual glacier in a process-based way. The current surface geometry and thickness distribution for each of the world’s roughly 200’000 glaciers is extracted from the Randolph Glacier Inventory v3.3 and terrain models. Our simulations are driven with 14 Global Circulation Models from the CMIP5 project using the RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios.\nWe focus on the timing of peak water from glacierized catchments in all climatic regions of the earth and the corresponding importance of these regime changes on hydrological stress. Peak water represents a crucial tipping point for sustained water supply even for regions with only a minor glacier coverage, and is relevant to the dynamics of sea level rise. The maximum rate of water release from glacial storage is subject to a high spatio-temporal variability depending on the glacier-specific geometry and its transient response to climatic change.",

            "abstract": "In order to insight into crust-mantle interaction triggered by partial melting of the subudcted continental crust during its exhumation, we carried out a combined study on Shidao alkaline complex in the Sulu ultrahigh pressure (UHP) terrane. The alkaline complex is composed of shoshonitic to ultrapotassic gabbro, pyroxene syenite, amphibole syenite, quartz syenite, and granite. Field researches suggest that the mafic rocks are earlier than the felsic ones in sequence. LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb dating on them gives Late Triassic ages of 214 ± 2 to 200 ± 3 Ma from mafic to felsic rocks. These ages are a bit younger than Late Triassic ages for partial melting of the Sulu UHP terrane during exhumation, indicating syn-exhumation magmatism during continental collision. The alkaline rocks have wide ranges of SiO2 (49.7 – 76.7 wt.%), MgO (8.25 – 0.03 wt.%),total Fe2O3 (9.23 – 0.47 wt.%), CaO (8.39 – 0.39 wt.%), Ni (126.0 – 0.07 ppm), and Cr (182.0 – 0.45 ppm) contents. Other major oxides are regularly changed with SiO2. The alkaline rocks have characteristics of arc-like patterns in the trace element distribution, e.g., enrichment of LREE and LILE (Rb, Ba, Th and U), depletion of HFSE (Nb, Ta, P and Ti), and positive Pb anomalies. From the mafic to felsic rocks, (La/Yb)N ratios and contents of the total REE, Sr and Ba are decreased but Rb contents are increased. The alkaline rocks also display features of A2-type granitoids, suggesting a post-collisional magmatism. They have high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70575 and 0.70927) and negative εNd(t) values (-18.6 to -15.0) for whole-rock. The homogeneous initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios and εNd(t) values of the alkaline rocks are almost unchanged with SiO2 and MgO contents, suggesting a fractional crystallization (FC) process from a same parental magma. Our studies suggest a series of crust-mantle interaction processes along the continental subduction interface as follows: (1) melts from partial melting of the subducted continental crust during its exhumation metasomatized the overlying mantle wedge; (2) partial melting of the enriched lithospheric mantle generated the Late Triassic alkaline complex; and (3) the alkaline magma was successively experienced crystal fractionation mainly dominated by olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and alkali feldspar.",

            "abstract": "The stream power law commonly used to parameterize bedrock incision by mountain channels predicts that rainfall directly controls the rate of erosion and thus landform evolution. We have shown that cyclic variations in rainfall may induce a measurable response from erosional systems that is delayed by a time lag that depends on the forcing period. Here we will generalize this result using a simple landscape evolution model over a wide range of forcing periods to infer the potential erosional response of active tectonic systems to rainfall variability. In particular, we will show that each orogenic system is characterized by a response time scale that can be defined from its height and mean rock uplift rate. When the climate forcing period is much shorter than the response time of the orogenic system, the erosional response is amplified by a factor m, the area exponent in the stream power law, and in phase with the forcing signal (the time lag is nil). To the contrary, when the climate forcing period is longer than the response time of the orogen, the erosional signal is nil. This is what we show in the accompanying diagram where the time lag, θ, (normalized by the forcing period, P) and the gain, G, (relative amplitude of the erosional response normalized by the relative amplitude of the climate forcing) are plotted as a function of the climate forcing period normalized by the response time scale (τ). The time lags are the results of erosional waves propagating upstream at a rate that is independent of channel length, insuring that all rivers in a mountain belt respond in phase with each other and therefore constructively contribute to the overall sedimentary flux. Our work demonstrates that before interrogating the geological record to find evidence for climate control on erosional systems and, a fortiori, on tectonic systems, one needs to carefully consider the period (or the rate) at which the climate has changed. One must also consider that, when that response is measurable, there might exist an important time lag between the climate signal and the erosional response. We will also show how climate variability affects the sediment transport capacity of rivers and the effect this has on the relationship between climate and erosion in active mountain belts.",

            "abstract": "The societal needs for understanding ecosystems response to environmental perturbation have never been greater. Most research on the mechanisms that regulate long-term changes in water quality is based either on individual well-studied catchments, or regional monitoring datasets. While the advantage of research catchments often is the large amount of ancillary information that can provide mechanistic explanations, the results are often difficult to extrapolate because of limited statistical and geographic representation. Conversely, environmental monitoring sites often lack the process-based designed data collection, which instead makes it difficult to infer causal relationships. Here I will discuss the value of field research infrastructures sites that combine the best of long-term monitoring time-series with the exclusivity of process-based research infrastructures across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The basis for this presentation will be on the Krycklan Catchment Study (\nwww.slu.se/Krycklan\n) located in northern Sweden that provides a unique field experimental platform for hillslope to landscape-scale research on long-term ecosystem dynamics in the boreal landscape. The site is designed for processes-based research needed to assess the role of external drivers such as forest management, climate change, and long-range transport of pollutants on forests, mires, soils, streams, lakes and groundwater. In my presentation I will discuss some examples of how Krycklan has succeeded to construct a state-of-the-art field infrastructure for experimental and hypothesis driven research, maintain the long-term climatic, biogeochemical, hydrological and environmental data collection of highest quality, and how this has supported the development of new models and guidelines for research, policy and management.",

            "abstract": "The Late Paleocene epoch marked a substantial change in the tectonic regime of the North Atlantic and the Arctic: after a rapid continental break-up new oceanic crust formed in several basins along the Eurasian, Greenland and North American margins. In the Northeast Atlantic small oceanic basins developed between large land masses, microcontinents and transform faults (like the Norwegian and Greenland basins which were isolated from the Eurasia basin to the north and the Irminger and Iceland basins to the south) that hindered the formation of deep oceanic currents. The most significant change in the tectonic configuration of this region that profoundly modified the oceanic paleocurrent patterns and subsequently the global climate was the (middle) Miocene opening of the Fram Strait.\nHere we present a series of paleobathymetric reconstructions of the North Atlantic and the Arctic using a detailed and updated kinematic model and published sediment thickness information. The kinematic model was constructed based on available geophysical data (mainly magnetic and gravity anomalies) and was combined with thermal subsidence models for calculating the paleodepth of various basins and ridges through time. Our models suggest that the Fram Strait evolved from a narrow strait in early Mid Miocene (ca. 50 km wide and more than 2000 m deep) to a wider and deeper gateway after 10 Ma (about 100 km wide and more than 3500 m deep). The proximity of continental margins and the presence of shallow continental blocks and volcanic plateaus complicated the architecture of this oceanic gateway. The implications of these changes for the formation of deep-water circulation between the North Atlantic and the Arctic regions are discussed and possible paleooceanographic scenarios are proposed.",

            "abstract": "Passive margins are first order strength contrasts between ocean and continents, and they may therefore play a critical role in steering the propagation direction of STEPs. Subduction history potentially is also relevant because it is a decisive factor for the forces that drive continued subduction. In this study we explore these factors with mechanical models.\nResults show that a STEP will follow a passive margin as long as variations in strike remain within 20 degrees. A change in strike of the passive margin ahead of the STEP of less than 15 degrees results in propagation along the passive margin. If the change in strike of the margin is greater than 15 degrees, the STEP will propagate into the direction that it had before reaching the change in margin strike. Surprisingly, subduction history and strength contrast are less relevant.\nThe results shed light on the evolution of the Calabrian arc (central Mediterranean) after the Miocene: slab rollback towards the ESE was facilitated by a roughly W-E oriented STEP that followed the Africa-Ionian passive margin along the north coast of Sicily. The geology of NE Sicily suggests that this passive margin changed orientation here and was parallel to the present-day Sisifo fault. Given that this corresponds to a moderate orientation change, the active STEP continued to follow the margin. The next orientation change of the passive margin, to the one that is bounded by the Malta Escarpment, was approximately 50 degrees. Based on our model results, we therefore predict that the STEP propagated into the Ionian basin in a direction that was approximately parallel to the Sisifo fault. Interestingly, the predicted location of the present-day STEP fault in the basement at the SW termination of the Calabrian trench appears to correspond with a significant discontinuity within the accretionary wedge.",

            "abstract": "Results in recent years have demonstrated that studies of thermospheric dynamics over small or large spatial scales are enhanced when measurements of the wind and temperature fields are obtained as a part of a network of Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI). In contrast to the all-sky FPI design used in the polar region by Conde and colleagues, these FPIs are narrow-field instruments that utilize a SkyScanner to observe in a series of directions over a region 500-800 km in diameter. The sensitivity of these instruments has increased dramatically over older FPIs, allowing new and interesting phenomena to be investigated. When two or more FPIs are utilized, different observing strategies may then offer advantages regarding the ability to study the thermospheric-ionosphere system response over small and large scale sizes that can not be achieved by a single FPI observatory. Examples of results obtained by the North American Thermospheric and Ionospheric Observing Network (NATION), the five FPIs operating in South America, and the three FPIs observing in Alaska will illustrate the system science advantages provided by such networks.",

            "abstract": "Computational thermodynamics (CT) represents a collection of numerical techniques that are used to calculate quantitative results from thermodynamic theory. In the Earth sciences, CT is most often applied to estimate the equilibrium properties of solutions, to calculate phase equilibria from models of the thermodynamic properties of materials, and to approximate irreversible reaction pathways by modeling these as a series of local equilibrium steps. The thermodynamic models that underlie CT calculations relate the energy of a phase to temperature, pressure and composition. These relationships are not intuitive and they are seldom well constrained by experimental data; often, intuition must be applied to generate a robust model that satisfies the expectations of use. As a consequence of this situation, the models and databases the support CT applications in geochemistry and petrology are tedious to maintain as new data and observations arise. What is required to make the process more streamlined and responsive is a computational framework that permits the rapid generation of observable outcomes from the underlying data/model collections, and importantly, the ability to update and re-parameterize the constitutive models through direct manipulation of those outcomes. CT procedures that take models/data to the experiential reference frame of phase equilibria involve function minimization, gradient evaluation, the calculation of implicit lines, curves and surfaces, contour extraction, and other related geometrical measures. All these procedures are the mainstay of image processing analysis. Since the commercial escalation of video game technology, open source image processing libraries have emerged (e.g., VTK) that permit real time manipulation and analysis of images. These tools find immediate application to CT calculations of phase equilibria by permitting rapid calculation and real time feedback between model outcome and the underlying model parameters.",

CT is the basis for the construction of phase diagrams, the application of geothermometers and geobarometers, the equilibrium speciation of solutions, the construction of pseudosections, calculations of mass transfer between minerals, melts and fluids, and, it provides a means of estimating materials properties for the evaluation of constitutive relations in fluid dynamical simulations. The practical application of CT to Earth science problems requires data. Data on the thermochemical properties and the equation of state of relevant materials, and data on the relative stability and partitioning of chemical elements between phases as a function of temperature and pressure. These data must be evaluated and synthesized into a self consistent collection of theoretical models and model parameters that is colloquially known as a thermodynamic database. Quantitative outcomes derived from CT reply on the existence, maintenance and integrity of thermodynamic databases. Unfortunately, the community is reliant on too few such databases, developed by a small number of research groups, and mostly under circumstances where refinement and updates to the database lag behind or are unresponsive to need. Given the increasing level of reliance on CT calculations, what is required is a paradigm shift in the way thermodynamic databases are developed, maintained and disseminated. They must become community resources, with flexible and assessable software interfaces that permit easy modification, while at the same time maintaining theoretical integrity and fidelity to the underlying experimental observations. Advances in computational and data science give us the tools and resources to address this problem, allowing CT results to be obtained at the speed of thought, and permitting geochemical and petrological intuition to play a key role in model development and calibration.",

            "abstract": "Massive hydraulic fracturing is required for commercial gas production from unconventional reservoirs. These reservoirs are often highly fractured and heterogeneous, which may cause significant fracture complexity and also arrest propagation of hydraulic fractures, leading to production decrease. One of the goals of our study was to investigate the influence of rock fabric features on near-wellbore fracture geometry and complexity. We performed a series of laboratory tests on Niobrara outcrop shale blocks with dimensions of 30 x 30 x 36 inches in a true-triaxial loading frame. Acoustic Emission (AE) technique was applied to monitor hydraulic fracture initiation and dynamics of fracture propagation. After the tests, the shape of the created hydraulic fracture was mapped by goniometry technique. To estimate fracture aperture, particles of different sizes were injected with fracturing fluid.\nIn all tests, AE analysis indicated hydraulic fracture initiation prior to breakdown or the maximum of wellbore pressure. In most tests, AE analysis revealed asymmetrical hydraulic fracture shapes. Post-test analysis demonstrated good correspondence of AE results with the actual 3D shape of the fracture surface map. AE analysis confirmed that in some of these tests, the hydraulic fracture approached one face of the block before the maximum wellbore pressure had been reached. We have found that in such cases the propagation of hydraulic fracture in the opposite direction was arrested by the presence of mineralized interfaces. Mapping the distribution of injected particles confirmed the creation of a narrow-width aperture in the vicinity of pre-existing interfaces, restricting fracture conductivity. Based on the results of our study, we concluded that the presence of planes of weakness, such as mineralized natural fractures, can result in the arrest of hydraulic fracture propagation, or in poor fracture geometries with limited aperture, that in turn could lead to high net pressure and low fracture conductivity, restricted proppant delivery, and decreased production.",

            "abstract": "Attempts to link observations across multiple scales, and in particular the problem of scaling up fine-scale observations to landscape and regional process, faces numerous theoretical, computational, and statistical challenges. This talk aims to link theoretical advances in the scaling of biotic heterogeneity, abiotic heterogeneity, and contagious disturbance with statistical advances for linking observations that integrate over different scales. Critical to this goal is the need to partition sources of uncertainty and variability. In particular, the variance you can calculate most readily is rarely the most important or relevant one to quantify. In community ecology, hierarchical Bayes (HB) latent-variable models that separate true variability in ecosystem processes from observation errors have challenged long-standing theory surrounding the maintenance of biodiversity, yet application of such approaches to regional-scale biogeochemical processes is just beginning. A special case of such models, focused on the change of support problem, deal specifically with linking observations that integrate over different spatial and temporal scales.\nOccurring in parallel with these statistical advances have been the development of new theories for the spatially-implicit scaling of biotic and abiotic heterogeneity, as well as contagious disturbances such as fire and pathogens, and the incorporation of such approaches into process-based ecosystem models. Such approaches upscale by integrating the probability distributions of system heterogeneity over the functional response of the ecosystem to such heterogeneity. We demonstrate that this approach can also be downscaled by conditioning on incomplete partial observation at a local scale, and can have lower uncertainty than brute-force spatially-explicit approaches. We also extend such approaches from integrating over observed heterogeneities to integrating the latent, high-dimensional variability in HB models. Finally, there is a pressing need to quantify the important sources and scales of variability and uncertainty in ecosystem processes that affect our ability to forecast ecosystem processes.",

This process constitutes the main mechanism for the differentiation of the continental crust. A recent breakthrough in the study of crustal anatexis is the discovery of former melt inclusions in peritectic minerals of anatectic rocks. These melt droplets show now as glassy inclusions in rapidly cooled anatectic enclaves within volcanic rocks, or as polycrystalline aggregates (nanogranites) in migmatites. Analysis of glassy inclusions and of rehomogenized nanogranites provide direct information on the composition of crustal melts at the source of crustal magmas, on the extent of equilibration between melt and residue, and on the fluid regime during anatexis. A comprehensive geochemical study (≈350 EMP, 100 LA-ICPMS and 80 nanoSIMS analyses) of matrix glasses and glassy melt inclusions in Pl and Grt of anatectic enclaves within El Hoyazo dacite (Betic Cordillera, S Spain), recording melt compositions during regional anatexis at ≈700-850 ºC and 0.5-0.7 GPa, shows that melts are leucogranitic (FeOt+MgO+TiO2=1.0-2.0 wt%), moderately to strongly peraluminous (ASI=1.10-1.25), with H2O concentrations well below saturation (3-5 wt%). They are heterogeneous and spread around the 0.5-0.7 GPa haplogranite H2O-undersaturated eutectics. Glassy inclusions in Pl are more heterogeneous, richer in normative Qtz and H2O, and poorer in FeOt and CaO compared to glassy inclusions in Grt and matrix glass. All glasses have moderate to high concentrations of LILE and low to very low concentrations in FRTE, HFSE and REE. Glass inclusions in Pl and Grt have higher concentrations of LILE, lower concentrations of Y, Zr, REE, and lower values of Th/U compared to matrix glasses. Surprisingly, and in spite of the compositional heterogeneity, glasses are at or close to equilibrium with their residue regarding most of the trace elements, except for some degree of undersaturation in accessory minerals Zrn and Mnz. The compositions of glassy inclusions in Pl and Grt and matrix glasses are interpreted to record the compositional evolution of melt during the prograde melting of the enclaves from ≈700 to 800-850 ºC.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are a central component of Earth system models, and our ability to understand and simulate past, present and future changes in the Earth system is linked to the quality of DGVMs. A major limitation of most DGVMs is that they represent vegetation by a fixed number of static functional types that do not allow plants and plant communities to dynamically adjust to the biotic and abiotic conditions. Here, we present the aDGVM2, a novel individual- and trait-based dynamic vegetation model. The aDGVM2 simulates growth, reproduction and mortality of single plants as a function of the plant-specific combination of trait values. Concepts from genetic optimization are used to simulate trait inheritance, crossover and mutation. These processes ensure that well-performing plants can pass their traits to the next generation and that vegetation can adjust to potentially changing environmental conditions. Thereby, the model iteratively assembles plant communities that are adapted to the environment. The aDGVM2 simulates responses of plant traits along climate, soil and disturbance gradients and associated responses in community structure, diversity and biome types. More specifically, we show that rooting strategies emerging in model simulations are related to soil characteristics and rainfall regimes and that community assembly processes can buffer impacts of disturbances on vegetation. The aDGVM2 model approach integrates aspects of community assembly theory, Earth system modeling and optimality theory and it has a high potential to improve our understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental changes.",

            "abstract": "MESSENGER plasma and magnetic field observations of Mercury’s magnetotail are reviewed and compared to that of Earth. Mercury’s magnetosphere is created by the solar wind interaction with its highly dipolar, spin-axis aligned magnetic field. However, its equatorial magnetic field is ~ 150 times weaker than at Earth. As a result the altitude of its subsolar magnetopause is typically only ~ 1000 km and there is no possibility for trapped radiation belts. Magnetopause reconnection at Mercury does not exhibit the “half-wave rectifier” response to interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction observed at Earth. Rather magnetopause reconnection occurs for all non-zero shear angles with plasma β as the primary parameter controlling its rate. The cross-magnetosphere electric potential drop derived from magnetopause and plasma mantle structure is ~ 30 kV in contrast to ~ 100 kV at Earth. This large potential drop at Mercury relative to its small size appears due to the lack of an electrically conducting ionosphere and the strong IMF found in the inner heliosphere. Structurally these magnetotails are very similar in most respects, but the magnetic field intensities and plasma densities and temperatures are all higher at Mercury. Plasma sheet composition indicates solar wind origin, but with 10% Na+ derived from it tenuous exosphere. Given Mercury's very slow rotation rate, once every 59 Earth days, most sunward plasma sheet convection will impact the nightside of the planet. Magnetic flux loading/unloading in Mercury's tail is similar to that seen at Earth during substorms. However, the duration and amplitude of these cycles are ~ 2 – 3 min and ~ 30 to 50 %, respectively, as compared to ~ 1 - 2 hr and 10 - 25 % at Earth. These episodic, substorm-like events are accompanied by plasmoid ejection and near-tail dipolarization similar what is seen at Earth. Mercury can also exhibit Earth-like steady magnetospheric convection during which plasmoid ejection and dipolarization becomes quasi-periodic. Unlike the Earth, solar wind dynamic pressure increases at Mercury couple directly to its large iron core. Magnetic fields due to induction currents in Mercury's interior strongly resist compression of the dayside magnetosphere. The effects of such inductive coupling on magnetotail dynamics at Mercury remains to be determined.",

            "abstract": "Higher than normal accuracy is required to rigorously observe decadal climate change. But what level is needed? How can this be quantified? This presentation will summarize a new more rigorous and quantitative approach to determining the required accuracy for climate change observations (Wielicki et al., 2013, BAMS). Most current global satellite observations cannot meet this accuracy level. A proposed new satellite mission to resolve this challenge is CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory). CLARREO is designed to achieve advances of a factor of 10 for reflected solar spectra and a factor of 3 to 5 for thermal infrared spectra (Wielicki et al., Oct. 2013 BAMS). The CLARREO spectrometers are designed to serve as SI traceable benchmarks for the Global Satellite Intercalibration System (GSICS) and to greatly improve the utility of a wide range of LEO and GEO infrared and reflected solar passive satellite sensors for climate change observations (e.g. CERES, MODIS, VIIIRS, CrIS, IASI, Landsat, SPOT, etc).\nProviding more accurate decadal change trends can in turn lead to more rapid narrowing of key climate science uncertainties such as cloud feedback and climate sensitivity. A study has been carried out to quantify the economic benefits of such an advance as part of a rigorous and complete climate observing system. The study concludes that the economic value is ~ $12 Trillion U.S. dollars in Net Present Value for a nominal discount rate of 3% (Cooke et al. 2013, J. Env. Sys. Dec.). A brief summary of these two studies and their implications for the future of climate science will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Across the globe, macroclimatic drivers greatly influence coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function. However, changing macroclimatic conditions are rarely incorporated into coastal wetland vulnerability assessments. Here, we quantify the influence of macroclimatic drivers upon coastal wetland ecosystems along the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) coast. From a global perspective, the NGOM coast provides several excellent opportunities to examine the effects of climate change upon coastal wetlands. The abundant coastal wetland ecosystems in the region span two major climatic gradients: (1) a winter temperature gradient that crosses temperate to tropical climatic zones; and (2) a precipitation gradient that crosses humid to semi-arid zones. We present analyses where we used geospatial data (historical climate, hydrology, and coastal wetland coverage) and field data (soil, elevation, and plant community composition and structure) to quantify climate-mediated ecological transitions. We identified winter climate and precipitation-based thresholds that separate mangrove forests from salt marshes and vegetated wetlands from unvegetated wetlands, respectively. We used simple distribution and abundance models to evaluate the potential ecological effects of alternative future climate change scenarios. Our results illustrate and quantify the importance of macroclimatic drivers and indicate that climate change could result in landscape-scale changes in coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function. These macroclimate-mediated ecological changes could affect the supply of some ecosystem goods and services as well as the resilience of these ecosystems to stressors, including accelerated sea level rise. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating macroclimatic drivers within future-focused coastal wetland vulnerability assessments.",

            "abstract": "Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica document a dramatic, step-wise increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) as the Earth warmed during the last deglaciation. Marine sediment archives point towards concurrent millennial-scale shifts in ocean circulation, nutrient cycling, and biological productivity; all of these processes would have been involved in carbon cycle feedbacks. These abrupt events, Heinrich Stadial One (HS1) and the Younger Dryas (YD), are associated in time with large freshwater anomalies and ice-berg rafting in the North Atlantic - which are, in turn, thought to have caused a disruption in the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) through buoyancy forcing, and thus a major perturbation in heat and nutrient transport in the oceans.\nIntermediate waters, formed by a combination of wind-driven mixing and deep winter convection between the Polar and Subantarctic Fronts, represent the upper limb of the MOC that supplies nutrients (albeit relatively depleted in silicic acid compared to other nutrients) to lower latitude thermocline waters. There is widespread evidence throughout the North Atlantic for pulses of diatom productivity during HS1 and YD in regions where there is a low supply of silicic acid today. Were these diatom pulses a result of changes in nutrient supply as a result of a large-scale reorganisation of ocean circulation; changes in the supply rate, extent or relative silicic acid content of the northward flowing upper MOC limb; or do they represent more localised supply processes?\nHere, we investigate changes in intermediate water silicic acid supply using mid- and high-latitude North Atlantic sediment cores and the silicon isotope composition of deep-sea sponge spicules. Together with other proxy records our results, including new high-resolution records from off the south east of Iceland, shed light on the processes that influence silicic acid supply and uptake during periods of abrupt climatic change.",

            "abstract": "The silicon isotope composition of deep-sea sponges has been shown to reflect the concentration of dissolved silicon, silicic acid, in seawater. This discovery has lead to the development of a novel geochemical proxy for past deep water nutrient status, which has already been applied to a wide range of palaeoceanographic questions ranging from Southern Ocean silicic acid leakage on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales, to the proliferation of diatoms at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The initial calibrations based on modern sponge samples showed some scatter in the relationship between sponge silicon isotopes and silicic acid concentration, but without any apparent systematic influence from other environmental factors (temperature, pH, or other nutrients), morphology or species. However, a silicon isotope calibration of core top spicules, based on measurements made on a large number of spicules extracted from sediments, shows a tighter relationship with silicic acid concentrations, indicating that there are variations between and within individuals that are \"averaged out\" during palaeoceanographic studies. As is the case for all novel geochemical proxies, there is a need to test the proxy rigorously to ensure robust interpretation of any downcore signal. Here, we will present new studies of modern sponge specimens that have been carried out to shed light on the processes that could result in differences in silicon isotopic fractionation between and within individual sponges. Our findings highlight where caution is required in order to produce robust downcore records of past ocean silicic acid concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting in subsurface formations, whether for groundwater, storage or oil & gas production, can rely on a wealth of geological information. Currently, most of this information remains underused in both the theory and practice of forecasting based on inverse models which heavily relies on spatial covariances and multi-Gaussian theory. By means of real field studies, I will provide an outline of how such geological information can be accounted through the construction and validation of a large set of training images and the generation of model realizations with MPS (multiple-point geostatistics). Often most critical in solving such inverse problems is the development of prior models that are later used for posterior sampling or stochastic search. I propose therefore a two-stage approach where the first stage consists of a validation of the training image-based prior with the geophysical and flow data. This stage will require only the generation of a few (100s) geological models and the forward modeling of the data response on these models. For geophysical data, the validation consists of comparing histograms of multi-scale wavelet transforms between the forward models and the field data. For flow data, the validation is based on a reduction of dimensionality of the forward response and the data using multi-dimensional scaling. The outcome of this validation is an estimate of the prior probability assigned to each training image, with several training images getting assigned zero probability (incompatible with field data). These prior probabilities are used in the second stage to actually invert for the data using stochastic search. In such stochastic search, I avoid parameterizing the model space and present methods that efficiently perform a direct search in the space of the validated training image-based prior model realizations.",

Yet the mechanisms responsible for the wide range of imaged slab morphologies, either stagnating in the transition zone or penetrating into the lower mantle, remain debated. We use 2-D thermo-mechanical models of a two-plate subduction system, modeled with the finite-element, adaptive-mesh code Fluidity. We implement a temperature- and stress-dependent rheology, and viscosity increases 30-fold from upper to lower mantle. Trench position evolves freely in response to plate dynamics. Such an approach self-consistently captures feedbacks between temperature, density, flow, strength and deformation. Our results indicate that key controls on subduction dynamics and slab morphology are: (i) the evolution of slab strength; and (ii) the slab's ability to induce trench motion. We build a regime diagram that distinguishes four subduction styles: (1) a \"vertical folding\" mode with stationary trench; (2) young slabs that are \"horizontally deflected\" along the 660-km deep viscosity jump ; (3) an inclined slab morphology, resulting from strong trench retreat (old slabs and thinner overriding plates); and (4) a two-stage mode, displaying bent (rolled-over) slabs at the end of upper-mantle descent, that subsequently unbend and achieve inclined morphologies, with late trench retreat (strong overriding plates).\nWe find that the interplay between trench motion and slab deformation at depth dictates the subduction style, both being controlled by slab strength. We show that all seismically observed slab morphologies in the transition zone can arise just by changing the subducting-plate ages. However, to understand present-day slab morphologies, we have to analyse subduction history rather than just current age at the trench.",

Comparisons with IDS contribution to ITRF2008 will address the benefits of including both new DORIS data, and new DORIS missions (e.g. Jason-1, Jason-2, Cryosat-2) in the IDS combination. These comparisons will also emphasize the application of the DORIS ground antennae phase laws in the data processing and the improved modeling of DORIS ground beacon frequency variations.\nIn addition we will present early results of evaluation of ITRF2013 in the context of DORIS processing.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) determines the mechanical and compositional coupling between rigid plates and underlying convecting mantle. Seismological studies reveal distinct reflectors in the uppermost oceanic mantle that are sometimes interpreted as the LAB. These reflectors roughly correlate with the location of vertical gradients in radial seismic anisotropy. However, these proxies for the LAB 1) do not exhibit the depth-age relationship predicted by thermal models and 2) are not detected consistently throughout the major ocean basins. In contrast, gradients in azimuthal anisotropy in oceanic upper mantle do appear to coincide with the predicted thermal structure. This overall seismic signature is suggested to arise both from melt-related processes at mid-ocean ridges and from “freezing in” anisotropy during changes in the direction of plate motion.\nWe test recent interpretations of this upper-mantle seismic structure with measurements of crystallographic textures in experimentally and naturally deformed peridotites. Key observations: 1) Experimental deformation of nominally melt-free olivine aggregates reveals a protracted increase in texture strength and, therefore, in magnitude of elastic anisotropy with progressive deformation, 2) melt-rich systems attain a steady state at very low strain (<~1) with fast seismic directions normal to those in the melt-free case, and 3) textures measured in samples from peridotite massifs exhibit a cm- to m-scale compositional heterogeneity associated with melt production and extraction that could be a significant source of radial anisotropy.\nIn conjunction with constraints on finite strain and melting extent from geodynamic simulations, we use textural observations to predict seismic structure in an oceanic setting. Comparison of our predictions to observed seismic anisotropy provide insight into the role of composition, melting, and rheology in defining the LAB.",

An association between the FAD of T. pedum and a negative carbon isotope excursion has previously been documented in Northwest Canada (Narbonne et al., 1994) and Death Valley (Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000), and since then has been used as an chronostratigraphic marker of the boundary, particularly in siliciclastic poor sections that do not preserve T. pedum.\nHere we present new high-resolution carbon isotope (δ13C ) chemostratigraphy from multiple sections in western Mongolia and the western United States that span the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. High-resolution sampling (0.2-1 m) reveals that instead of one large negative excursion, there are multiple, high-frequency negative excursions with an overall negative trend during the latest Ediacaran. These data help to more precisely calibrate changes in the carbon cycle across the boundary as well as to highlight the potential problem of identifying the boundary with just a few negative δ13C values. We then use a simple carbon isotope box model to explore relationships between phosphorous delivery to the ocean, oxygenation, alkalinity, and turnovers in carbonate secreting organisms.\nCorsetti, F.A., and Hagadorn, J.W., 2000, Precambrian-Cambrian transition: Death Valley, United States: Geology, v. 28, no. 4, p. 299-302.\nNarbonne, G.M., Kaufman, A.J., and Knoll, A.H., 1994, Integrated chemostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Windermere Supergroup, northwestern Canada: Implications for Neoproterozoic correlations and the early evolution of animals: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 106, no. 10, p. 1281-1292.",

First, What are the large-scale forces acting on ejecta as they travel from the Sun to 1 AU through a realistic ambient solar wind, and how does they affect the large-scale structure of the event? Second, what are the dominant waves/shocks associated with fast ICMEs? And third, how are the properties of ICMEs different during cycle 24 than during the previous cycle? To accomplish these objectives, we employ a variety of numerical approaches, including global resistive MHD models that incorporate realistic energy transport processes. We also compare and contrast model results with both remote solar and in-situ measurements of ICMEs at 1 AU and elsewhere, including the so-called ``Bastille Day’’ event of July 14, 2000, and the more recent ``extreme ICME’’ observed by STEREO-A on July 23, 2012.",

            "abstract": "A new, phased-array antenna-steering capability has recently been added to an existing 50-MHz radar on Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, in the central Pacific region. This radar, which we refer to as PAR-50, is capable of scanning in the vertical east-west plane, ±60° about the zenith. The alignment in the magnetic east-west direction allows detection of radar backscatter from small-scale irregularities that develop in the equatorial ionosphere, including those associated with equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs). The coverage, about ±800 km in zonal distance, at an altitude of 500 km, is essentially identical to that provided by ALTAIR, a fully-steerable incoherent-scatter radar, which has been used in a number of studies of EPBs. Unlike ALTAIR, which has only been operated for several hours on a handful of selected nights, the PAR-50 has already been operated continuously, while performing repeated scans, since April 2014. In this presentation, we describe the PAR-50, then, compare it to ALTAIR and the Equatorial Atmospheric Radar (EAR); the latter is the only other phased-array system in use for equatorial studies. We then assess what we have learned about EPBs from backscatter radar measurements, and discuss how the PAR-50 can provide a fresh perspective to our understanding. Clearly, the ability to sort out the space-time ambiguities in EPB development from sequences of spatial maps of EPBs is crucial to our understanding of how EPBs develop.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in atmospheric sciences is predicting heterogeneous ice nucleation, where one out of one million ambient aerosol particles induces ice crystal formation resulting in mixed-phase and cirrus clouds. A novel multi-modal methodology is presented that allows optical and micro-spectroscopic imaging of individual identified field-collected ice nuclei (IN) active in immersion freezing and deposition ice nucleation. The identified IN from an ambient aerosol population sampled in central California dominated by urban and marine aerosols belong to the most common particle types: organic coated sea salt, and Na-rich, secondary, and refractory carbonaceous particles. Based on these observations, the IN represent not particles with unique chemical composition and exceptional ice nucleation propensity; rather, they are common particles in the ambient particle population. The results suggest that particle-type abundance and surface area, together with particle-type ice nucleation efficiency, is crucial for determining ice formation within the particle population. Complementary to our findings, we introduce a new stochastic and time-dependent immersion freezing simulation able to reproduce a wide range of laboratory data in which all particles in an aerosol population are treated explicitly as IN accounting for variable surface area. Of particular interest is the impact of the uncertainty of particle surface area on interpretation of laboratory and field derived ice nucleation data. The model simulation and experimental results corroborate classical nucleation theory with important consequences for cloud modeling studies and field measurement strategies.",

All of these contribute to dramatic differences in the quality and quantity of climate education received by U.S. students.

Two cases of particular relevance include the so-called injection problem at shock waves. In particular, the question of how particles are injected into the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism at a perpendicular shock can be addressed on the basis of a kappa distribution. We discuss briefly the possible formation of a kappa distribution at a shock and show how this is then accelerated at a quasi-perpendicular shock. These results are related to observed energetic particle spectra downstream of an interplanetary shock. The reverse question at the heliospheric termination shock is discussed viz., what form does the pickup ion distribution downstream of the heliospheric termination shock assume? We show that this closely resembles a kappa distribution. We illustrate the importance of using a kappa distribution in the context of large-scale simulations of the solar wind – local interstellar medium interaction.",

            "abstract": "Drastic reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the most obvious way to stabilize atmospheric CO2. However, there is growing risk that effective emissions reduction policies and technologies will not engage soon enough to avoid significant CO2-induced climate and ocean acidification impacts. This realization has lead to increased interest (e.g., IPCC AR5, 2014; NRC/NAS, 2014) in the possibility of pro-actively increasing CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere above the 55% of our emissions that are already removed from air by natural land and ocean processes. While a variety of biotic, abiotic, and hybrid CDR methods have been proposed, those involving geochemistry have much to recommend them. These methods employ the same geochemical reactions that naturally and effectively remove excess planetary CO2 and neutralize ocean acidity on geologic time scales. These reactions proceed when the hydrosphere, acidified by excess air CO2, contacts and reacts with carbonate and silicate minerals (>90% of the Earth’s crust), producing dissolved bicarbonates and carbonates, i.e., ocean alkalinity. This alkalinity is eventually removed and the excess carbon stored via carbonate precipitation. So while the importance and global effectiveness of such reactions are not in question, it remains to be seen if this very slow, natural CDR could be safely and cost-effectively accelerated to help manage air CO2 levels on human rather than geologic time scales. Various terrestrial and marine, geochemistry-based CDR methods will be reviewed including: 1) the addition of minerals to soils and the ocean, 2) removal of CO2 from waste streams, esp. from biomass energy, via wet mineral contacting, and 3) the production and use of mineral derivatives, e.g. oxides or hydroxides, as CDR agents. The additional potential environmental benefits (e.g., reversal of ocean carbonate saturation loss) and impacts (e.g., increased mineral extraction), as well as potential economics will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "50 years ago, Gast, Tilton and Hedge demonstrated that the oceanic mantle is isotopically heterogeneous. 28 years ago, Zindler and Hart formalized the concept of geochemical mantle components, with an attendant, to some, odious, acronym soup. Work on a marriage of mantle geochemistry and dynamics continues unabated. We know unequivocally that the mantle is chemically heterogeneous; we do not know the scale lengths of these heterogeneities. We know unequivocally that these heterogeneities have persisted for eons (Gy); we do not know where they were formed or where they are stored. Through the kind auspices of the Plume Model, we plausibly have access to the whole mantle.\nThe most accessible and well understood mantle reservoir is the upper depleted MORB mantle (DMM). Classically, this mantle was depleted by extraction of oceanic and continental crust from a “chondritic” bulk silicate Earth. In this post-Boyet and Carlson world, the complementary enriched reservoir may instead be hidden in the deepest mantle. In this case, DMM will become an endangered acronym.\nHofmann and White (1982) argued that radiogenic Pb mantle (HIMU) is re-cycled ocean crust, and this is a comfortably viable model. It does require some ad hoc chemical manipulations during subduction. Given 2 Gy of aggregate mantle strains, the mafic component in HIMU may be of small length scale (< 50 m), possibly subsumed into the dominant peridotitic lithology. This mantle species is globally widespread.\nEnriched mantles (EM1 and EM2) almost certainly reflect recycling of enriched continental material. This was splendidly verified by Jackson et al (2007), with 87Sr/86Sr in Samoan EM2 lavas up to 0.721. The lithology and length scale of EM1 and EM2 is unconstrained. EM1 is globally present; EM2 is confined to the SW Pacific hotspots.\nFOZO is a work in progress; many would like to see it become extinct!\nThe trace element signatures of HIMU and FOZO mantles have been constrained using melting models; in both cases the spidergrams are “enriched” with peaks at Nb-Ta of 2x and 4x bulk silicate earth, respectively, but with quite different shapes. As is typical with OIB, the derived source compositions are incompatible with the isotopic signatures, requiring a fairly recent “enrichment” event (possibly auto-metasomatism).",

            "abstract": "River modeling is the processing of setting up a physically-based hydrodynamic model that can simulate the water flow dynamics of a stream network against time varying boundary conditions. Such river models are an important component of any flood forecasting system that forecasts river levels in flood prone regions. However, many large river basins in the developing world such as the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna (GBM), Indus, Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong and Niger are mostly ungauged. Such large basins lack the necessary in-situ measurements of river bed depth/slope, bathymetry (river cross section), floodplain mapping and boundary condition flows for forcing a river model. For such basins, proxy approaches relying mostly on remote sensing data from space platforms are the only alternative. In this study, we share our experience of setting up the widely-used 1-D river model over the entire GBM basin and its stream network. Good quality in-situ measurements of river hydraulics (cross section, slope, flow) was available only for the downstream and flood prone region of the basin, which comprises only 7% of the basin area. For the remaining 93% of the basin area, we resorted to the use of data from the following satellite sensors to build a workable river model: a) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for deriving bed slope; b) LANDSAT/MODIS for updating river network and flow direction generated by elevation data; c) radar altimetry data to build depth versus width relationship at river locations; d) satellite precipitation based hydrologic modeling of lateral flows into main stem rivers. In addition, we referred to an extensive body of literature to estimate the prevailing baseline hydraulics of rivers in the ungauged region. We measured success of our approach by systematically testing how well the basin-wide river model could simulate river level dynamics at two measured locations inside Bangladesh. Our experience of river modeling was replete with numerous hurdles that we did not anticipate, and often required a change in plan. In this study we summarize these key hurdles faced and offer a step by step approach to setting up river models for large ungauged river basins. Such a guide can be useful for the community wishing to set up RAS type models in basins such as Niger, Mekong, Irrawaddy, Indus etc.",

We present and compare fault framework models from the Hayward-Calaveras, Calaveras-San Andreas, and Hosgri-Shoreline fault intersections and discuss the importance of ultramafic ophiolitic rocks and the implications for seismic hazard. Fault framework models were created based on integrated analysis of geology, potential-field, seismic-reflection, multibeam bathymetry, and seismicity data. In each case, ultramafic ophiolitic rocks have very limited surface expression, but are prevalent in the subsurface from ~1 to ~8 km depth. High-resolution aero- and marine-magnetic data are particularly important for determining the geometry of these strongly magnetic rock bodies and the faults along which they occur. At each fault intersection, the ultramafic ophiolitic rocks characterize a pre-existing structure that either promotes or represents a barrier to faulting, and significantly influences local deformation patterns. Although the faults at each intersection do not connect directly at the surface, combined geologic and geophysical data suggest that these faults connect in the subsurface either along a single through-going fault plane or along multiple splay faults. The continuity of these fault intersections at seismogenic depths suggests the possibility of a combined rupture that should be evaluated in future seismic hazard studies.",

The core is gravity one (St#822), 4.5 m long, and in 1089 m water depth. The study of benthic and planktic foraminifera is used to determine the microhabitat of the bottom sediments during warm and cold periods. Sapropels S1, S3 and S4 are encountered in the studied gravity core sample from the eastern Mediterranean. The sapropel layers S1, S3 and S4 were deposited during interglacial periods, characterized by a low foraminiferal numbers, reflecting eutrophic conditions. Glacial periods are characterized by high foraminiferal numbers due probably to an enhanced glacial productivity. Sapropel layers are distinguished by increase of Fe, TOC% (TOC%≥ 1.2%) and decrease of Ca concentrations as a result of the Blue Nile suspended particulate matter discharge during summer monsoon. Clay content increases at the sapropel depths that indicate an increase in the terrigenous input derived from the weathering of Ethiopian basalts. Temporal distribution of planktic and benthic foraminifera in the Nile deep sea fan sediments besides geochemical charcterization, palaeohydrological fluctuations, palaeoenvironment and microhabitat of foraminifera were reconstructed for the last 100000 years including glacial and interglacial periods. Formation of the Sapropel layers are synchronized with the decreasing of δ18O which means that the Mediterranean Sea received high amount of fresh water from the Nile river discharge. Clay content, TOC%, Ca–Fe cycles, oxygen and carbon isotopes and planktic foraminifera document the pluvial and arid periods throughout the 100000 years and define clearly the contributions of terrigenous and TOC% in the sapropel layers. Infauna/epifauna ratio and benthic foraminifera assemblages were used to reconstruct the microhabitat of the sea bottom during sapropel and cold periods.",

            "abstract": "With their unique orbit, the Van Allen Probes (RBSP) spacecraft are well suited to investigate near-Earth substorm injections that penetrate into the heart of outer radiation belts. Substorms are generally conceived to inject 10s-100s keV electrons but intense substorm electric fields have been shown capable of injecting ~MeV electrons as well at the geosynchronous altitude. An intriguing question is whether such MeV electron injections can penetrate to lower L shells and directly contribute to the relativistic electron population of the outer radiation belt. In this talk, we present RBSP observations of near-Earth substorm injection of MeV relativistic particles and associated intense dipolarization electric field at L ~5.5. The substorm injection occurred during a moderate storm (DST~-30 to -20) with steady solar wind conditions. RBSP-A observed dispersionless injection of electrons from 10s keV up to 3 MeV in the pre-mid night sector (MLT=22UT). The injection was associated with unusually large (60mV/m) dipolarization electric fields that lasted 1 minute. At about the same time, THEMIS-D observed energy-dispersive injection of electrons at energies as high as at least 720keV at L~6.8 in the pre-dawn sector. Injection of energetic protons (~1MeV) and proton drift echos were observed at RBSP-A as well. RBSP-A observed a broad spectrum of nonlinear electric field structures but no whistler waves at the injection. The properties of the observed dipolarization electric field constrain the acceleration mechanism responsible for the MeV electron injection. We will discuss the implications of these observations on the direct impact of substorms on the outer radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the time-lagged impacts of the spring sensible heat (SH) source over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) on summer rainfall anomaly in east China by using the WRF model. Numerical experiments for the 2003 case indicates that spring SH anomaly over the TP can maintains its impact until summer and leads to the overall strong atmospheric heat source, which is characterized by the enhanced both SH over the western TP and condensation latent heat to the east. The wave activity diagnosis revealed that the enhanced TP heating forces a Rossby wave train to the downstream regions. The cyclonic response to the northeast TP brings about the low level northerly anomaly over the northern China, while the anticyclonic response over the western Pacific enhances the subtropical high and the low level southerly in its western flank. As a result, cold and dry airflows from mid-high latitudes and warm and wet airflows from tropical oceans converge around the Huaihe River basin. In addition, warm advection originated from the TP induces vigorous ascending motion over the convergence belt. With such a favourable circulation condition, the eastward propagating vortexes initiated over the TP intensify the torrential rainfall processes over the Huaihe River basin. Another case study of 2001 with weak spring SH over the TP and the overall southward retreat of summer rainfall belt in east China further demonstrates the role of spring SH over the TP in regulating the interannual variability of EASM in terms of wave activity and synoptic disturbance.",

However, investigating groundwater trends and groundwater-surface water linkages is extremely challenging in a data-scarce environment where basins are largely ungauged so there is very little historical data; often the data are missing, flawed or biased. Moreover, hard-rock aquifer data are very difficult to interpret.\nIn the absence of reliable data, establishing a trend let alone the causal linkages is a severe challenge. We used a combination of low-cost, participatory, satellite based and conventional data collection methods to maximize spatial and temporal coverage of data.\nFor instance, long-term groundwater trends are biased because only a few dug wells with non-representative geological conditions still have water - the vast majority of the monitoring wells drilled in the 1970s and 1980s have dried up. Instead, we relied on “barefoot hydrology” techniques. By conducting a comprehensive well census, engaging farmers in participatory groundwater monitoring and using locally available commercial borewell scanning techniques we have been able to better establish groundwater trends and spatial patterns.",

OBS1 uses a sequence of adiabatic melting with pyroxenite melting, melt metasomatism in the host peridotite, and melting of the metasomatized peridotite. OBS1 explores (1) the fractions of peridotite and pyroxenite, (2) mantle potential temperature Tp, (3) depth of termination of melting Pmt, (4) degree of melting F, and (5) residual mode Xa of the sources. The model also examines the mass balance of 26 incompatible trace elements in the sources and in the generated basalt. OBS1 can also calculate Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotope compositions in the sources and in the melt. OBS1 is coded in an Excel spreadsheet and runs with VBA macros. Using OBS1, we examine the source conditions of the mid oceanic ridge basalts (MORBs), plume-influenced ocean ridge basalts in Galápagos, Loihi–Loa–Koolau basalts in the Hawaiian hotspot, high-mu (HIMU) basalt from the St. Helena hotspot, and Shatsky Rise and Jurassic Mikabu oceanic plateau basalts and picrites.

Slip is initiated when contacts are broken via propagating ruptures. Characterization of the dynamic fields that drive these ruptures and how they couple to the dissipative mechanisms on the interface are critical to our fundamental understanding of both frictional motion and earthquake dynamics.\nWe experimentally investigate ruptures along rough spatially extended interfaces bounded by the same type of material. We perform simultaneous high-speed measurements (at μsec time scale) of the real contact area and the strain fields in the region surrounding propagating rupture tips. These measurements enable us to uncover the breakdown process near the tip of the slipping zone for rapidly propagating ruptures ranging from slow rupture fronts (~0.01CR) to nearly the Rayleigh wave speed, CR~1255m/s.\nThese rupture fronts are quantitatively described by classical singular solutions for rapid shear cracks. These singular solutions, originally derived to describe brittle fracture, are in excellent agreement with the experiments for slow propagation, whereas some significant discrepancies arise as the rupture velocity approaches CR. The energy dissipated by the fracture of the contacts (fracture energy) is nearly constant throughout the entire rupture velocity range, while the size of the dissipative zone undergoes a ‘Lorentz-like’ contraction as the rupture velocity approaches CR.\nWe then turn to both fully lubricated and partially lubricated interfaces and compare the dynamic strain fields measured to those of dry interfaces. The results of these studies are surprising.\nWe will show that:\nRapid rupture fronts still propagate in the stick-slip regime\nAlthough decreasing the overall friction coefficient along the interface, the addition of a lubricant significantly increases the fracture energy at the rupture tip\nIn the fully lubricated case, the form of the fields surrounding the rupture tip may belong to a different class of solutions than the classical solutions given by dynamic shear fracture.\nThis coupling between friction and fracture is critical to our fundamental understanding of frictional motion and related processes, such as earthquake dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The seismoelectric method is based on the interpretation of the electrical field associated with the conversion of mechanical to electromagnetic energy during the propagation of seismic waves in heterogeneous porous media. We propose a poroacoustic model. This model takes into account fluid flow and the effect of the partial saturation of the water phase and is coupled with an electrokinetic model accounting for the effect of saturation. The model is in agreement with available experimental data in a variety of porous media. We also developed new scaling laws for the permeability, the streaming potential coupling coefficient, and the capillary entry pressure of porous media. The theory is developed for frequencies much below the critical frequency at which inertial effects starts to dominate in the Navier-Stokes equation (>10 kHz). The equations used to compute the propagation of the P-waves and the seismoelectric effect in unsaturated condition are solved with finite elements using triangular meshing. A first example demonstrates the usefulness of the seismoelectric beamforming, to localize saturation fronts by focusing seismic waves and looking at the resulting seismoelectric conversions. This method is applied to a cross-hole problem showing how a saturation front characterized by a drop in the electrical conductivity and compressibility is responsible for seismoelectric conversions. These conversions can be used in turn to determine the position of the front over time. The figure shows the dipolar anomaly resulting from the beamforming of seimiec energy at point A and associated with a resistivity contrast. Finally, we show how a complete two-phase flow seismoelectric theory can be developed based on the extension of the dynamic Biot theory to two-phase flow conditions and how this theory can be numerically implemented.",

            "abstract": "The island nation of Sri Lanka is divided into two agro-climatic zones: the southwestern wet zone and the northeastern dry zone. The dry zone is exposed to drought-like conditions for several months each year. Due to the sporadic nature of rainfall, dry zone livelihoods depend on the successful storage, capture, and distribution of water. Traditionally, water has been captured in rain-fed tanks and distributed through a system of dug canals. Recently, the Sri Lankan government has diverted the waters of the nation’s largest river through a system of centrally managed reservoirs and canals and resettled farmers to cultivate this newly irrigated land. This study uses remotely sensed MODIS and LANDSAT imagery to compare vegetation health and cropping patterns in these distinct water management regimes under different conditions of water scarcity. Of particular interest are the socioeconomic, infrastructural, and institutional factors that affect cropping patterns, including field position, water storage capacity, and control of water resources. Results suggest that under known conditions of water scarcity, farmers cultivate other field crops in lieu of paddy. Cultivation changes depend to a large extent on the institutional distance between water users and water managers as well as the fragmentation of water resources within the system.",

            "abstract": "TEX86, an organic palaeothermometer based upon the distribution of isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in marine Thaumarchaeota, is regularly used to reconstruct spatial and temporal sea surface temperature patterns, especially in older (Mesozoic and Palaeogene) settings. The TEX86 proxy assumes that Thaumarchaeota in modern oceans are representative of those living in ancient settings, but even in today’s oceans Thaumarchaeotal phylogeny is diverse. In the Red Sea, phylogenetically distinct archaeal communities occur both above and below the thermocline and correspond to core-top sediments in which TEX86 values consistently overestimate satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) by 6-8°C [1]. These elevated SSTs are associated with an unusual GDGT distribution characterised by low GDGT-0 (<10%) and high GDGT-4’ (>10%). Here we propose the %GDGTRS index (= ([GDGT-4’]/[GDGT-4’]+[GDGT-0])*100) as a way to identify Red Sea-type GDGT distributions in ancient sediments.\nIn a Paleogene (65-34Ma) compilation, Red Sea-type GDGT distributions are common and geographically widespread, and could lead to SST overestimates. The underlying ecological controls that govern the occurrence of these distributions remain unclear, but they are especially common during times of elevated warmth (i.e. EECO, PETM). During the EECO and the PETM, the occurrence of Red Sea-type GDGT distributions coincides with the presence of hypersaline and/or lagoonal dinocysts in at least four global localities. We suggest that the high %GDGTRS values during these very hot intervals reflect the presence of unique Thaumarchaeotal or Euryarchaeotal clusters responding to the development of more saline conditions, similar to or perhaps exceeding those observed in the Red Sea today.\n1.

In cold climates, freeze/thaw cycles and short growing seasons can enhance soil N2O production contributing to the temporal variability of fluxes. Year-round measurements of N2O fluxes in multiple cropping systems are needed to decrease the uncertainty of annual emission estimates and to devise mitigation practices for emission reduction in cold climates. We have deployed a micrometeorological flux-gradient approach coupled to a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy system at two long-term sites in Canada: Elora, Ontario (2000-2014) and Glenlea, Manitoba (2006-2014). Quasi-simultaneous half-hourly flux measurements on four 4-ha fields within a level and aerodynamically homogeneous landscape were obtained allowing for comparison of crop type and/or management practices within and between years. Annual crops such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley received typical inorganic fertilizer and/or manure applications, and best management practices such as timing of application and reduced tillage were studied. Perennial grass-alfalfa hayfields were compared to annual crops during selected time periods. Here we synthesize the long-term datasets from these two sites, and quantify the overall contribution of non-growing season (mainly freeze/thaw cycles) and growing season (mainly nitrogen application) to annual emission totals. Uncertainties of regional estimates for cold-climates will be assessed using these long-term datasets.",

            "abstract": "One of the primary goals of paleo-sea level research is to assess the stability of ice sheets and glaciers in warming climates. In this context, the 20th century may be thought of as the most recent, recorded, and studied of all past episodes of warming. Over the past decade, a consensus has emerged in the literature that 20th century global mean sea level (GMSL), inferred from tide gauge records, rose at a mean rate of 1.6-1.9 mm/yr. This sea-level rise can be attributed to multiple sources, including thermal expansion of the oceans, ice sheet and glacier mass flux, and anthropogenic changes in land water storage. The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC summarized the estimated contributions of these sources over 1901-1990 and computed a total rate, using a bottom-up approach, of ~1.0 mm/yr, which falls significantly short of the rate inferred from tide gauge records. Using two independent probabilistic approaches that utilize models of glacial isostatic adjustment, ocean dynamics, and the sea-level fingerprints of rapid land-ice melt to analyze tide gauge records (Kalman smoothing and Gaussian process regression), we are able to close the 20th century sea-level budget and resolve the above enigma. Our revised estimate for the rate of GMSL rise during 1901-1990 is 1.1–1.3 mm/yr (90% credible interval). This value, which is ~20-30% less than previous estimates, suggests that the change in the GMSL rate from the 20th century to the last two decades (2.7 ± 0.4 mm/yr, consistent with past estimates) was greater than previous estimates. Moreover, since some forward projections of GMSL change into the next century are based in part on past estimates of GMSL change, our revised rate may impact projections of GMSL rise for the 21st century and beyond.",

On the outer slope, most calderas display radial fissures and, in limited cases, also circumferential fissures. Despite many hypotheses, the conditions controlling the formation of radial and/or circumferential fissures, and thus the shallow magma transfer within the volcano slopes, are still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate with numerical and analog models that the mass redistribution associated with caldera formation promotes shallow sill-shaped magma chambers and controls the orientation of eruptive fissures. We find that depending on the initial injection depth, dikes will bend or twist about an axis parallel to propagation resulting in circumferential and radial eruptive fissures, respectively. This mechanism is governed by the competition between gravitational unloading pressure and dike overpressure. We apply our results to Fernandina (Galapagos, Ecuador), the best case of caldera with radial and circumferential fissures, showing that the predicted stress field caused by the caldera unloading is consistent with the pattern of eruptive fissures and the dynamics of magma propagation.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) model is a real-time, global, physics-based model for predicting exposure to cosmic radiation to air travelers from both galactic and solar sources. Tabular and graphical data products from the prototype operational NAIRAS model have been available to the public since April 2011. An initial validation of the NAIRAS model was recently conducted by comparing predicted dose rates with tabulated reference aircraft measurement data and recent aircraft radiation measurements taken in 2008. However, aircraft measurements alone do not provide an unambiguous constraint on the model such that the predominant source of uncertainty in the NAIRAS model could be uniquely identified. High altitude measurements above the Pfotzer maximum are needed to characterize the extent to which the NAIRAS model can predict the cosmic radiation primaries, which are the source of the secondary particles that are responsible for radiation exposure at aircraft flight altitudes. The Radiation Dosimetry Experiment (RaD-X) is a NASA high-altitude balloon flight mission with the goal of improving model characterization of cosmic radiation primaries by taking dosimetric measurements above the Pfotzer maximum. A second goal of the RaD-X mission is to facilitate the pathway toward data assimilative predictions of atmospheric cosmic radiation exposure by identifying and characterizing low-cost radiation measurement solutions. RaD-X is scheduled for launch at Fort Sumner, NM in September 2015. Here we briefly describe the NAIRAS model, present the science and mission overview of the RaD-X mission, and show preliminary results from instrument beam tests and calibration.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties in aerosol distributions, properties, and processes allow for a wide diversity of aerosol representations in global models, which complicates the attribution of simulated climate change, for example, to specific forcing agents. A component of model diversity results from fundamental unknowns in critical aerosol parameters, such as optical properties. Other components of model diversity, however, arise from structural considerations of the models themselves, for instance, spatial resolution and basic model physics. We investigate these sources of diversity using different instances of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) Earth system model. GEOS-5 runs the Goddard Chemistry, Aerosol, Radiation, and Transport (GOCART) aerosol module online and radiatively coupled within its atmospheric general circulation model. Three specific structural considerations are addressed: horizontal spatial resolution, meteorology, and model physics. For all cases the GOCART aerosol module is held fixed. Results of the different simulations are intercompared and evaluated in the context of aerosol remote sensing observations from MODIS, MISR, AERONET, and CALIOP. Spatial resolution is considered by running the system at grid resolutions varying from about 2º (typical of climate simulations) to 0.25º (typical of global weather forecasting systems). Meteorology is considered by driving the model with either internally generated winds or else by replaying from the MERRA meteorological reanalysis. Model physics is considered by testing two versions of the GEOS-5 system. For all cases we consider the resulting diversity among the simulated aerosol distributions and properties, in comparison with observations, as well as the impact on computed aerosol radiative fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Plasma transport and energization of ions in the magnetotail has been shown to largely occur in the form of injections of hot plasma, localized in MLT, associated with bursty bulk flows and sharp dipolarizations of the magnetic field. However, the relationship of these transient tail phenomena to energetic particle injections into the inner magnetosphere is not well understood. Recent results by the RBSPICE instrument of the Van Allen Probes mission showed that the occurrence of energetic ion injections inside geosynchronous orbit can be very frequent throughout the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, and indicated that the contribution of such injections to the ring current buildup could be substantial. Understanding the formation and evolution of energetic ion injections in the inner magnetosphere and their relationship to transient phenomena in the tail is, therefore, of great importance. In order to differentiate between temporal and spatial variations, it is essential to investigate injections via multi-point observations. We study a substorm event that occurred during a small storm (Dst ~-40 nT), where two injections of energetic ions (50 – 300 keV), 10 minutes apart, were observed by RBSPICE instrument inside geosynchronous orbit, and six LANL and two GOES spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit. Geosynchronous spacecraft ETS-8, at a similar MLT with Van Allen Probe B, also observed the dipolarization signatures associated with these two injections. At the same time, two THEMIS spacecraft were monitoring the night-side magnetosphere at ~ 10 RE. Using ground-based magnetometer data, we are able to identify the eastward and westward edges of the current wedge associated with each one of these injections. The two injections, as observed in the inner magnetosphere, exhibit distinct differences in their dipolarization signatures as well as their duration. With all the above data at hand, we investigate the inward propagation of the injections into the inner magnetosphere, their MLT extent, their duration, as well as their relationship to activity farther down the magnetotail, in order to address the causes of the differences in the injection signatures.",

            "abstract": "During periods of fast plate motion (e.g. Cambrian, Jurassic), plate velocities in excess of ~20 cm/yr (200 km/Myr) relative to the Earth’s spin axis have been suggested. Pinning down the position of fast moving plates requires paleomagnetic poles (paleopoles) with age resolution of a few million years. Modern generations of apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) are becoming increasingly sophisticated in handling ever-growing volumes of data, usually by applying moving windows (e.g., 10 Myr) to the available paleopoles. Averaging paleopoles of fast moving plates may however result in loss of resolution whereby abrupt (but real) changes in APWP may appear subdued when a multimillion-year moving window is applied. Episodes of fast motion are better captured by using paleopoles with best age resolution (coupled with good structural control and provided with inclination flattening estimates) grouped within discrete and independent time windows. Best age control is attained when paleopoles are retrieved from laterally reproducible magnetostratigraphic sections calibrated with biostratigraphy and/or radiometric dating and correlated with reference timescales.\nThis approach was recently applied to the construction of the Adria-Africa APWP (Muttoni et al. 2013). Paleopoles from parautochthonous regions of Adria and obtained either from biostratigraphically dated sedimentary rocks, corrected for inclination shallowing, or from radiometrically dated igneous rocks that are regarded as free from inclination shallowing, were compared with coeval, and inclination flattening-free, paleopoles from stable Africa. The resulting composite APWP shows a remarkable agreement with the Kent and Irving (2010) APWP, and displays a rapid polar shift of ~40° during the Jurassic that other APWPs tend to underestimate. This Jurassic monster shift is also predicted for Eurasia. Paleomagnetic data from the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Garedu Formation of Iran, which was part of Eurasia since the Triassic, indicate a paleolatitude of deposition that is in excellent agreement with the latitude drop predicted by the monster shift (Mattei et al. 2014), which stands as a major and generalized plate motion event of vast and as yet unexplored paleogeographic implications.

            "abstract": "The timing of India-Asia collision is critical to the understanding of crustal deformation processes. In the NW Himalaya, a number of workers have proposed a ~55-50 Ma age for collision along the Indus suture zone which separates India from the Kohistan-Ladakh Intraoceanic Island arc (KLA) to the north. This is based on a number of factors including the age of youngest marine sediments in the suture (\ne.g. Green et al. 2008\n), age of eclogites indicative of onset of Indian continental subduction (\ne.g. de Sigoyer et al. 2000\n), and first evidence of detritus from north of the suture zone deposited on the Indian plate (\ne.g. Clift et al. 2002\n). Such evidence can be interpreted as documenting the age of India-Asia collision if one takes the KLA to have collided with the Asian plate prior to its collision with India (\ne.g. Petterson 2010 and refs therein\n). However, an increasing number of workers propose that the KLA collided with Asia subsequent to its earlier collision with India, dated variously at 85 Ma (\nChatterjee et al. 2013\n), 61 Ma (\nKhan et al. 2009\n) and 50 Ma (\nBouilhol et al. 2013\n). If correct, then the previous constraints to dating the collision as outlined above have in fact been dating the timing of India-arc collision, rather than the final ocean closure and terminal collision of India+arc with Asia as previously believed. This, plus the questioning of earlier provenance work of Clift et al. (\n2002\n) regarding the validity of their data for constraining the time when detritus from north of the suture first arrived on the Indian plate (\nHenderson et al. 2011\n) suggests that the time is right for a reappraisal of this topic. But which method to use? A provenance study now brings with it a requirement to distinguish between detritus from the KLA and Southern margin of Asia. Recently, Bouilhol et al (\n2013\n) undertook a detailed study of the KLA, using temporal and spatial variation of zircon U-Pb and Hf as well as Sr-Nd bulk analyses, to document the arc’s collision with India at 50 Ma and its subsequent collision with Asia at 40 Ma. Such variation should be reflected in the detrital record of material eroded from the arc. We use zircon U-Pb and Hf analyses from Palaeogene sediments deposited in and adjacent to the Indus suture in Ladakh, to further explore the interpretations presented in that research.",

Droughts, in particular, can add significant stress to the water and energy systems by reducing water supply that constrains not only water use but also energy production. During the 2012 summer drought in the Central Great Plains, the most severe seasonal drought in 117 years, precipitation was almost two standard deviations below normal east of the Continental Divide to the Ohio Valley, with coincident much above normal temperature and low surface runoff. The Platform for Regional Integrated Modeling and Analysis (PRIMA), an integrated framework designed to address water-energy nexus, is being tested in its ability to simulate the meteorological and hydrological conditions of the 2012 drought and the consequent impacts on water supply, stream temperature, and energy demand and production. Driven by regional scenarios of climate change and the RCPs, the models are also being used to project changes in water deficits in the U.S. Changes in droughts and their compounding effects through changes in multiple variables such as precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and stream temperature will be analyzed to provide insights on vulnerability of the water and energy systems.",

The general methods on network analogies were presented in a terse monograph (Madden, 1972) which came to be called “The Grey Peril” by his students, named more for the challenge of deciphering the material as for the color of its cover. This talk will focus on Ted’s first major use of the transmission line analogy in treating the Earth’s Schumann resonances. This approach in Madden and Thompson (1965) provided a greatly simplified two-dimensional treatment of an electromagnetic problem with a notable three-dimensional structure. This skillful treatment that included the role of the Earth’s magnetic field also led to predictions that the Schumann resonance energy would leak into space, predictions that have been verified nearly 50 years later in satellite observations. An extension of the network analogy by Nelson (1967) using Green’s function methods provides a means to treat the inverse problem for the background Schumann resonances for the global lightning activity. The development of Madden’s methods will be discussed along with concrete results based on them for the monitoring of global lightning.",

            "abstract": "Spectral detections from VNIR imaging spectrometers OMEGA and CRISM suggest feldspar-bearing rocks with <5% mafic minerals in restricted locations on Mars. The detections have been interpreted as anorthositic, or alternatively, felsic lithologies such as granite. The detections occur in a variety of contexts, including crater central peaks, walls, and floors, intercrater plains of Noachis Terra, and the Nili patera caldera floor. Here we focus on the Noachis Terra feldspathic rock detections, and present constraints from geologic context and complementary thermal infrared measurements. We also examine mechanisms for forming feldspar-rich lavas from crystal fractionation at the base of thick Martian crust. Noachis Terra exposures exhibit high thermal inertias and deep spectral contrast, consistent with competent, non-porous rock. They commonly overlie olivine basaltic bedrock and are ~20-25 m thick. THEMIS spectra from these units are inconsistent with quartz abundances > 5%, ruling out felsic compositions. THEMIS spectra are consistent with both anorthositic and basaltic lithologies; laboratory spectra of these lithologies are indistinguishable at THEMIS resolution. TES spectra do not match library anorthosites, with ~20-30% modeled pyroxene and ~5-10% olivine. Strong contribution from basaltic sediment to the TES spectra is unlikely given the deeper spectral contrast associated with the feldspathic units than underlying olivine basaltic bedrock. Future work will include spectral comparison with other low silica, feldspathic rocks to determine if there is an analog material that is consistent with both the VNIR and TIR observations. The geologic context of the Noachis units suggests volcanic, rather than plutonic origins, although shallow sills or subglacial eruptive units are possible. Previous experimental and modeling work by Nekvasil showed that feldspar-rich (up to 75 wt%), low-silica lavas may be produced from known Martian basalt by shallow crystallization of liquids residual to partial fractionation at the base of a thick Martian crust. The plagioclase fraction increases with both the extent and depth of fractionation. Given that Noachis Terra is associated with thick highlands crust, this mechanism would be a plausible explanation for feldspathic rock detections in this region.",

            "abstract": "Cloud cover and relative humidity in the tropics are strongly influenced by organized atmospheric convection, which occurs across a range of spatial and temporal scales. One mode of organization that is found in idealized numerical simulations is “self-aggregation”, a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed convection to organized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. We explore the influence of domain geometry on the mechanisms and temperature-dependence of self-aggregation of tropical convection. Specifically, the System for Atmospheric Modeling is used to perform 3-d simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in a non-rotating framework, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea surface temperature. The results of simulations employing a highly elongated 3-d channel domain, in which self-aggregation takes the form of multiple moist and dry bands, are compared to that of a square domain, in which self-aggregation takes the form of a single moist cluster. For both domain types, and across a range of temperatures, we characterize the fundamental physical mechanisms that lead to self-aggregation as well as its growth rate and spatial scale. The variance budget equation for the vertically integrated frozen moist static energy is used to quantify the mechanisms governing self-aggregation and characterize its time scale. We find that diabatic processes dominate the evolution of self-aggregation in the elongated channel simulations. In contrast, in the square domain simulations, similar diabatic processes dominate the initial stages of aggregation but up-gradient advection by the circulation plays a role in the later stages. Self-aggregation occurs across a much wider range of temperatures with elongated channel geometry than with square geometry. As the sea surface temperature is increased in the channel simulations, the aggregated state is characterized by smaller spatial scales and more regularity. An advantage of the channel geometry is that a separation distance between convectively active regions can be defined, which is a prerequisite for developing a spatial scaling theory.",

            "abstract": "The oil and gas are often trapped in low-porosity/low-permeability formations such as shale or tight sands. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used technique to create fractures in the rock and allow oil and gas to flow into the production well. During this process, microseismics are usually accompanying fractures. These signals can be recorded by 3-component geophone arrays to provide effective monitoring to the fracture process. By locating microseismic events associated with fractures, it is possible to determine the geometry of the fracture zone and the effective production volume; observe any interactions with existing faults or events located out of fault zone.\nA set of quasi-linear equations relating observed P and S wave arrival times with source locations and velocity parameters were formulated. With this equation, both source and medium parameters can then be simultaneously determined by a least squares method. As an example, we document here the successful application of this method to hydraulic fracturing data observed at Shengli Oilfield. The proposed joint inversion can reduce the misfit between the picked and modeled traveltimes while provide correct locations for microsesmic sources and velocity model parameters. The final estimation of hypocenter for all 12 phase after 7 iterations is shown in Figure 1, where their colors denote fractures in different hydraulic stages and sizes indicate the event magnitudes. The microseismic activities are mostly around the horizontal fracturing well or close to the monitoring well, with rest events scattering throughout the entire model space.",

            "abstract": "The last thirty-five years have been a watershed for deep-sea microbiology. The discovery of hydrothermal vents and their extraordinarily productive communities, along with the discovery of the deep subsurface biosphere and their slow-growing, energy-starved microbial communities have changed our ideas about the nature and extent of microbial life in the deep sea. Moreover, the avent of genomics and other -omics further reshaped our understanding of microbial evolution and ecology.\nNevertheless, after decades of research, there remain a number of long-standing questions regarding the distribution and activity of microbes in situ. For example, we know that hydrothermal vents are energy-rich environments, and the energy for microbial primary productivity at hydrothermal vents is primarily derived from compounds that are in disequilibria between hot, reduced thermal fluids and the ambient, oxidized bottom seawater. However, we have a rudimentary understanding of how microbes are distributed within this geochemical gradient, and how temporal variability in fluid flow and even eruptions influences primary and secondary productivity. At the other extreme, deep subsurface environs can be very energy limiting, and microbes are seemingly limited in their access to either electron donors (e.g. dissolved organic matter, or DOM) or electron acceptors (e.g. oxygen). Yet here, recent data revealed patterns of microbial activity in the deep subsurface that are inconsistent with our conventional wisdom, and suggest that the availability of electron donors/acceptors may be greater than previously thought.\nHere we present our latest data, as well as the technologies and methods that allow us to synoptically measure geochemistry and microbial processes (community composition and gene expression) over space and time. Our findings reveal striking patterns of microbial distribution, gene expression and activity within a vent field and in the deep subsurface that begin to shed some light on the relationship between microbial ecology and physiology and biogeochemical cycles.",

            "abstract": "A significant fraction of the magma that is added from the mantle to the subvolcanic plumbing system ultimately erupts at the surface. The initial volatile content of the magmas as well as the interplay between volatile loss and magma ascent plays a significant role in determining the eruption style (effusive versus explosive) as well as the magnitude of the eruption.\nThe October 17, 1974 sub-Plinian eruption of Volcán de Fuego represents a particularly well-characterized system in terms of volatile content and magma chemistry to investigate the relation between initial water content of the magmas and the ascent rate. By modeling volatile element distribution in melt embayments through diffusion and degassing during ascent we can estimate magma ascent from the storage region in the crust to the surface. The novel aspect is the measurement of concentration gradients multiple volatile elements (in particular CO2, H2O, S) at fine-scale (5–10 μm) using the NanoSIMS. The wide range in diffusivity and solubility of these different volatiles provides multiple constraints on ascent timescales over a range of depths. H2O, CO2, and S all decrease toward the embayment outlet bubble documenting the loss of H2O and CO2 compared to an extensive melt inclusion suite from the same day of the eruption.\nThe data is best described by a two-stage model. At high pressure (>145 MPa) decompression is slow (0.05– 0.3 MPa/s) and CO2 is bled off predominantly. At shallow levels decompression accelerates to 0.3–0.5 MPa/s at the point of H2O exsolution, which strongly affects the buoyancy of the ascending magma. The magma ascent rates presented are among the first for explosive basaltic eruptions and demonstrate the potential of the embayment method for quantifying magmatic timescales associated with eruptions of different vigor.\n[1] Lloyd et al.

On encountering shallower slopes at 1 km, the lava stalled to form a perched pond contained by a barrier of its own breccia and ramped-up sediment. Intrusions through the barrier fed flow that advanced a further 4 km at velocities of a few tens of m/day. Distally, Tiretaine lavas built an inflated flow field with its front at the head of the Tiretaine valley. Failure of this front fed lava that entered the valley at effusion rates of several hundred m3/s. Lava descended as far as the current town of Royat, where it encountered, and ponded behind, a barrier built by Grave Noire lavas. If occurring today, these flows would impact more than 8422 addresses, 0.065 km² industrial land, 177 km of roads and 110 ha of agricultural land.\nOutcrop exposure of lavas is outstanding throughout the Chaine des Puys, allowing 3D viewing of such effusive systems. At Grave Noire and Tiretaine, we have analogs for perched ponds, channels, and satellite shields experiencing flank collapse to feed flow at high local effusion rates. The juxtaposition of central France’s capital, and the lavas themselves, vividly demonstrate effusive hazards faced by urban areas located in active monogenetic systems.",

One of these models is fostered through the NSF's Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) program, which pairs a graduate fellow with a science teacher at a local school for an entire school year. In our project, a PhD Earth Sciences student was paired with a local middle school science teacher with the goal of installing a weather station, and incorporating the station data into the 8th grade science curriculum. Here we discuss how we were able to use a school weather station to introduce weather and climate material, engage and involve students in the creative process of science, and motivate students through inquiry-based lessons. In using a weather station as the starting point for material, we were able to make science tangible for students and provide an opportunity for each student to experience the entire process of scientific inquiry. This hands-on approach resulted in a more thorough understanding the system beyond a knowledge of the components, and was particularly effective in challenging prior weather and climate misconceptions. We were also able to expand the reach of the lessons by connecting with other weather stations in our region and even globally, enabling the students to become members of a larger system.",

Scientific hydrology over the past two decades has advanced the physical understanding of hydrologic and related processes and their complex interactions and has generalized ideas and frameworks of estimation and prediction. Equipped with the engineering and scientific aspects of a field, hydrologist are in the best possible position to address new challenges related to sustainability of water quantity and quality under increasing stresses of climate and human perturbations while protecting ecosystem services and economic development. The first line of defense in studying a complex system for sustainability (ability to maintain the system integrity and functionality under perturbations) is to identify its vulnerable spots (places, times, processes that are more susceptible to change). A reductionist approach to such an endeavor is limited. Studying the system in parts with the most sophisticated distributed highly parameterized physically-based models and under non-stationarity might not provide insight into the emergent behavior at larger scales and longer times, exactly what is needed for identifying vulnerabilities that would inform policy and management for a sustainable future. We will present some ideas on a revised systems-approach to vulnerability science in hydro-geomorphologic systems under change via two examples. One example is a dynamic connectivity river network approach for predicting hotspots of geomorphic change in a Midwestern US river basin which is undergoing land-use and hydrologic changes. The other example relates to a new vulnerability assessment framework for delta systems undergoing change where network connectivity and delivery of fluxes dictates local places and actions that would most drastically affect the system as a whole.",

We discuss here how the consideration of the water table as a dynamic lower boundary for the vadose zone and the inclusion of lateral flow driven by gravitation, which redistributes groundwater horizontally, create a persistent underlying pattern on soil moisture conditions linked to topography, with wetter valleys and drier hilltops. The long scales of evolution of groundwater induce soil moisture memory, and groundwater-surface water exchanges are fundamental for wetland, river and floodplain dynamics. One step further, this reshaping of the land-surface hydrology by groundwater has an important impact on climate and ecosystems, via evapotranspiration and sensible heat fluxes. We will show some examples of the key role of groundwater on the terrestrial water and energy cycles using a fully coupled groundwater-soil-vegetation-atmosphere model.",

            "abstract": "Variations in surface conditions can significantly influence the exchange of heat and moisture between the land and atmosphere. As a result, measurements of surface fluxes using disparate methods not only may differ, they may fail to represent the surrounding landscape due to localized differences in surface conditions. To illustrate this, data collected over adjacent cotton fields during the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote Sensing Experiment (BEAREX08) will be used. The evapotranspiration (ET) within each field was determined via lysimetry (LY), mass balance using neutron probe (NP) data, and a pair of eddy covariance (EC) systems. A comparison of the cumulative ET from each field showed that ET from LY was 20% to 25% greater than that derived from NP and 10% to 15% greater than those from EC. Additionally, the cumulative flux for the two fields collected using the same approach differed by 5% to 10%. These discrepancies can be explained, in large part, by the variations in vegetation density within the two fields. Not only were there substantial variations in the leaf area index (LAI) within the source areas of the different measurement systems – for example, the LAI within LY was, on average, 0.4 m2 m-2 greater than the LAI within the source area of NP – there were also significant differences in the LAI between the fields as a whole. The cumulative ET output by the remote sensing-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model was also compared to the cumulative ET from each of the three measurement approaches. Depending on which measurement technique is used, the model either underestimated the moisture flux by approximately 5%, in the case of LY, or overestimated the flux by nearly 20%, in the case of NP. Comparison of the model output with EC data also indicated that the model overestimated ET, in this case, by approximately 10%. Clearly, the choice of which dataset is used to validate the model significantly effects the conclusions drawn regarding the model’s accuracy and utility in estimating ET. The results of this study also underscores the limitations of each of these measurement techniques and the need to understand those limitations when using observational datasets to make general conclusions about field scale ET and validating model output.",

            "abstract": "Upwelling is an important physical process affecting biogeochemical cycling within the global ocean. Direct measurements are difficult because of the relatively small velocities involved, and must therefore be inferred by indirect methods such as those provided by tracer observations. Measurements of the cosmogenic radioisotope 7Be (half-life = 53.3 d) were used to derive upwelling rates and upper thermocline vertical diffusivities during the 2013 US GEOTRACES Eastern Tropical Pacific Zonal Transect. In the eastern, upwelling zone of this transect, the 7Be activity in the mixed layer varied between low values of 63 dpm/m3 in areas with the coldest sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to values of 190 dpm/m3 associated with warm SSTs. The 7Be inventory in the coldest water was only 5,150 dpm/m2 while that in the warmer water was 19,000 dpm/m2. The decrease in mixed layer 7Be with decrease in temperature occurs as 7Be ‘‘dead’’, cold water is upwelled from below. The deficit of the 7Be inventory relative to the non-upwelling stations provides a measure of the upwelling rate. For the eastern-most station with the lowest SST (17.6 deg C) an upwelling rate of 2.56 m/d was derived. Towards the west, as SST increased, derived upwelling rates decreased. At SST of 20.9 deg C, upwelling was zero. With knowledge of upwelling rates, 7Be and temperature profiles were used to constrain vertical diffusivity within the upper thermocline. Diffusivities derived from 7Be profiles were approximately twice that derived from temperature, likely reflecting the difference in vertical resolution of these measurements. Diffusivities derived from temperature were on the order of 1-4 x 10-4 m2/s. These parameters will be applied to profiles of nutrients and trace elements to derive fluxes of these species into the mixed layer.",

            "abstract": "Seismology provides powerful methods for imaging the interior of the Earth, not only through differences in seismic velocities, but also through attenuation contrasts. As seismic waves travel through the Earth they are attenuated in accordance with the viscoelastic properties of the material through which they pass. With proper constraints, we will someday be able to use seismic attenuation data as a prospecting tool to determine the grain size, temperature, pressure, melt content, and water content of the material along the ray path. Furthermore, it should be possible to determine active deformation structure, such as crystallographic preferred orientations that form in response to far-field natural tectonic loading. Laboratory studies are striving to provide these needed constraints. Using analogues to mantle rock, we isolate and scrutinize the physics of how microstructural elements affect macroscopic properties of attenuation and steady-state viscosity. An organic analogue, borneol, was used to measure the effects of grain size, temperature, and melt content over a broad frequency range. In these experiments, grain boundary processes were found to play a major role. Polycrystalline ice, which can be considered a rock analogue, has been used to explore the effect of accumulated strain on attenuation, particularly in material that is actively deforming via dislocation creep. Here, defect concentration and substructure are important. I will discuss the use of cyclic loading experiments on borneol and on polycrystalline ice to probe material response from seismic to tidal frequencies, from 10 Hz to 10-4 Hz respectively. These experiments, then, inform our knowledge of viscoelastic behavior of geologic materials at not only seismic frequencies, but also the tidal forcing frequencies experienced by tidewater glaciers and icy satellites.",

            "abstract": "North-facing slopes in semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere are commonly steeper than south-facing slopes, whereas the converse is observed in the southern hemisphere. In the absence of a structural cause, the most common explanations for topographic asymmetry ultimately invoke aspect-related microclimate. Landscapes with asymmetric topography are therefore potential natural laboratories for investigating the sensitivity of surface processes to climate. However, the specific mechanisms driving asymmetry are not well understood, and studies using asymmetric topography to investigate landscape climate sensitivity may have to consider multiple origins of the asymmetry. Two leading hypotheses have emerged. One states that small differences in microclimate cause differences in the efficiency of erosional processes on slopes with different aspect. The more efficiently eroding slope erodes faster until the resulting slope asymmetry compensates for the difference in erosional efficiency. According to the other hypothesis, the difference in erosional efficiency is not sufficient to create the observed topographic asymmetry. Instead, sediment aggradation at the foot of the more quickly eroding slope forces lateral channel migration and undercutting of the opposing slope. These two explanations for topographic asymmetry predict different trajectories of long-term landscape evolution – sustained migration of asymmetric valleys would drive stream capture and drainage reorganization, whereas the mechanism without lateral channel migration would not – but there is no existing test capable of distinguishing between them. We develop such a test using a landscape evolution model that simulates different asymmetry-forming mechanisms, including asymmetric runoff production, channel incision threshold, soil creep, and lateral channel migration. For the case of topographic asymmetry produced by lateral channel migration, the model predicts that north-facing hilltops should be more concave-down than south-facing hilltops. We apply this criterion to a field site with strongly asymmetric slopes and evaluate the extent to which lateral channel migration has contributed to the development of the asymmetry.",

As researchers and educators it is good for us to regularly remember that our research and outreach efforts are critical to people around the world, many of whom are desperate for solutions to water quality and supply problems and their impacts on food supply, land management, and ecosystem protection. In this presentation, recommendations for successful applied research on agricultural impacts on water resources will be provided. The benefits of building multidisciplinary teams will be illustrated with examples related to the development and world-wide application of the ALMANAC, SWAT, and EPIC/APEX models. The value of non-traditional partnerships will be shown by the Soil Health Partnership, a coalition of agricultural producers, chemical and seed companies, and environmental advocacy groups. The results of empowering decision-makers with useful data will be illustrated with examples related to bacteria source and transport data and the MANAGE database, which contains runoff nitrogen and phosphorus data for cultivated, pasture, and forest land uses. The benefits of focusing on sustainable solutions will be shown through examples of soil testing, fertilizers application, on-farm profit analysis, and soil health assessment. And the value of welcoming criticism will be illustrated by the development of a framework to estimate and publish uncertainty in measured discharge and water quality data.\nThe good news for researchers is that the agricultural industry is faced with profitability concerns and the need to wisely utilize soil and water resources, and simultaneously state and federal agencies crave sound-science to improve decision making, policy, and regulation.

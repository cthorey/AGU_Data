            "abstract": "We recently carried out the first integrated deep seismic experiment in the United Arabic Emirates (UAE) from the Arabian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. Reflection data were acquired along 925 line km in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman using a large-volume airgun source (7060 cubic inches) and up to 5 km long streamer. Refraction data were acquired along selected reflection lines using 25 land recording stations in the UAE. In addition, gravity and magnetic anomaly data were acquired along all the seismic lines.\nThe objective of the seismic experiment is to determine the crust and mantle structure associated with UAE orogenic belt, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Gulf. In addition, the experiment aims to determine mechanisms of ophiolite emplacement and the velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the orogenic belt and the flanking UAE foreland basin and offshore Furairah/Sharjah.\nPreliminary results of the experiment will be presented including initial findings of seismic reflection, refraction and potential field data. Seismic reflection data in the Gulf of Oman, for example, show evidence for post-rift and syn-rift sedimentation, tilted fault blocks and re-activated faults that appear to have offset the seafloor. Other findings include delineation, using gravity and magnetic data, of the offshore extent of the ophiolite, its thickness and the nature of its bounding faults.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridges, largely present far from the continental plates, are characterized by complex geological structures and numerous hydrothermal systems with complex controlling factors. Exploring seafloor sulfide resources for industrial and scientific applications is a challenge. With the advent of geophysical surveys for seabed investigation, near-bottom magnetic prospecting, which yields shallow geological structure, is an efficient method for investigating active and inactive hydrothermal fields and for researching the structure of hydrothermal systems (Tivey et al., 1993, 1996；German et al., 2008).\nWe collected near-bottom magnetic data in the Longqi hydrothermal area, located in the southwest Indian ridge (49.6° E; Zhu et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2014), using the autonomous benthic explorer, an autonomous underwater vehicle, during the second leg of the Chinese cruise DY115-19 on board R/V DaYangYiHao. Based on the results of the intensity of the spatial differential vector method (Seaman et al., 1993), we outline the hydrothermal alternation zone. By building models, we subsequently infer a fault along the discovered hydrothermal vents; this fault line may be connected to a detachment fault (Zhao et al., 2013). In addition, we discuss the channels of the hydrothermal circulation system (Figure 1), and presume that heat was conducted to the sea subsurface by the detachment fault; the aqueous fluid that infiltrated the fault is heated and conveyed to the seafloor, promoting the circulation of the hydrothermal system.",

            "abstract": "Geofluids contain a large amount of silica, which solubility changes depending on temperature and pressure. Ubiquitous occurrences of various silica deposits (quartz veins, silica sinter, scales) suggest that silica precipitation plays an important role on temporal and spatial variation of hydrological properties of the Earth’s crusts. A pressure drop, for example, induced by seismicity, is one of the driving forces for silica precipitation within the crusts. In spite of the importance of silica depositions in fractures, how porosity and permeability evolution during silica precipitation is still poorly understood.\nIn this study, we conducted the hydrothermal experiments for silica precipitation from supersaturated solutions in vapor (370˚C, 20 MPa) and supercritical (420 ˚C, 30 MPa) conditions with flow rate of 1 g/min. After the experiments, we analyzed the 3-D porosity structures by X-ray CT, and then by making thin section. We developed a tube-in-tube vessel, which is composed of main vessel (made of SUS316), and inner alumina tube (6 mm inner diameter), to make a horizontal flow path. We did not used rock/mineral substrates, and alumina balls (1 mm diameter) are closely packed in the inner tube.\nIn both situations, a significant amount of silica deposited within a week, showing contrasting porosity structures between vapor and supercritical conditions. In vapor conditions, the precipitates are fine-grained quartz aggregate, and the most deposited at around 38 mm from the inlet. The pores were filled from the bottom to the top in the tube. In contrast, in the supercritical conditions, the precipitates are composites of amorphous silica and quartz; which accumulated around the alumina balls uniformly. Quartz grains are formed in amorphous silica layers, and the most porosity reduction occurred at around 25 mm from the inlet. A simple model of cellular automaton involving particle flow, adsorption, settling and deposition reveals that the relative magnitude of gravitational settling and adsorption controls the contrasting porosity pattern. Amorphous silica could be transport in long distance and adsorbed uniformly on the wall, whereas quartz grains nucleated in vapor immediately settled on the bottom, which could generate the contrasting vein textures.",

Restricted to the use of only first arrivals of P- and S-wave, the travel-time tomographic models of Taiwan can simulate the seismic waveform barely to a frequency of 0.2 Hz to date. While it has been sufficient for long-period studies, e.g. source inversion, this frequency band is still far from the applications to the community and high-resolution studies. To achieve a higher-frequency simulation, more data and the considerations of off-path and finite-frequency effects are necessary. Based on the spectral-element and the adjoint method recently developed, we prepared 94 MW 3.5-6.0 earthquakes with well-defined location and focal mechanism solutions from Real-Time Moment Tensor Monitoring System (RMT), and preformed an iterative gradient-based inversion employing waveform modeling and finite-frequency measurements of adjoint method. By which the 3-D sensitivity kernels are taken into account realistically and the full waveform information are naturally sought, without a need of any phase pick. A preliminary model m003 using 10-50 sec data was demonstrated and compared with previous travel-time models. The primary difference appears in the mountainous area, where the previous travel-time model may underestimate the S-wave speed in the upper crust, but overestimates in the lower crust.",

            "abstract": "A rare and unique observation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves has been studied for the Cassini and WIND satellites during the Cassini Earth flyby on 18th August, 1999, across the Earth’s magnetosheath. Magnetic field data from Cassini and WIND for the time interval 0152-0226 UT are analyzed to characterize the wave modes when the satellites were present in the subsolar and dusk side magnetosheath, respectively. A new technique/program called Rosetta Automatic Wave Analysis (RAWA) has been developed based on the method initiated by Tsurutani et. al., 2013 to study the wave cycles. Various wave mode characteristics like frequency, ellipticity, propagation angle, and wave polarization are determined and are characterized statistically. Cassini and WIND wave cycle analysis suggest that almost all the waves (> 80%) were left hand circularly polarized waves with frequencies lying at or below the proton cyclotron frequency. This indicates abundance of ion (proton) cyclotron mode propagation in the Earth's magnetosheath for the aforementioned interval. No obvious mirror mode indications were found as there were no linearly polarized waves detected. The waves which were either right hand polarized or had frequencies greater than the proton cyclotron frequency were consistent with their being left hand waves with frequencies less than proton cyclotron frequency in the plasma frame. We thus conclude that the waves detected at both Cassini and WIND are electromagnetic left hand polarized proton cyclotron waves. There is no evidence of mode conversion to (plasma frame) right hand waves, even though the wave amplitudes are exceptionally large (10 nT). Majority of the waves were found to propagate parallel (<30o) to the ambient magnetic field and were circularly polarized. However it is also found that for waves propagating at oblique angles to B0, the polarization is still circular. This is not understood at this time. Proton cyclotron waves detected at Cassini and WIND were found to be quasi-coherent and compressive. The Earth's magnetosheath was found to have unusually low plasma beta (β=0.35) during the Cassini traversal which would have possibly favored the ion cyclotron modes over mirror modes.",

            "abstract": "Over temperate glaciers images obtained from ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) are often blurred because electromagnetic waves are scattered on water pockets or by complex glacial bed topography, or damped due to a higher overall water content within the glacier. A combination of seismic and GPR surveying can increase the data information content and aid interpretation of subsurface structure.\nIn September 2012 we acquired surface and borehole GPR and seismic data in the ablation zone of the Rhone Glacier located in central Switzerland. GPR data were acquired using antenna frequencies of 25, 50 and 100 MHz. Active reflection seismic data were recorded along a coincident profile across the glacier. Seismic waves were generated with small explosive sources spaced at 4m, and recorded on 30 Hz geophones at 2 m spacing. Both methods resulted in images showing a maximum depth of the glacier of approximately 130 m. However, the seismic image of the glacier bed was of much higher resolution and showed a clear primary reflection from the base, whereas the GPR image often showed several reflections of similar amplitude, above and from the bedrock interface, or no reflection at all. We interpreted a series of crenulations along the glacier bed reflector in the seismic image as melt water channels. This interpretation was supported by the intermittent nature of GPR glacier bed reflections, which are expected to be more sensitive to changes in water content than to the ice-rock interface.\nFirst break travel time inversions of the surface seismic data yielded velocities of 3320 m/s near the top of the glacier, and remarkably constant values of 3720 m/s at depths below 4.5m. However, travel time inversion of seismic data between boreholes which penetrated as far as the glacier bed, indicate a 3D anisotropy of seismic velocity, ranging from 3650 m/s horizontally across the glacier to 3850 m/s horizontally along the line of the glacier. Vertical seismic velocity was found to lie between these values. The seismic anisotropy is most likely caused by preferred c-axis orientations of the ice crystals.",

J. Int., 2011; Hector et al., Geophys. J. Int., 2013). However some recent papers reported a disappointing potential of gravity measurements during a pumping experiment in a sandy aquifer (Blainey et al., WRR, 2007; Herckenrath et al., WRR, 2012) and their poor ability in constraining the transmissity and specific yield of the aquifer, which are the parameters to which pumping tests give access.\nFresh basement rocks present generally a null porosity and the structure of basement aquifers is given by the weathering profile. In tropical climate, this profile consists of a few tens meter thick saprolite layer, with noticeable porosity but low permeability overlying the weathering front. This weathering front includes in many instances a fractured medium and presents a high permeability with variable porosity. It is hardly sampled in coring experiments. We present some numerical simulation results on the ability of gravity to constrain the transmissivity of this medium. Due to poroelasticity of clay minerals in the saprolite, soil subsidence is expected to occur during pumping with a significant gravity effect. Gravity measurements have therefore to be completed with leveling data at a millimetric precision.\nWe present first the results of numerical modeling of the gravity and subsidence for a theoretical horizontally stratified basement aquifer, and show that gravity and leveling are able to provide independently the poroelasticity coefficient and a single transmissivity coefficient for the bottom of the aquifer, if the properties of the upper saprolites are known.\nWe will discuss then the general case, where the aquifer presents a vertical fracture where the weathering profile thickens.",

Many countries have had difficulty maintaining water supplies and mitigating user conflicts during recent droughts, for example during Australia’s Millennium Drought (1998-2010) and the recent droughts in the USA (2012), Europe (early 2000s) and UK (2011/12). With climate projections suggesting that droughts will intensify in many regions, the magnitude of this threat is likely to increase and thus vulnerability of society to drought must be reduced through better preparedness. The Belmont Forum project DrIVER (Drought impacts: Vulnerability thresholds in monitoring and Early-warning Research) aims to contribute to better preparedness by improving links between natural (hydrometeorological) drought characterisation and environmental and socio-economic impacts. Better integration of drought characterisation and impacts are expected to lead to enhanced drought monitoring and early-warning systems and other risk management strategies. We present results from a comparison of the monitoring and early-warning capacity and past drought impacts in case studies on three continents, North America, Europe and Australia.

From its principal site of formation in the SE Pacific, a significant proportion of AAIW is entrained in the Antarctic circumpolar current and enters the Atlantic through Drake Passage. Air-sea interaction within the subAntarctic SW Atlantic modifies this AAIW further, producing a cooler and fresher Atlantic end member of AAIW. Our core site is located where this branch of AAIW subducts and travels northwards along the western margin of the Atlantic basin.\nWe present the first high-resolution, multi-proxy study of AAIW in the sub-Antarctic SW Atlantic over the last 140 kyrs. Here, we focus on the temperature and salinity records over the last two glacial terminations and at the onset of the last glaciation. We use a combination of benthic stable isotopes and elemental ratios (Mg/Ca) on the shallow infaunal species Uvigerina peregrina to reconstruct AAIW temperature and salinity.\nOur records suggest that AAIW temperature both increased and decreased in a step-wise manner over the last 120 kyrs hinting at 3 ‘stable’ states for AAIW through the last glacial cycle (see shaded areas within figure). Another common feature is a transient interval of apparently warm, saline AAIW observed at the onset of both glacial terminations – could this be evidence of the ‘deep, salty blob’ or of increased outflow of Pacific surface waters?\nWe identify some fundamental differences between termination I and termination II; AAIW appears to have been markedly warmer during MIS6 than at the LGM. Furthermore, the glacial-interglacial potential density difference is much greater over termination I than termination II.",

            "abstract": "Because metamorphism comprises a complex sequence of structural changes and chemical reactions that can be extended over several millions of years, metamorphic rocks cannot in general be said to have \"an age\". As a consequence, interpreting radiometric age data from metamorphic rocks requires first to establish the behavior of the isotopic system used for dating relative to the P-T conditions that a metamorphic rock experienced. As the U-Th-Pb system in monazite and allanite is not easily reset during subsequent temperature increase, allanite and monazite ages are interpreted as reflecting crystallization ages. Consequently, to interpret allanite and monazite crystallization ages, it is crucial to determine the physical conditions of their crystallization.\nA detailed account of the textural and chemical evolution of allanite and monazite along a well constrained prograde metamorphic suite of detrital sediments of the Greater Himalaya of Zanskar reveals that: (1) allanite is the stable REE accessory phase in the biotite and garnet zone and (2) at the staurolite-in isograd, allanite disappears abruptly from the metamorphic assemblage, simultaneously with the occurrence of the first metamorphic monazite. The finding of both monazite and allanite as inclusion in staurolite indicates that the breakdown of allanite and the formation of monazite occurred during staurolite crystallization. The preservation of allanite and monazite inclusions in garnet core and rim respectively allows to accurately identify the P-T conditions of the formation of the first metamorphic monazite. Thermobarometry indicates that, in both cases, monazite crystallization occurred at 600 °C. The fact that the substitution of allanite by monazite occurs spatially close, i.e. at similar P-T conditions, in all types of rocks whether they are Al-rich metapelites or more psammitic metasediments indicates that major silicate phases like staurolite or garnet do not play a significant role in the monazite forming reaction. Our data shows that the occurrence of the first metamorphic monazites in the rocks is mainly dependent on the pressure-temperature conditions and not on the bulk chemistry of the rocks. Dating monazite in metapelites means thus constraining the timing when these rocks reached the 600 °C isotherm.",

Only few authors dealt with the experimental determination of high-pressure COH fluid species at different conditions, using diverse experimental and analytical approaches (e.g., piston cylinder+capsule-piercing+gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry; cold-seal+silica glass capsules+Raman).\nWe performed experiments on COH fluids using a capsule-piercing device coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometry. This type of analyzer ensures superior performances in terms of selectivity of molecules to be detected, high acquisition rates and extended linear response range.\nExperiments were carried out in a rocking piston cylinder apparatus at pressure of 1 GPa and temperatures from 800 to 900°C. Carbon-saturated fluids were generated through the addition of oxalic acid dihydrate and graphite. Single/double capsules and different packing materials (BN and MgO) were used to evaluate the divergence from the thermodynamic speciation model. Moreover, to assess the effect of solutes on COH fluid speciation we also performed a set of experiments adding synthetic forsterite to the charge.\nTo determine the speciation we assembled a capsule-piercing device that allows to puncture the capsule in a gas-tight vessel at 80°C. The extraction Teflon vessel is composed of a base part, where the capsule is allocated on a steel support, and a top part where a steel drill is mounted. To release the quenched fluids from the capsule, the base part of vessel is hand-tighten to the top part, allowing the steel pointer to pierce the capsule. The evolved gases are then convoyed to a quadrupole mass spectrometer through a heated line to avoid the condensation of water.\nOur results suggest that fluid speciation can diverge considerably compared to the thermodynamic model depending on the experimental strategies adopted and on the presence of solutes in complex COH systems.",

Various researchers have been investigating carbonate rocks to exploit bitumen reservoirs. Grosmont Formation, located in northern Alberta, is one of the largest carbonate reservoirs in the world. We conducted inorganic geochemical analysis about two-carbonate rock cores of Grosmont Formation (well 10-12-93-24W4, 11-33-94-22W4), obtained from Core Research Center (CRC) in Canada to investigate the characteristics and origin of dolomite in the Grosmont Formation. Grosmont Formation consists of four carbonate units, UG3, UG2, UG1 and LG, with three shale beds, SB3, SB2 and SB1. Major and trace elements, and isotope compositions of dolomites from UG and LG units indicate that UG dolomites were formed within a near surface environment under evaporitic condition, whereas LG dolomites were formed in a diagenetic environment. UG and LG dolomites might be formed at temperature ranging from 43.9 °C to 56.7 °C with Devonian seawater.",

            "abstract": "There is a lack of consensus with regard to the observed enhanced concentrations of methane at East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), as well as on the long-running effect it may have on the global climate. One group of scientists suggest that it is attributed to venting from the deep layers, and may dramatically increase in the coming decades due to thawing and increased perforation of permafrost, ultimately leading to amplification of the global warming. The other group refutes this hypothesis and supports the standpoint that the observed enhanced fluxes, up to 6-8 ppm whereas the latitude-mean is 185 ppm, are not related to recent permafrost changes but are rather attributed to the geological structure of the shelf.\nWe analyzed data from land, marine and satellite observations and developed the conceptual model that consistently explains the atmospheric methane field in the Arctic in the context of the past, present, and future environmental changes. We explore the hypothesis, according to which enhanced concentrations of methane are associated with the geological history of ESAS. We hypothesized that observed enhanced methane venting is bound to unfrozen bottom sediments surrounding fault zones and paleo river beds, where permafrost never existed in the bottom sediments, while elsewhere on the inner shelf of ESAS sediments remain frozen and impermeable for gases since the last glacial maximum. We tested this hypothesis through analysis of the geological and paleo data, constructing the digital high resolution map of the fault zones and paleo river beds, comparing it with locations of the hydrographic stations where enhanced methane fluxes have been observed (Fig. 1), and performing spatial statistical analysis. We demonstrated that (1) the current rate of methane concentration rise over the ESAS does not exceed that in the rest of the Arctic and in the Northern hemisphere, and (2) the probability of methane concentrations being above the average decreases with the distance to the nearest fault zone or paleo river bed. These results do not support the hypothesis of the so-called “methane bomb” at ESAS.\nAcknowledgement. This study is supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project 14-17-00037.",

The discrepancy has been attributed to the presence of alumina, to that of ferric iron, to multiphase equilibria and even to the activity of FeO in the system. In order to mitigate the discrepancy, we synthesized a sample with San Carlos olivine composition that was doped in alumina. We then used this as starting material for experiments in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell at lower mantle (P,T) conditions along the geotherm. Samples were pressurized, heated, transformed to bridgemanite and ferropericlase, equilibrated, quenched, and decompressed. Thin sections were recovered from the hotspot using a focused ion beam microscope and the composition of the two phases was analyzed using analytical transmission electron microscopy.\nIron partitioning in Al-rich olivine will be discussed through a detailed comparison with the Al-rich pyrolitic trend and the Al-free olivine trend.\n",

We will use measurements made from a recent NASA field campaign, SEAC4RS to illustrate how such studies can be conducted. Also, we analyzed long-term data from MOZAIC project to corroborate the findings from SEAC4RS.

It was assumed that the constriction of the CAS reached a critical threshold during the early Pliocene (~4.8-4 Ma) and model simulations predicted a warming of the Northern Hemisphere and a cooling of the Southern Hemisphere, which climatic effects are known as “Panama hypothesis”. The constriction of the Indonesian seaway had profound climatic effects on the surrounding ocean areas during ~4-3 Ma, with possible effects for the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. We here present combined measurements of Mg/Ca and δ18O from planktic foraminifera to reconstruct sea surface temperatures and changes in salinities in both hemispheres during the Pliocene epoch. Within ~4.8-3.9 Ma our reconstructions support the Panama hypothesis with a simultaneous sea surface cooling and freshening of ~2-3 °C of southern hemisphere sites, when North Atlantic Site 552A indicate a warming and more saline conditions. After ~3.9 Ma, our data is in contrast to an ongoing restriction of the CAS and rather suggest that the constriction of the Indonesian Seaway might have reduced the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, leading to significant cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "There is an on-going debate about the length of residence time in silicic magmatic systems. Here, we present an example of a silicic volcanism characterized by several Ma long crystallization history, which is comparable with that of large silicic batholiths. In the Carpathian-Pannonian region, an ignimbrite flare-up episode occurred during the Miocene. This volcanism was fed by large volume silicic magmas and was coeval with the formation of the Pannonian basin by major lithospheric stretching. Excellent outcrops of these volcanic products are found in the Bükkalja Volcanic Field, northern part of the region. We performed high-precision in-situ zircon U-Pb dating by LA-ICP-MS using selected samples collected from continuous stratigraphic sections, comprising pyroclastic flow and fall deposits of the entire volcanism. We conducted at least 50 spot analyses for each samples and applied strict selection procedure to use only concordant data. The youngest age population of the Isoplot Unmix ages (in case of >5 MSWD; most of the samples) or the weighted mean ages are considered to be the closest to the eruption ages. According to these age data, the volcanism lasted from 18.2 Ma to 14.0 Ma, and the volcanic deposits can be well correlated. Six eruption events are distinguished separated by a few 100’s ka up to 1.6 Ma repose times. In case of most samples, the large MSWD values and the wide range of 206Pb/238U isotope ratios of the individual spot analyses suggest prolonged (even more than 1.5-2 Ma) zircon crystallization. Based on the evaluation of the whole data set, 10 zircon crystallization peak-periods started at 19.6 Ma can be clearly distinguished. This is consistent with a model involving a long-lasting silicic crystal mush system with periodic rejuvenation of zircon crystallization and withdrawal of medium to large volume eruptible magmas. This requires elevated heat-flux and thermally prepared upper crust during the Middle Miocene continental rifting period.",

            "abstract": "Silicon and carbon cycling are related both on short time scales via the uptake of carbon dioxide and dissolved silica (DSi) by diatoms, and on geological time scales via weathering of silicate rocks consuming carbon dioxide. Long-term changes in oceanic silicon cycling and DSi concentration have been mostly attributed to the evolution of siliceous organisms, especially the colonization of the surface waters by diatoms and their diversification. Thus, impacts of geological mechanisms and changes in carbon cycling have been, in our opinion, overlooked. During the past decade, progress has been made in using silicon isotopes in marine archives to investigate the paleo-silicon cycle. Silicon isotope fractionation in siliceous sponges is closely related to ambient DSi concentration. It follows from this relationship that sponge spicules from marine sediment cores provide a good proxy for reconstructing the paleo-DSi concentration and isotopic composition. The Paleogene period (65.5 to 23Ma) is highly relevant for studying the long-term silicon and carbon cycling relationship due to radiance of diatoms, high variability in the carbon cycle and initiation of the Himalayan orogeny.\nHere, we will present a sponge spicules and radiolarian silicon isotopes record from ODP Leg 171B (Blake Nose, Western North Atlantic) spanning most of the Paleogene. Our data show similar patterns in both foraminiferal carbon and spicule silicon stable isotopes, providing information on the mechanisms coupling the long-term silicon and carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "The fragmentation of forests is occurring at an accelerated rate in parts of the United States. Forest fragmentation creates edge habitat that affects the biogeochemistry of forests. Atmospheric deposition is known to increase at the forest edge in comparison to the forest interior. Past research has demonstrated the critical role of edge effects on throughfall chemistry but no known work has examined the relationship between stemflow chemistry and edge effects. To fill this data gap, we quantified the stemflow acid neutralization capacity (ANC) of nineteen Liriodendron tulipifera L. (yellow poplar) trees between forest edge and interior locations in the Piedmont of the mid-Atlantic USA. ANC was measured directly by potentiometric titration. Both stemflow pH and ANC were higher for L. tulipifera trees on the forest edge as opposed to those in interior locations (p < 0.01), although marked variability was observed among individual trees. It is critical to note that the ANC of stemflow of edge trees is almost certainly contextual, depending on geographic locality. This is to say that stemflow from edge trees may neutralize acid inputs in some locations (as in our case) but lead to enhanced acidification of aqueous inputs to forest soils in other locales where the dry deposition of acid anions is high. The experimental results have ramifications for forest management schema seeking to increase or decrease the extent of edge habitat in forest fragments.",

            "abstract": "MJO is often considered a convectively-coupled wave. The present talk is going to argue that it is best understood primarily as a nonlinear solitary wave dominated by vorticity. Role of convection is secondary,\nthough likely catalytic.\nAccording to Charney's (1963) scale analysis, the large-scale tropical circulations are nondivergent to the leading order, i.e., dominated by rotational flows. Yano et al (2009) demonstrate indeed that is the case for a period dominated by three MJO events. The scale analysis of Yano and Bonazzola (2009, JAS) demonstrates such an asymptotically nondivergent regime is a viable alternative to the traditionally-believed equatorial-wave regime. Wedi and Smolarkiewicz (2010, JAS) in turn, show by numerical computations of a dry system that a MJO-like oscillation for a similar period can indeed be generated by free solitary nonlinear equatorial Rossby-wave dynamics\nwithout any convective forcing to a system.\nUnfortunately, this perspective is slow to be accepted with people's mind so much fixed on the role of convection. This situation may be compared to a slow historical process of acceptance of Eady and Charney's baroclinic\ninstability simply because it does not invoke any convection\nIronically, once the nonlinear free-wave view for MJO is accepted, interpretations can more easily be developed for a recent series of numerical model experiments under a global channel configuration over\nthe tropics with a high-resolution of 5-50 km with or without convection parameterization.\nAll those experiments tend to reproduce observed large-scale circulations associated with MJO rather well, though most of time, they fail to reproduce convective coherency associated with MJO.\nThese large-scale circulations appear to be generated by lateral forcing imposed at the latitudinal walls. These lateral boundaries are reasonably far enough (30NS) to induce any direct influence to the tropics. There is no linear dry equatorial wave that supports this period either. In Wedi and Smolarkiewicz's analysis, such a lateral forcing is essential in order to obtain their nonlinear solitary wave solution. Thus is the leading-order solution for MJO in the same sense as the linear baroclinic instability is a leading-order solution to the midlatitude synoptic-scale storm.",

            "abstract": "Detailed rainfall spatial distribution plays an important role in various applications of hydrological management such as flood forecasting or recharge estimation. However, limited rain gauge network density often makes it difficult to characterize the small-scale variability of rainfall, and reduces the reliability of interpolations methods such as kriging.\nHere, we test a non-parametric technique that produces spatial rainfall fields by relying on time series data rather than dense spatial data sets. If the velocity of the rain cells is known, the time series can be projected into a one-dimensional space, reflecting the same type of variability observable in the direction of the rain cell displacement.\nAssuming spatio-temporal ergodicity for a small area, we estimate the mean rainfall cells displacement direction i and velocity vi by optimizing the cross correlation between two subsequent radar images at time t and t+dt. Then, given a time series in the same time lapse R([t,...,t+dt]) and applying the linear transformation R([t,...,t+dt])=S([t,...,t+dt]vi), we obtain a spatial series S generally more densely informed than the available rain-gauge network, used to represent the spatial variability in the direction i. For example, from a 1 min spaced time series R and an estimated velocity v=20 km/h, we obtain a 333 m spaced series S.\nThe obtained spatial series are then employed as a basis to generate 2D spatial rainfall fields using the Direct Sampling (DS), a multiple-point technique that allows simulating complex statistical relations by respecting the similarity of multiple scales patterns. Here the DS is used to complete the 2D field by reproducing one-dimensional patterns borrowed from the spatial series.\nThe approach is tested on the rain-gauge network of the Swiss plateau (Switzerland) and on radar data for the same region. The proposed technique has the potential to characterize realistic spatial fields even for sparse observation networks.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convection is a non-linear system. Convection patterns are therefore not directly proportional to initialization parameters. We investigate which parameters affect convection evolution, and the timescales over which these effects are observable. To do this, we run thousands of mantle convection simulations, each model having different, randomly selected, thermal, rheological, and compositional starting parameters. Our convection program is StagYY, run in 2D spherical-annulus geometry with self-consistent mineral physics properties calculated in Perple_X. StagYY allows melting and basaltic crust production and includes decaying radiogenic heat production in both core and mantle.\nAt various timesteps after initiation, the temperature, density, and composition fields can be extracted. We train neural networks to find the most likely initial parameters responsible for any convection pattern. The networks produce probability density functions, so that the relative likelihood of any value of the inputs parameters can be calculated, allowing inversion of the non-linear convection systems. This means that the uncertainty of the result is also provided.\nAfter two billion years, we can find initial mantle potential temperature, initial CMB temperature, approximated initial mantle composition, reference viscosity, depth dependent viscosity, yield stress and the existence and thickness of any initial layer of primordial material. Our results suggest that the signal from these initialisation parameters is retained in the pattern of convection for much longer than 2 Gy. Our ultimate goal is to use tomographic models of the real mantle to investigate the ‘initialisation’ parameters of the Earth. We can also apply the same methodology to back-step convection, allowing us to build up a history of Earth’s mantle convection.",

            "abstract": "We develop a 3-D thermal model for a margin segment that extends from the southern Kuril Islands to NE Japan, using a realistic geometry for the subducting Pacific plate, and investigate the effect of 3-D mantle wedge flow on the mantle wedge temperature and its relation to the distribution of arc volcanoes. Mantle wedge flow is driven largely by viscous coupling between the subducting slab and the overlying mantle, and its flow pattern is influenced by the geometry of the subducting slab and the subduction direction relative to the trench. Along the southern Kuril-NE Japan margin, the slab takes a complex geometry with varying subduction obliquity. The 3-D modeling results show that in NE Japan, the directions of the mantle wedge in-flow and out-flow are E-W, nearly parallel to the subduction direction. However, in southern Kuril, due to oblique subduction, the mantle flows in from NE, obliquely to the subduction direction, and flows out parallel to the subduction direction. These mantle wedge flow patterns are consistent with those inferred from the measured seismic anisotropy of the mantle wedge. The predicted inflow directions in both NE Japan and southern Kuril correlate well with the E-W and NE-SW orientations of cross-arc chains, respectively, indicating that the cross-chain orientation may be guided by the mantle inflow direction. In southern Kuril, obliquity subduction and steeper slab dip results in slightly cooler mantle wedge than in Tohoku at shallow depths (<100 km depth). Further, the northerly mantle inflow in southern Kuril and the westerly inflow in NE Japan converge in the hinge zone where the slab bends to accommodate a dip direction change between southern Kuril and NE Japan, discouraging mantle inflow within the hinge zone and causing the mantle wedge to be relatively cold. The slab surface depths beneath the frontal volcanoes in southern Kuril and NE Japan are about 120 km and 100 km, respectively. The along-arc variation in the mantle wedge temperature likely affects the locations of melt generation and frontal volcanoes. We qualitatively examine whether the correlations between arc location, cross-chain orientation, slab geometry, and subduction obliquity that are found in southern Kuril and NE Japan are present elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "A recent publication suggests that there is a consistent temperature dependency of methane fluxes across ecosystems and scales. Strong correlations between methane flux and ecosystem temperature have been reported in numerous studies over the last three decades. However, while the correlation is high, even when combining data for many different ecosystems and scales, it does necessarily follow that the relationship in each ecosystem or at each scale are the same. A robust measure for ‘consistency’ would be to show that the parameters among the flux-temperature relationship parameters (i.e. slope and intercept) for each ecosystem and scale are not statistical different for different. Examining the statistical parameters of this relationship across numerous wetlands (one ecosystem type) show there is little consistency – the form of the function is universal but the application of the function is not. For example, across many northern peatland, while the slope of the relationship between flux and temperature are somewhat similar the intercepts are very different. These differences have been attributed to structural differences in the ecosystems – i.e. plant communities, and environmental conditions such as moisture content and nutrient availability. Peatlands that are being influenced by climate change, particularly those associated with thawing permafrost, the slope of the functional relationship between methane and temperature changes as the plant community structure and ecosystem productivity change. Also the time scales over which methane emission and ecosystem production correlate vary depending on the plant communities involved. The distinction between a generalized association between methane and temperature and a consistent function that could be used across ecosystems and scale is important for the simulation of methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "We will present an analysis of the rheology of mantle lithosphere based on extrapolation of lab-based flow laws, microstructural characterization of mantle shear zones and xenoliths, and the spatial distribution of mantle earthquakes and seismic anisotropy. As a starting point, we illustrate the similarity in the evolution of olivine lattice preferred orientation (LPO) for cm-scale lab samples (e.g., Zhang et al., 2000) and 100 meter-scale shear zones (e.g., Warren et al., 2008; Skemer et al., 2010). This correlation provides strong support for the extrapolation of lab data in both time and scale. The extrapolation of these results to plate-scale processes is supported by the analysis of shear wave splitting across the Alpine Fault on the South Island of New Zealand and its surrounding ocean basins (Zietlow et al., 2014). For the same region, the similarity in the fast Pn azimuth with the fast shear wave polarization directions indicates high strain deformation of relatively cold (~500-700oC) mantle lithosphere across a region 100-200 km wide (Collins and Molnar, 2014). This latter observation suggests that the lithosphere is significantly weaker than predicted by the extrapolation of dislocation creep or Peierls creep flow laws. Weakening via promotion of grain size sensitive creep mechanisms (diffusion creep and DisGBS) is likely at these conditions; however, studies of exhumed mantle shear zones generally indicate that the activation of these processes leads to strain localization at scales <<200 km. These observations motivate us to consider rheological constraints derived from geodetic studies and earthquake depths in regions where deformation of the lithosphere occurs at similar conditions. At face value, these data provide additional support for the extrapolation of lab data; the depth extent of earthquakes is consistent with estimates for the conditions where a transition from stable to unstable frictional sliding occurs (e.g., Boettcher et al., 2007) – and microstructures in xenoliths from actively deforming regions of the lithosphere constrain viscosities similar to those derived from analyses of post-seismic creep (e.g., Behr and Hirth, 2014). We will report on our continued effort to reconcile the apparent discrepancies presented by these studies.",

            "abstract": "Trace metal enrichments in sedimentary deposits are related to the processes also controlling production and preservation of organic matter (e.g. Brumsack, 2006; Tribovillard et al., 2006). Consequently, trace metals have been used in reconstructions of the depositional environment of organic-rich deposits, however most of these studies focused mainly on the redox chemistry of these trace metals. Here we present the results of a comprehensive database that has been constructed for comparing trace metal concentrations in modern organic-rich sediments from a variety of different marine settings. This database allows us to define proxies that effectively differentiate between two fundamentally different settings with enhanced organic-carbon burial: continental margin upwelling areas (e.g. Namibian Margin) and hydrographically restricted marginal marine basins (e.g. Black Sea). It is observed that relatively high Cd/Mo values are typical for samples from upwelling settings whereas Co*Mn values are relatively high in samples from restricted basins. Cd/Mo ratios are thought to reflect the relative influence of productivity versus preservation on organic carbon accumulation, in which high values in productivity driven systems (i.e. upwelling) are attributed to the enhanced transfer of Cd to the sediment by incorporation of Cd into plankton biomass. Co*Mn, on the other hand, might be used to assess circulation patterns and the relative contribution of sub-surface versus surface/river water and/or dust influx to the basin, because of the differences in the supply and reactive behaviour of Co and Mn in the water column. As both independent parameters show similar discriminating behaviour, it is proposed that cross-plotting Cd/Mo and Co*Mn provides a highly effective way to distinguish sediments deposited in upwelling versus restricted settings.",

It occurs in rocks that contain intergranular fluids and may operate in a wide range of temperature, pressure and rock types. Indicative features for the operation of these processes at microscale were studied in the samples of deformed granites that were sheared in the South Armorican Shear Zone, France. Evidences such as truncate grain and phase boundaries of quartz, K-feldspar and white mica via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and evidence of pressure solution activity was observed in phase boundaries between white mica-quartz and white mica-K-feldspar. In the quartz-white mica phase boundaries we have found evidences for the island-and-channel model of Wassmann and Stöckhert (2013). Quartz dissolution along the phase boundaries is crystallographically controlled. The partial dissolution phase boundary is characterized by very rough surface forming triangular, trapezoidal and asymmetric voids that represent channels for fluid migration in the island-and-channel model, while the undisturbed boundary represents islands. These features are confirmed in the 3D nanotomography. When white mica basal plane is not parallel to the phase boundary, amorphous material and mica overgrowing quartz may occur. In white mica-K-feldspar boundaries, amorphous material representing leached K-feldspar at the K-feldspar interface was observed as previously described by Hellmann et al. (2012). Overall the dissolution reprecipitation seems to be complex mechanism that forms significant features in different phases according to respective crystallographic orientation.",

Gaps in detailed mapping of Quaternary deposits and tectonic landforms did not trigger researches on active faults, but after the tragic event.\nWe present a morphotectonic study of geometry and evolution of the activated fault system (Paganica-San Demetrio, PSDFS). The LIDAR analysis and field survey yield to a new geological and structural map of the area with an unprecedented detail for the Quaternary deposits. It shows an alluvial depositional system prograding and migrating due to fault system evolution.\nThe normal faults offset both the Quaternary deposits and the bedrock. The structural analysis allows us to recognize two fault systems: (A) NNE- and WNW-trending conjugate extensional system overprinting a strike-slip kinematics and (B) dip-slip NW-trending system. Crosscut relationship suggests that the activity of system B prevails, since Early Pleistocene, on system A, which earlier may have controlled a differently shaped basin. System B is the main responsible for the present-day compound outline of the Middle Aterno Valley, while system A major splays now act as segment boundaries.\nThe long-term expression of B results in prominent fault scarps offsetting Quaternary deposits, dissecting erosional and depositional flat landforms. We retrieved detailed morphologic throws along fault scarps and we dated landforms by 14C, OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence), CRN (Cosmogenic Radionuclide) and tephra chronology.\nWe show the persistent role of extensional faulting in dominating Quaternary landform evolution and we estimate slip-rate of the PSDFS at different time-scales. The results support repeated activity of PSDFS for ~20 km total length, thus implying M6.6 maximum expected earthquake.\nSuch an approach should have been applied beforehand for the actual hazard estimation, to trigger, early enough, the adoption of precautionary measures against surface faulting events.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convection is the fundamental process by which the Earth expels its internal heat. It is controlled at the microscopic scale by the motion of crystal defects responsable for plastic deformation at high temperature and pressure conditions of the deep Earth. In this study we focus on dislocations which are usually considered as the most efficient defects contributing to intracrystalline deformation.\nThe influence of temperature is a key parameter in determining the behaviour of dislocations. We propose a model to describe the temperature-dependent mobility of dislocations based on a computational materials science approach, connecting the atomic to the grain scale. This provides elementary knowledge to both interpret seismic anisotropy and to improve geodynamic modelling.\nHere we focus on plastic deformation of the transition zone minerals wadsleyite and ringwoodite, dominating the boundary separating the upper from the lower mantle, a region over which the viscosity is thought to increase rapidly.\nUsing the Peierls-Nabarro-Galerkin model enabled us to select potential glide planes, to predict the dislocation core structures and fundamental properties of both Mg2SiO4 high-pressure polymorphs integrating the non-elastic nature of dislocations from atomic scale based calculations. Macroscopic deformation results from the mobility of these distinct dislocations. High finite mantle temperatures activates unstable double-kink configurations on the dislocation line which allow the dislocation to move under stress. The original contribution of the present work is the formulation of a mobility law for dissociated dislocations as they occur in wadsleyite and ringwoodite. This permits us to predict the critical activation enthalpy required to overcome lattice friction associated to the onset of glide. From this, the effective glide velocities can be derived as a function of stress and temperature leading to the first lower bound estimates of transition zone viscosities.\nThese are the first quantifications that bridge the fundamental properties of defects in the transition zone silicates to constraints on plastic anisotropy and ductile flow in the Earth's deep interior.",

This is one of the first airborne experiments to focus on the sources and chemistry of Hg in the atmosphere. The experiment flew 19 research flights on the NCAR C-130 aircraft, based out of Smyrna, TN. The primary Hg goals for NOMADSS were to constrain emissions of Hg over the U.S. and quantify the distribution and chemistry of Gaseous Elemental Mercury (GEM) and Reactive Mercury (RM) in the troposphere. We measured speciated Hg on the C-130 using the UW-Detector of Oxidized HG species (UW-DOHGS). This instrument has been developed over several years and tested/calibrated with several HgX2 compounds and other compounds to examine possible interferences. In its current configuration, the instrument quantitatively measures HgX2 compounds (HgCl2 and HgBr2) with no interference from O3.\nDuring NOMADSS, flight planning was facilitated by use of the NASA GEOS-5 system, which provided forecasts for many relevant tracers. Post-mission analyses are being conducted using the GEOS-Chem Hg model. This provides a key tool to compare current estimates of Hg sources and distribution with aircraft observations.\nWe are using the NOMADSS data for several types of analyses:\nGEM emissions and concentrations in power plant plumes and downwind of urban centers;\nPresence of RM in relatively high concentration in several free tropospheric locations;\nEvaluation and interpretation of the data using the GEOS-Chem Hg model.\nWhile there are a number of important results from NOMADSS, the most striking is the high concentrations of RM GOM in some regions of the upper troposphere, significantly higher than calculated by the standard GEOS-Chem simulation. We believe this is most likely due to halogen oxidation. These results suggest higher halogen concentrations or faster oxidation of GEM and thus a substantial rethinking of Hg oxidation in the global atmosphere.",

The model was calibrated and tested using both in situ point observations and turbidity maps obtained analyzing satellite images.\nOnce calibrated the model can integrate the high temporal resolution of point observations with the high spatial resolution of remote sensing, overcoming the intrinsic limitation of these two types of observations.\nThe model was applied to the specific test case of the Venice lagoon simulating an entire year (2005) which was shown to be a “representative” year for wind and tide characteristics. The time evolution of the computed total bottom shear stresses (BSS) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was analyzed on the basis of a “Peaks Over Threshold” method once a critical value for shear stress and turbidity were chosen. The analyses of the numerical results enabled us to demonstrate that resuspension events can be modeled as marked Poisson processes: interarrival time, intensity of peak excesses and duration being exponentially distributed random variable.\nThe probability distributions of the interarrival time of overthreshold exceedances in both BSS and SSC as well as their intensity and duration can be used in long-term morphodynamic studies to generate synthetic series statistically equivalent to real sequences through which MonteCarlo realizations of relevant morphological evolutions can be computed.",

In particular, we examine if and how the work of LTER science communication practitioners, individuals with the responsibility to communicate, report, or interpret the findings of his/her LTER with any other group, excluding through K-12 educational programs, aligns with theoretically established models of science communication. Broadly speaking, as over two decades of research in science communication attests, these models tend to emphasize the deficit approach, dialogue with and between audiences, and/or audience participation. Does the practitioners’ work fall neatly into these three “ideal type” categories, or do their practices blur the boundaries of established models? Do practitioners appeal to more than one type of model in the course of their work? Is there evidence of hybrid approaches, or other, new models that have not yet been identified in the literature? Participating organizations will be selected from the Long Term Ecological Research Network, an organization of LTERs funded by the National Science Foundation. The LTER network is actively involved in science communication, as shown by the most recent LTER Strategic Communication Plan. Science communicators may be involved in variety of practices, such as creating translational materials for policymakers to better understand the findings of LTERs, developing training courses for conservation professionals, or organizing site tours for journalists or funders. Practitioners will participate in semi-structured interviews covering how their practices relate to established models of science communication, how they view their roles and responsibilities, and how they view their audience(s). This presentation will cover emerging results from ongoing analysis of interviews conducted with a purposive sample of these individuals. The results will help to expand and refine our understanding of how well theoretical models of science communication describe real-world science communication practices, both at a broad level, and specifically within the LTER context.",

            "abstract": "Steep, mountainous rivers draning recently uplifted lithology on high standing islands within the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone export a disproportionately high amount of sediment given their small area; up to 20% of global export in 3% of the total exorheic land area. Typhoons strongly influence climate in this region, leading to increased sediment discharge, hyperpycnal flow, and efficient deposition of terrestrial particulate organic carbon in marine sediments. If this material escapes benthic remineralization – as is expected due to the lack of a continental shelf – typhoon mediated export of plant-derived POC is a net atmospheric CO2 sink.\nHere we report results from high-resolution (~hours) sampling on the LiWu River, Taiwan, during three sequential typhoons in 2008, and re-examine previous soil samples using more in-depth methods. Using a combination of bulk carbon isotopes (δ13C, ∆14C), vascular plant biomarker concentrations and δ13C, and ramped oxidation radiocarbon analysis, we describe the source and age of exported POC over a range of discharge conditions. We show that previous results indicating an increase in biospheric POC export during typhoons is an oversimplification; pre-aged soil OC complicates export. We offer an updated view of steep, mountainous rivers as a negative feedback loop to increased atmospheric CO2 and estimate for the first time the contribution and residence time of pre-aged soil OC in such a system.",

            "abstract": "This study addresses the following two important science questions: 1) “Have long term trends in landscape change modified the inland patterns of ARs that are responsible for occurrence of storms and flooding in the western US?”, and 2) “What are the relative sensitivities of landscape modifications, particularly in the form of human-induced land-use/land cover (LULC) change, on the synoptic and inland patterns of atmospheric river (AR) events?” The first question was addressed through observational analysis of AR-related storms that occurred from 1970 to 2000. Thirty years (1970-2000) of daily precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) were analyzed to obtain the highest intensity storm event for each decade. For each station and decade, anomalies of precipitable water and integrated vapor transport (IVT) were evaluated as first-hand indicators of the interdecadal synoptic structure and inland propagation of ARs. The results of the study indicated that, large and extensive precipitable water anomaly was observed in the latest decade (the 1990’s) that penetrated deep to the leeward sides of the Cascades and Sierras. The second question was addressed through simulations of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS, version 6.2) on predefined LULC scenarios that covered portions of western U.S. The established LULC scenarios were intentionally formulated to represent the natural undisturbed landscape and the contemporary landscape as a control. AR duration, AR frequency, IVT-differences and synoptic anomalies have been evaluated in coarser (Grid-1) and finer (Grid-2) grids as essential indicators of the LULC-induced modification in AR hydrometeorology. Our RAMS simulations indicated that the contemporary LULC scenario represented by the control exhibited an increase in the mean AR duration (by over 5hrs) and frequency (by over 10%) as compared to the undisturbed scenario. IVT differences between control and undisturbed scenarios reached up to 200kg m-1 s-1 at the time of maximum precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The importance of freshwater discharge from glaciers and ice sheets along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is now evident, but quantifying the source of freshwater inputs (e.g., calving, ice sheet basal melt, and/or subglacial flow) directly and the associated constituent fluxes have been limited. The mode of freshwater contribution in glacier marine environments can be important to understanding glacial melt dynamics related to climate change and overall influences on the coastal ecosystem. As part of an NSF funded project, we are attempting to quantify for the first time using land-based measurements the rate of freshwater input and the associated flux of nutrients and iron to the coastal waters of the WAP, and the mixing of these constituents across the continental shelf. This research is combining geophysical measurements with established radio- (radium quartet and 222Rn) and stable tracer (18O and 2H) techniques to quantify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), particularly the freshwater contributions, to the coast and delineate the source of water and dissolved constituents.\nNearshore surface water and end member (e.g., streams, groundwater, etc.) tracer data suggest a means of discerning the source of freshwater, with up to 50% of freshwater input from subsurface flow. Time series tracer data in combination with electrical resistivity measurements provide clear observations of SGD and provide insights into tidal influences and the rapid response of subsurface fluid interactions. More broadly, 223Ra and 224Ra activities are elevated in porewaters and glacial meltwaters and decreased in surface water with distance from shore. A preliminary mass balance model estimates SGD at approximately 200 m3 d-1 per m of shoreline during austral summer, comparable to temperate environments.\nAcross the shelf, surface water tracer concentrations suggest rapid cross-shelf mixing (730-14000 m2s-1) that could increase delivery of nearshore freshwater and dissolved constituents further afield. Primary production in iron-limited waters offshore of the WAP is believed to be fueled by continentally-derived sediments. Based on these measurements, SGD could potentially be an important and unaccounted source of iron to continental shelf waters.",

            "abstract": "As renewable energy system become more prevalent, improved global long-term, up-to-date records are needed to better understand and quantify the solar resource and variability. Toward this end, a project involving NASA, DOE NREL, SUNY-Albany and the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) was initiated to provide NREL with a solar resource mapping production system for improved depiction of global long-term solar resources that provides the capacity for continual updates. This new production system is made possible by the efforts of NOAA and NASA to completely reprocess the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data set that provides satellite visible and infrared radiances together with retrieved cloud and surface properties on a 3-hourly basis beginning from July 1983 at an effective 10 km resolution. Thus, working with SUNY and NCDC, NASA will develop and test an improved production system that will yield an operational production system for NREL to continually update the Earth’s solar resource. In this presentation, we provide a general overview of this project together with samples of the new solar irradiance mapped data products and comparisons to surface measurements at various locations across the world. Here, a three-year prototype of the anticipated ISCCP data set called GridSat is used to assess the algorithms and demonstrate the production system. GridSat maps together cross-calibrated visible and IR reflectances from all the world’s geosynchronous satellites at 10 km and 3-hourly respectively. The results are shown and discussed in comparison to existing solar data products. Additionally, the solar irradiance values are compared to various Baseline Surface Radiation Network surface site measurements and other high quality surface measurements. The statistics of the agreement between the measurements and new satellite estimates are also reviewed. The team is now testing a beta release of the revised ISCCP data set through the NOAA NCDC. This data set also includes the cross-calibrated AVHRR polar orbiter imager measurements that will allow a true global coverage.  Lastly, we will identify the next steps in the production of the data set including some accuracy goals as the current production system is adapted to the new ISCCP data products.",

            "abstract": "A newly discovered and highly active seepage area has been acoustically mapped at the western edge of the Aquitaine Shelf in the Bay of Biscay [\nDupré et al., 2014\n].\nThree selected seeping sites have been investigated with a Remotely Operated Vehicle. All sites were characterized by vigorous gas emissions, and the occurrence of massive carbonate crusts and bacterial mats at the seafloor. Nine seeps have been sampled with the PEGAZ sampler. The latter allowed gas-bubble sampling and preservation at in situpressure, together with gas-flux measurement through its graduated transparent cone.\nThe C2+ fraction of the gas samples accounts for less than 0.06 %-mol of the total composition. Both the abundance of methane and dD and d13C isotopic analyses of the hydrocarbons indicate a biogenic source generated by microbial reduction of carbon dioxide [Whiticar et al., 1986]. The analyses of the associated noble gases also provide further support for a shallow-depth generation. While sharing the same origin, the collected samples are different in other respects, such as the measured d13C values for carbon dioxide and the hydrocarbons. This is the case in particular for methane, with displays values in between -66.1 and -72.7 ‰. We hypothesized that such variations are the result of multiple gas-transport processes along with the occurrence of hydrocarbon oxidation at different rates within the sedimentary column. The measured gas fluxes are extremely heterogeneous from one seep to another, ranging from 18 to 193 m3.yr-1. These values will be discussed in detail by comparing them with values obtained from different measurement techniques at other gas-seeping sites.\nThe GAZCOGNE study is co-funded by TOTAL and IFREMER as part of the PAMELA (Passive Margin Exploration Laboratories) scientific project.\n",

            "abstract": "During recent decades, Northern Eurasia was affected by unprecedented climate and environmental changes. Several droughts and heat waves alternated with hazardous extreme precipitation and flood events. Permafrost thaw, retreating Arctic sea ice, increasing areas of forest fire, and dramatic regional warming buffeted this region, tossing northern Eurasia from one extreme condition to the next. The region stores nearly half of the Earth’s terrestrial carbon in permafrost, wetlands, and forested land, so ecosystem changes that release stored carbon could profoundly affect the world’s climate. Furthermore, changes to climate and to hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are starting to affect daily life. For example, infrastructure is collapsing as permafrost thaws, severe winter storms increasingly bring businesses to a halt, and a growing water deficit is beginning to strain agricultural production and forestry. To pool resources and facilitate research, the Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI,\nhttp://neespi.org\n) was launched in 2004. With its multidisciplinary focus, the internationally funded NEESPI (more than165 individual international projects during the past decade) has challenged participants to research climate-ecosystem interactions, societal impacts from extreme events in Northern Eurasia, and the feedbacks of these interactions and impacts to the global Earth system. Among the numerous Institutional and private sponsors from the United States, European Union, Russia, China, and Japan, the cornerstone support for the NEESPI studies was provided by the NASA Land Cover and Land Use Change Program and the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nAt this presentation we shall overview the environmental studies conducted by the NEESPI community, brief the audience about the main achievements of the NEESPI researchers, and lay down the plans for the future studies. At the side event of the Meeting, we are going to initiate preparation of the book which will synthesize major NEESPI achievements.",

These workshops have been held across the country for the past five years, in places underserved with respect to NASA workshops and at LRO team member institutions. MarsFest is a planetary analog festival that has been held annually in Death Valley National Park since 2012, made possible with support from the Curiosity (primarily the Sample Analysis at Mars) Education and Public Outreach team, NASA’s Ames Research Center, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the SETI Institute, and Death Valley National Park. Both the Lunar Workshops for Educators and MarsFest rely strongly on scientist engagement for their success. In the Lunar Workshops, scientists and engineers give talks for workshop participants, support facility tours and field trips, and, where possible, have lunch with the teachers to interact with them in a less formal setting. Teachers have enthusiastically appreciated and benefited from all of these interactions, and the scientists and engineers also provide positive feedback about their involvement. In MarsFest, scientists and engineers give public presentations and take park visitors on field trips to planetary analog sites. The trips are led by scientists who do research at the field trip sites whenever possible. Surveys of festival participants indicate an appreciation for learning about scientific research being conducted in the park from the people involved in that research, and scientists and engineers report enjoying sharing their work with the public through this program. The key to effective scientist engagement in all of the workshops and festivals has been a close relationship and open communication between the scientists and engineers and the activity facilitators. I will provide more details about both of these programs, how scientists and engineers are involved in them, and offer suggestions for others who would like to engage scientists and engineers in similar activities.",

            "abstract": "In paleoclimate and geodynamic studies large endorheic drainage basins generally provide long-term archives of hydro-climatological and tectonic changes including a transient topography. Sediment cascades from sources to sinks are playing a scale-depending role in the reconstruction of process dynamics by using sedimentary records.\nWe present a holistic study on the Hei He drainage basin at the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau by combining multi-disciplinary and multi-site approaches. The drainage system is crossing margins of extreme climatic conditions from the glaciated and permafrost sources within the >5000m high Qilian Shan to the hyper-arid Ejina Basin as endorheic sink with a catchment size of ca. 180,000 km2 and a endorheic basin area of approx. 28,000 km2. Two 230 m long drill-cores at the depocenter of Ejina basin recover a sedimentation history of about 250,000 years and integrate at least two glacial-interglacial cycles of climate change and a considerable geodynamic within the second largest strike-slip system in the world.\nSedimentation rate/subsidence estimations with consideration of climate-induced hydrological changes affecting the wider study and sink area provided data on the mountain uplift/basin development and the effects of tectonically induced changes of the drainage system. Based on 15 paleohydrological records covering the last ca. 35,000 years corroborated by >75 14C AMS data, we can demonstrate that water divides have been spatially variable with temporal opening of the endorheic system. Thus, small-scale changes in topography are able to explain extreme changes of sedimentation rates within long-term records in the depocenter.\nThe major fault systems in the drainage centers intensely modified the drainage system and catchment size resulting in extreme hydrological changes in the basin as recorded in the long-cores. A brief view into the Okavango system in Botswana indicates that the complexity of interrelated non-climatic processes of huge drainage basins crossing large fault systems and climate zones is not unique.",

This presentation will focus on two new such architectures: USGS’s Science Data Catalog (SDC) and DOE’s Next Generation Ecological Experiments – Arctic Data System.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a Science Data Catalog (data.usgs.gov) to include records describing datasets, data collections, and observational or remotely-sensed data. The system was built using service oriented architecture and allows USGS scientists and data providers to create and register their data using either a standards-based metadata creation form or simply to register their already-created metadata records with the USGS SDC Dashboard. This dashboard then compiles the harvested metadata records and sends them to the post processing and indexing service using the JSON format. The post processing service, with the help of various ontologies and other geo-spatial validation services, auto-enhances these harvested metadata records and creates a Lucene index using the Solr enterprise search platform. Ultimately, metadata is made available via the SDC search interface.\nDOE’s Next Generation Ecological Experiments (NGEE) Arctic project deployed a data system that allows scientists to prepare, publish, archive, and distribute data from field collections, lab experiments, sensors, and simulated modal outputs. This architecture includes a metadata registration form, data uploading and sharing tool, a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) tool, a Drupal based content management tool (http://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov), and a data search and access tool based on ORNL’s Mercury software (http://mercury.ornl.gov).

Using storm surge flooding from various historical hurricanes, simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic wave model (ADCIRC-SWAN), we propose an integrated framework yielding a geospatial identification of the capacity of Chesapeake Bay wetlands to protect critical infrastructure. Spatial identification of Chesapeake Bay wetlands is derived from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). Inventories of population and critical infrastructure are extracted from US Census block data and FEMA’s HAZUS-Multi Hazard geodatabase. Geospatial and statistical analyses are carried out to develop a relationship between wetland land cover, hurricane flooding, population and infrastructure vulnerability. These analyses result in the identification and quantification of populations and infrastructure in flooded areas that lie within a reasonable buffer surrounding the identified wetlands. Our analysis thus produces a spatial perspective on the potential for wetlands to attenuate hurricane flood impacts in critical areas. Statistical analysis will support hypothesis testing to evaluate the benefits of wetlands from a flooding and storm-surge attenuation perspective. Results from geospatial analysis are used to identify where interactions with critical infrastructure are relevant in the Chesapeake Bay.",

            "abstract": "The reconstruction of eruptive processes from ejecta deposits is a vital element of volcano hazard assessment. Large-scale experiments provide an opportunity to test ejecta distribution and volume to energy and depth parameters for discrete blasts. Experiments conducted at the University at Buffalo Geohazards Field Station produced meter-scale craters with ejecta deposits. Repeated chemical explosions occurred in constructed strata of compacted aggregates (e.g. sands, gravels) with variable configurations. The experiments revealed that shallow blasts, low scaled depth (<0.004 m/J1/3), are required to produce significant extra-crater deposits. Sixteen discrete blasts produced ejecta between 5 -18 m from the blast center (> 2x crater radius). Each experiment had between one and four explosions in the same horizontal positions (pad), with variable charge depth and energy. The extra-crater deposits were collected up to 18 m from the blast center. Ejecta produced by discrete explosions can be divided into three zones: proximal, medial and distal. The proximal deposits form a constructional feature around the crater. Medial ejecta forms a thin continuous blanket and distal ejecta consists of isolated clasts scattered beyond the medial blanket. A strong relationship between the shape of the jet produced by shallow blasts and the distribution of ejecta were reproduced through the multiple experiments. The jet shape is controlled by crater geometry and condition. Therefore, crater geometry and condition influences ejecta distribution. Blasts that interact with an existing crater have more vertically focused jets. The elevation of the crater rim, enhanced by proximal deposits, contributes to future depositional patterns by producing confined jets. Small discrete blasts frequently have >50% of their volume in the proximal zone. These experiments show that deposit distribution is sensitive to surface geometries in addition to the energy and depth of the blast.",

            "abstract": "Some current estimates of GPS velocity uncertainties for continuous stations with more than a decade of data can be very low, < 0.1 mm per year. Yet, velocities with respect to rigid plates can be an order of magnitude larger, even in nominally stable plate interiors. This could be caused by underestimating low frequency, time-dependent noise, such as random walk. Traditional estimators, based on individual time series, are insensitive to low amplitude random walk, yet such noise significantly increases GPS velocity uncertainties.\nWe develop a new approach to estimating noise in GPS time series, focusing on areas where the signal in the data is well characterized. We analyze data from the seismically inactive parts of central US. The data is decomposed into signal, plate rotation and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), and various noise components. Our method processes multiple stations simultaneously with a Kalman Filter, and estimates average noise components for the network by maximum likelihood. Currently, we model white noise, flicker noise and random walk. Synthetic tests show that this approach correctly estimates the velocity uncertainty by determining a good estimate of random walk variance, even when it is too small to be correctly estimated by traditional approaches.\nWe present preliminary results from a network of 15 GPS stations in the central USA. The data is in a North America fixed reference frame, we subtract seasonal components and GIA displacements used in the SNARF model. Hence, all data in this reference frame is treated as noise. We estimate random walk of 0.82 mm/yr0.5, flicker noise of 3.96 mm/yr0.25 and white noise of 1.05 mm. From these noise parameters the estimated velocity uncertainty is 0.29 mm/yr for 10 years of daily data. This uncertainty is significantly greater than estimated by the traditional methods, at 0.12 mm/yr. The estimated uncertainty is still less than the median residual velocity in the North America fixed reference frame, which could indicate that the true uncertainties are even larger.\nAdditionally we estimated noise parameters and velocity uncertainties for the vertical component and for the data with common-mode signal removed. We are planning to extend this work by processing larger networks.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, enrollment in Northern Arizona University’s (NAU) Geologic Disasters (GLG112) class has grown to its current 840 students in 7 sections per semester (4% of NAU enrollment). Given this large audience composed of >50% freshmen, the course curriculum was re-designed in 2012 using standards set by NAU’s First Year Learning Initiative (FYLI), which seeks to increase academic success early in college. FYLI pedagogical principles include active-learning, frequent feedback, low-stakes assessments, and increased guidance from professors & peer teaching assistants (PTAs). As a result of the successes measured in FYLI courses, we launched a FYLI study abroad experience in 2014. We posed the question, “How can an early-career study abroad experience further develop the attitudes, skills, & behaviors necessary for success?” The pioneering program was NAU in Greece: The Cataclysmic Eruption of Santorini Volcano. Enrollment was limited to freshman & sophomore students who have taken GLG112 (or equivalent). The 3-week program took 9 students, 1 PTA, & 1 faculty member to Santorini (via Athens, 2 days). A detailed itinerary addressed a set of disciplinary & non-disciplinary learning outcomes. Student learning about Santorini volcano and the tectonic setting & hazards of the Aegean Sea occurred on the go – on ferries & private boat trips and during hiking, snorkeling, and swimming. Classroom time was limited to 1 hr/day and frequent assessments were employed. Student products included a geologic field notebook, travel journal, and 3 blog posts pertaining to geologic hazards & life on Santorini. Geologic disasters are ideal topics for early career study abroad experiences because the curriculum is place-based. Student learning benefits immensely from interacting with the land & local populations, whose lives are affected daily by the dangers of living in such geologically hazardous environments. The needs of early career students are unique, however, and must be addressed while planning. Planning should consider (1) location & lodging choices, (2) number of places visited, (3) group travel, (4) behavioral standards, (5) methods of early and frequent feedback, (6) timing, number, & style of assessments and writing assignments, and (7) multi-tiered instructional methods.",

            "abstract": "Kīlauea's upper east rift zone (UERZ) extends ~3 km southeastward from the summit caldera to the Koaʻe fault system, where it starts to bend into the main part of the ENE-trending rift zone. The UERZ lacks a distinct positive gravity anomaly (though coverage is poor) and any evidence of deformation associated with magma intrusion. All ground ruptures—and the Puhimau thermal area—trend ENE, crossing the UERZ at a high angle. Lua Manu, Puhimau, and Koʻokoʻolau craters are the only surface evidence of the UERZ. Yet the UERZ is seismically active, and all magma entering the rest of the rift zone must pass through it. Rather than a rift zone in the traditional sense, with abundant dikes and ground ruptures along its trend, the UERZ cuts across the ENE structural grain and serves only as a connector to the rest of the rift zone, not a locus of dike formation along its length. The UERZ probably developed as a consequence of gradual SSE migration of the active part of the main east rift zone at the trailing edge of the south flank. During migration, a connection to the summit reservoir complex must be maintained; otherwise, the middle and lower east rift zone would starve and magma from Kīlauea's summit reservoir complex would have to go elsewhere. Over time, the UERZ lengthened and rotated clockwise to maintain the connection. Near the caldera, the UERZ may be widening westward as the summit reservoir complex migrates southward from the center of the caldera to its present position. A layered stress regime results in the upper 2–3 km mimicking the pervasive ENE structural grain of most of Kīlauea, whereas the underlying magmatic part of the UERZ responds to stresses related to SE magma transport. Magma intruding upward from the connector forms a dike that follows the ENE structural grain, as during the 1974 eruption. The active east rift zone has been migrating since ~100 ka, estimated by applying a 700-y extension rate across the Koa‘e fault system to the ~6.5 km of migration, and presumably the UERZ connector has been developing during this time.",

            "abstract": "The Eddy-diffusivity/Mass-flux (EDMF) parameterization has been extremely successful in simulating the evolution of terrestrial atmospheric boundary layers. It is particularly suited for representing strong and moderate convection, where turbulence organizes in coherent structures and transports heat, humidity and pollution throughout the extent of the boundary layer. The EDMF’s ability to explicitly represent turbulent updrafts and associated fluxes is key to a proper depiction of the thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere. It is the most appropriate tool currently available to address the outstanding issues in the Mars atmosphere and dust modeling on a global and regional scale. Dust is one of the most important moderators of the Martian climate. Basic theoretical arguments and observations such as high-altitude dust maxima, dust layering, and transport in plumes during dust storm onset—none of which are currently captured in general circulation models (GCMs)—all demonstrate the vital importance of representing dust vertical mixing by plumes. Most GCMs, however, only consider local, Mellor-Yamada-type diffusion, which is insufficient to capture the evolving dust distribution and hence the Martian climate system correctly.\nHere, we developed an EDMF parameterization for the Martian convective boundary layer. We report on details of the parameterization and its performance as compared against large-eddy simulations. We investigate a downdraft contribution to turbulent fluxes and the importance of mass-flux transport of TKE. Furthermore, we investigate the role of plume heating—through absorption of solar radiation by uplifted dust particles—on the plume evolution (a mechanisms that could act as a surrogate of the latent heat release in terrestrial clouds). Our results shed light on the reasons behind the presence of elevated dust layers in the Martian atmosphere.",

Understanding of sheaths is important for understanding planetary surface processes, dust charging and transport, as well as in-situ measurements and exploration. Sheath formation can be complicated. Fundamentally, there are three kinds: classical (ion-dominated), space-charge-limited or SCL (non-monotonic), and inverse (electron-dominated). All the three kinds of sheaths can, in general, exist above the surface of small bodies that both collect (e.g., solar wind plasma) and emit (e.g., photoelectrons and secondary electrons) charged particles. For the first time, we do laboratory experiments to show the emergence of all these sheaths by changing a single parameter: the ratio of emitted to collected electron currents. In the experiments, plasma is created using a hot filament to emit energetic primary electrons to ionize neutral particles. Secondary electrons are also created from a surface where the primary electrons bombard. By changing the neutral pressure, the thermal electron density is changed from higher to lower than the secondary electron density, showing a change in sheath structure from classical through SCL to inverse profiles. We investigate the conditions for the formation of these sheathes and their properties.",

A more direct source of northern hemisphere [NH] ice history comes from central Arctic Ocean (CAO) submarine ridges (Northwind, Mendeleev, Lomonosov) where, at orbital timescales, sedimentation is controlled by the growth and decay of ice sheets, ice shelves, and sea ice. Calcareous microfossil density in CAO sediments is one of many proxies, such as manganese concentrations, grain size, bulk density, color, mineral content, organic geochemistry, and foraminiferal δ18O, that reveal GIC changes in ice cover, biological productivity, and primary and post-depositional sediment processes. In order to better understand NH ice history, we constructed 600-kyr-long stacked records of Arctic foraminiferal and ostracode density (AFD, AOD) from 19 CAO sediment cores following stacking and astronomical tuning procedures used for deep-sea δ18Of curves. Results show discrepancies between the Arctic AFD and AOD curves, the LR04 δ18Of stack (Lisiecki and Raymo 2005, Paleoceanography), the Red Sea and Mediterranean δ18Of sea level curves (Rohling et al. 2014 Nature), and modeled Antarctic Ice Sheet volume, suggesting asynchronous polar ice sheet behavior in the two hemispheres, notably during MIS 3, 5a, 5c, 7d, and 11.",

The synergy between space-borne observations and high-resolution simulation is investigated through a series of large-eddy simulations (LES) that are based on A-Train observations of marine cloudy boundary layers. The main aims of the study are to advance the understanding of the atmospheric boundary layer physics and increase the utility of both observations and modeling. Using a combination of multi-sensor A-train data and model reanalysis, high resolution, cloud regime-type large-eddy simulations of selected scenes are carried out. For instance, temperature, humidity profiles and sea surface temperature from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and geostrophic wind from reanalysis are used in the LES. Although the AIRS soundings lack fine structure in the boundary layer and often exhibit small deviations from the actual atmospheric state, the simulations show that a more precise profile can be obtained. The quantitative characteristics of the cloud structure are used to compare the LES results with reflectances from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Implications related to the dynamics of the boundary layer and its modeling in global models are also discussed.",

By developing Middle East Dust Index (MEDI) and applying to 70 dust storms characterized on MODIS images and occurred during the period between 2001 and 2012, we herein present a new high resolution mapping of major atmospheric dust source points participating in this region. To assist environmental managers and decision maker in taking proper and prioritized measures, we then categorize identified sources in terms of intensity based on extracted indices for Deep Blue algorithm and also utilize frequency of occurrence approach to find the sensitive sources. In next step, by implementing the spectral mixture analysis on the Landsat TM images (1984 and 2012), a novel desertification map will be presented. The aim is to understand how human perturbations and land-use change have influenced the dust storm points in the region. Preliminary results of this study indicate for the first time that c.a., 39 % of all detected source points are located in this newly anthropogenically desertified area. A large number of low frequency sources are located within or close to the newly desertified areas. These severely desertified regions require immediate concern at a global scale. During next 6 months, further research will be performed to confirm these preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of whistler turbulence in a magnetized, homogeneous, collisionless plasma have been carried out to study the consequent heating of both electrons and ions. An initial relatively isotropic spectrum of long-wavelength whistler mode fluctuations is imposed upon the system. The simulations follow the temporal evolution of the field fluctuations as they decay via a forward cascade into a broadband, turbulent spectrum at shorter wavelengths with an anisotropy in the sense of stronger fluctuation energy at k||, where the subscripts denote directions relative to the background magnetic field. As in previous whistler turbulence PIC simulations, electrons are heated with T||e >> Tperp,e.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are long, narrow, intense, and evolving filamentary structures responsible for transporting significant amounts of moisture from the tropics to mid-latitudes and are often associated with extreme winter-time precipitation for regions such as the West Coast of the United States. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) captures these synoptic scale structures as well as their extreme precipitation. The CESM version employed utilizes high resolution atmosphere/land components (0.5o) coupled to the standard (1o) ocean/ice components. The high resolution atmosphere is able to more accurately represent extreme, regional precipitation.\nCataloguing AR events in long-term climate simulations where centuries of data are produced requires an automated AR-identification algorithm that captures the spatial and temporal structures of these events. These algorithms may vary in complexity but all necessitate the inclusion of water vapor content thresholds. The adoption of observationally based empirical threshold values may not translate well to future climate projections as increased temperatures change the background water vapor content (Clausius-Clapeyron relationship).\nHere, we evaluate spatial and temporal characteristics of Western U.S. ARs in CESM and compare them to observations. A variety of threshold definitions will be discussed which span observationally based values of water vapor content to values relative to the background state (more appropriate for future climate). Model simulated extreme precipitation related to AR’s and results from the RCP8.5 future climate scenario will be shown.",

Despite its predominantly rural nature, the Upper Peninsula has a history of industrial\nPCB use. PCB congener concentrations in fish vary 50-fold in Upper Peninsula lakes. Several factors may\ncontribute to this high variability including local point sources, unique watershed and lake\ncharacteristics, and food web structure. It was hypothesized that the variability in congener distributions\ncould be used to identify factors controlling concentrations in fish, and then to use those factors to\npredict PCB contamination in fish from lakes that had not been monitored. Watershed and lake\ncharacteristics were acquired from several databases for 16 lakes sampled in the State’s fish\ncontaminant survey. Species congener distributions were compared using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to distinguish between lakes with local vs. regional, atmospheric sources; six lakes were predicted\nto have local sources and half of those have confirmed local PCB use. For lakes without local PCB\nsources, PCA indicated that lake size was the primary factor influencing PCB concentrations. The EPA’s\nbioaccumulation model, BASS, was used to predict PCB contamination in lakes without local sources as a\nfunction of food web characteristics. The model was used to evaluate the hypothesis that deep,\noligotrophic lakes have longer food webs and higher PCB concentrations in top predator fish. Based on\nthese findings, we will develop a mechanistic watershed-lake model to predict PCB concentrations in\nfish as a function of atmospheric PCB concentrations, lake size, and trophic state. Future atmospheric\nconcentrations, predicted by modeling potential primary and secondary emission scenarios, will be used\nto predict the time horizon for safe fish consumption.",

Yet there is substantial inter-annual variability (IAV) in the number of days that exceed the O3 air quality threshold (currently 75 ppbv for an 8-hour average). We propose that wildfires are the dominant cause for this IAV. However there are large uncertainties around O3 production from wildfires due to numerous complicating factors. Ozone formation in wildfire plumes differs substantially from urban O3 production in several ways: substantial variations in the emissions, much larger aerosol loadings, a much greater variety of reactive and oxygenated VOCs, rapid and substantial formation of PAN and very different sources of HOx in the plume. These factors make it challenging to model wildfire impacts on photochemistry in the usual way.\nIn this presentation we will show examples of three common situations based on data from the Mt. Bachelor Observatory:\nRapid O3 formation (within one day) in a wildfire plume.\nSlow, but substantial, O3 formation (over days to a week) in a wildfire plume.\nNo detectable O3 formation in a wildfire plume.\nWe will interpret these results with respect to the observed NOy mixing ratios, the photochemical environment, the combustion efficiency, the plume transport and other factors and suggest some key experiments and modeling studies that can help further our understanding of wildfire O3 production.",

The accuracy of individual sea level reconstructions is limited by measurement, noise, local variations in salinity and temperature, and the assumptions particular to each reconstruction. To address these limitations, we have created a sea level stack (average) which increases the signal-to-noise ratio of sea level estimates by combining 5-7 sea level reconstructions over the last 800 kyr. Principal Component analysis (PCA) of seven sea level records from 0-430 kyr ago shows that 82% of the variance in these records is explained by their first principal component (i.e., the stack). Additionally, a stack of just the 5 longer records that extends to 800 kyr closely matches the timing and amplitude of our seven-record mean. We find that the mean sea level estimate for Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e is 0-4 m above modern, and that the standard deviation of individual estimates is 11 m. Mean sea level estimates for MIS 11 are 12-16 m above modern with a standard deviation of 30 m. Due to the large variability between individual reconstructions, our sea level stack may provide more robust sea level estimates than any single technique.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate trends in streams often do not match expectations based on recent nitrogen source loadings to the land surface. Groundwater discharge with long travel times has been suggested as the likely cause for these observations. The fate of nitrate in groundwater depends to a large extent on the occurrence of denitrification along flow paths. Because denitrification in groundwater is inhibited when dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are high, defining the oxic-suboxic interface has been critical in determining pathways for nitrate transport in groundwater and to streams at the local scale. Predicting redox conditions on a regional scale is complicated by the spatial variability of reaction rates. In this study, logistic regression and boosted classification tree analysis were used to predict the probability of oxic water in groundwater in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The probability of oxic water (DO > 2 mg/L) was predicted by relating DO concentrations in over 3,000 groundwater samples to indicators of residence time and/or electron donor availability. Variables that describe position in the flow system (e.g., depth to top of the open interval), soil drainage and surficial geology were the most important predictors of oxic water. Logistic regression and boosted classification tree analysis correctly predicted the presence or absence of oxic conditions in over 75 % of the samples in both training and validation data sets. Predictions of the percentages of oxic wells in deciles of risk were very accurate (r2>0.9) in both the training and validation data sets. Depth to the bottom of the oxic layer was predicted and is being used to estimate the effect that groundwater denitrification has on stream nitrate concentrations and the time lag between the application of nitrogen at the land surface and its effect on streams.",

            "abstract": "Recent efforts to constrain the thermal evolution of the Martian lithosphere suggest that the ratio of mantle heat production to heat loss, termed the Urey ratio, on Mars may be greater than unity at present (or in Mars' recent past). For comparison, the present day Earth value is 0.33. These estimates fly in the face of conventional wisdom that a smaller planet like Mars should have cooled faster than the Earth - and certainly should not be heating up at present. We perform a sensitivity analysis, using a thermal history modeling approach, to asses the relative effects of changing planetary size, mode of tectonics, and nature of deep volatile cycling (focussing on water). Our results indicate that differences in the nature of volatile cycling (degassing vs regassing over time) can outweigh the effects of size and tectonic mode in determining the thermal state of a planet. Mars models in which degassing dominates can give Urey ratios that exceed unity. Earth models in which regassing dominates over degassing in the later geologic stages of evolution lead to lower Urey ratio values.",

While the range of proposed models encompasses most Pmax-T, most models are 200-400°C too cold. In general, discrepancies are greatest for Pmax < 2 GPa where only a few of the highest-T modeled paths overlap petrologic observations. Comparison among published models suggests several possible explanations for these differences. Variables that affect temperatures within the subduction zone include the timing of subduction initiation relative to metamorphism, age of the subducting oceanic crust, rate of convergence, and the dip angle of the subducting plate. An additional factor is whether subducted material is constrained to move coherently with the incoming plate or whether it convects within the plate interface. Higher temperatures are predicted for relatively young subducting crust, slow convergence rates, and shallow subduction dips. Simulations in which material from the subducted slab decouples from the slab and rises buoyantly into an overlying weak layer (e.g. hydrated mantle) also result in higher temperatures for exhumed oceanic crust. Our compilation and comparison suggest either that most models are missing one or more important controls on heat sources and heat transfer or that exhumed blueschists and eclogites are more buoyant than typical subducted rocks.",

            "abstract": "Comprehensive climate impacts assessments are important vehicles for conveying salient information to the public and policy makers. However, over the last few decades communication of this important information has been hampered for a number of reasons. Firstly, we have a rapidly changing social media landscape, where there are fewer opportunities for in-depth treatment of issues. To compete in this arena, climate information needs to be packaged in sound bites, and much of the nuance and complexity may be lost. Secondly, scientific literacy among the general U.S. population is not particularly high, which creates a barrier to understanding and limits the audiences that can be reached. Thirdly, climate science has been undermined by misinformation over many years often funded by fossil fuel interests. While this latter obstacle is clearly diminishing - largely in the face of evidence from the undeniable climate impacts that are already being seen by communities - there has been much confusion generated to date.\nDespite the fact that 97% of active climate scientists agree that the planet is warming as a result of human greenhouse gas emission, only 42% of the U.S. population agrees (Pew Research, 2013).\nIn the face of these challenges, much of the work that the Union of Concerned Scientists does to translate climate impacts assessments has shifted to visuals, animations, and videos that people can relate to and connect with more readily. In this session we will share some of the general design features, discuss target audiences, and outline production limitations of several local stories involving videos and animations, as well as present some recent infographics. One example of this work are case studies that focus on sea level rise and involve a local personality who can speak to climate impacts at the community level. We understand the power of visual images and stories in creating messages that stick, and we use this in designing animations that explain the technical findings of climate impacts assessments. We aim to provide the public and policy makers with accessible information to encourage responsible choices regarding both mitigation and adaptation choices to deal with climate change.\nAll of our material is freely available for use from our website - www.ucsusa.org.",

During a nanomineralogy investigation of the Zagami meteorite, which is a heavily shocked Martian basaltic shergottite that fell at Zagami, Nigeria in 1962, we identified the new shock-induced high-pressure mineral liebermannite (KAlSi3O8 with a I4/m hollandite-type structure). The Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association approved both the mineral and its name. The name honors Robert C. Liebermann, a geophysicist at Stony Brook University, for his fundamental contributions to high-pressure mineral physics research. Liebermannite is the K-analog of lingunite (NaAlSi3O8 with a I4/m hollandite-type structure). It has an empirical formula for the type material of (K0.76Na0.14Ca0.02)Al1.03Si3.00O8, based on 8 O atoms pfu, and it occurs as aggregates of crystals up to 15 microns across. The Zagami liebermannite contacts one or more of augite (phenocrysts), plagioclase-composition glass, a silica phase (likely stishovite), ilmenite, baddeleyite, tuite, and merrillite. In one occurrence, lingunite is also present and presents sharp contacts with the liebermannite. Liebermannite formed in Zagami during a shock event that transformed a precursor alkali-feldspar to a high-pressure form. Liebermannite is stable between ~10 and 20-30 GPa; it melts congruently at high temperature and transforms to an I2/m phase at higher pressures. Liebermannite is, therefore, a potentially important indicator of shock conditions in Martian meteorites. Liebermanite may also occur in subducted sediments within the Earth’s upper mantle and may, therefore, be an important factor in the thermal evolution of the Earth in its role as a repository of 40K.",

            "abstract": "The Eramosa River located within the Grand River Watershed in Ontario, Canada, resides upon a densely fractured dolostone aquifer with abundant dissolution-enhanced channel features. While the bedrock aquifer represents a major component of the total water supply for the surrounding region, potential effects of increased groundwater extraction on surface water and surrounding ecosystems are not yet fully understood. In general, little is known about the nature of the interaction between surface water and groundwater along densely fractured sedimentary bedrock riverbeds. For instance, the timing and magnitude of groundwater discharge to surface water and surface water recharge in a fractured carbonate rock environment is expected to differ significantly from its alluvial channel analogs due to the presence of highly transmissive, planar and strongly orientated discrete fracture features that control flow. Non-invasive geophysical methods represent an opportunity to evaluate shallow groundwater dynamics with minimal environmental risk to biota and, ultimately enhance the interpretation of direct hydrogeologic data.\nPreliminary spatial electrical conductivity measurements collected along a 200 m reach of the river, suggests a seasonally dynamic hyporheic response over a riffle-pool sequence. Based on these results, time-lapse electrical resistivity measurements are being collected every 2-3 weeks along two ~50 m transects perpendicular to the river: the first transect considers changes across an intact bedrock section with exposed vertical and horizontal fracturing along the riverbed, while the second is positioned across a weathered bedrock section with a thin layer of course gravel and sand alluvium. The objective of this study is to collect electrical resistivity snapshots across the riverbed (6-8 m depths) to non-invasively quantify temporal and spatial changes in groundwater-surface water mixing from low to high-stage periods through multiple seasonal cycles. These geophysical measurements are being supported by multilevel vertical hydraulic head profiles, groundwater discharge measurements, continuous aqueous electrical conductivity of the surface water and groundwater, and time-lapse groundwater temperature profiles along lined boreholes.",

            "abstract": "Observed retreat of Antarctica's marine-based glaciers and the presence of warm (~2°C) modified Circumpolar Deep Water on Antarctica's continental shelves imply ocean temperatures may influence Antarctic cryosphere stability. A paucity of information regarding Late Quaternary East Antarctic cryosphere-ocean interactions makes assessing the variability, timing, and style of deglacial retreat difficult. Marine sediments from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica contain hemipelagic siliceous mud and ooze units (SMO) alternating with glacial marine sediments. The record suggests Late Quaternary variability of local outlet glacier systems, including the Lambert Glacier/Amery Ice Shelf system that drains 15% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nWe present a refined radiocarbon chronology and beryllium-10 (10Be) record of Late Quaternary depositional history in Prydz Channel, seaward of the Amery Ice Shelf system, which provides insight into the timing and variability of this important outlet glacier system. We focus on three piston cores (NBP01-01, JPC 34, 35, 36; 750 m water depth) that contain alternating SMO and granulated units uninterrupted by glacial till; the record preserves a succession of glacial marine deposits that pre-date the Last Glacial Maximum. We utilize the ramped pyrolysis preparatory method to improve the bulk organic carbon 14C-based chronology for Prydz Channel. To determine if the SMO intervals reflect open water conditions or sub-ice shelf advection, we measured sedimentary 10Be concentrations. Because ice cover affects 10Be pathways through the water column, sedimentary concentrations should provide information on past depositional environments in Prydz Channel.\nIn Prydz Channel sediments, 10Be concentrations are generally higher in SMO units and lower in glacial units, suggesting Late Quaternary fluctuations in the Amery Ice Shelf. Improved chronologic constraints indicate that these fluctuations occurred on millennial timescales during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation (~35-10 ka). Timing and depositional history of SMO units suggest environmental forcing on ice shelf evolution. While the driver of Amery Ice Shelf retreat is uncertain, our study provides new insight into the calving history of the largest outlet glacier in East Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Global agricultural production is dominated by rainfed agriculture, and is therefore prone to disruption from climate extreme weathers. These uncertainties become more problematic when considering the projection of increased drought frequency suggested by several climate models for various world regions. Curiously, few regional analyses of drought impact of food production have been attempted. We collated and analyzed data from the last 25 years to disentangle the effects of drought (i.e. timing, intensity and duration) on agricultural production in different eco-regions and with varying crop types. Our preliminary results suggested greater yield reduction in annual (-21.5%) than perennial plants (-16%), in C4 (-21%) compared to C3 crops (-17%), and when drought occurred during generative (i.e. flowering until maturity; -16.5%) than vegetative stage (-15.5%). Although drought caused similar amounts of yield reduction in both tropical and subtropical regions (i.e. -17%), it carries a greater food security risk in the tropics due to inherently low productivity (i.e. less than half than in the subtropical regions). Consequently, cultivating drought-resistant C3 perennial plants (e.g. sweet potato and cassava) in the tropics could prove a viable adaptive strategy to mitigate the effects of climate variability. In addition, these crops have limited input requirements, are well adapted to nutrient-poor Oxisols and Ultisols of the tropics, and generally outyield cereal crops in the region. Our analysis is ongoing and needs to take into account agronomic traits (e.g. water requirement), as well as the energy and nutritional values (e.g. protein, minerals) of alternative crops. Our results could inform the selection and development of new cultivars for the drought-prone regions of the world.",

            "abstract": "In Japan, the siting process of geological repositories for vitrified high-level radioactive waste and low-level radioactive waste containing long-lived nuclides shall comprise step-wise site investigations and evaluations. The Detailed Investigation Areas will be selected focusing on the suitability for the host rock where the underground facility is constructed, after a series of surface-based investigations at Preliminary Investigation Areas. The suitability shall be judged by considering multi-disciplinary performances of the rock mass, such as thermal, hydrologic, mechanical and geochemical conditions and the volume of rock mass, based on the site models. However, the limited geoscientific information yields relatively large uncertainties of the site models, especially the hydrogeological models due to a wider variability of hydraulic properties. The uncertainties make it difficult to clarify the relationship among the site investigation, repository design (Design) and safety assessment (SA). In this study, groundwater travel time is identified as one of the important evaluation factors relevant for SA in terms of hydrology. In addition, the various options for evaluating the groundwater travel time are put together into a tree diagram. The highest level of the tree diagram is defined by the evaluation factor (groundwater travel time), and evaluation methods are systematically classified into multi-levels that comprise analytical methods/models in one dimension and three dimensions, parameters, datasets, data and investigation methods. Multiple options, such as alternative cases and/or models caused by uncertainties in data, analytical methods and models, are incorporated at each level of the tree diagrams. The feasibility of the tree diagram was examined by tracing both analytical options. Through this examination, the importance of interaction among the site investigation, SA and Design was also demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "Human interactions with groundwater systems often exhibit complex features that hinder the sustainable management of the resource. This leads to costly and persistent conflicts over groundwater at the catchment scale. One possible way to address these conflicts is by gaining a better understanding of how social and groundwater dynamics coevolve using agent-based models (ABM). Such models allow exploring ‘bottom-up’ solutions (i.e., self-organised governance systems), where the behaviour of individual agents (e.g., farmers) results in the emergence of mutual cooperation among groundwater users. There is significant empirical evidence indicating that this kind of ‘bottom-up’ approach may lead to more enduring and sustainable outcomes, compared to conventional ‘top-down’ strategies such as centralized control and water right schemes (Ostrom 1990). New modelling tools are needed to study these concepts systematically and efficiently.\nOur model uses a conceptual framework to study cooperation and the emergence of social norms as initially proposed by Axelrod (1986), which we adapted to groundwater management. We developed an ABM that integrates social mechanisms and the physics of subsurface flow. The model explicitly represents feedback between groundwater conditions and social dynamics, capturing the spatial structure of these interactions and the potential effects on cooperation levels in an agricultural setting. Using this model, we investigate a series of mechanisms that may trigger norms supporting cooperative strategies, which can be sustained and become stable over time. For example, farmers in a self-monitoring community can be more efficient at achieving the objective of sustainable groundwater use than government-imposed regulation. Our coupled model thus offers a platform for testing new schemes promoting cooperation and improved resource use, which can be used as a basis for policy design. Importantly, we hope to raise awareness of agent-based modelling as a new tool for studying complex human-groundwater systems.",

Yet these models are too often complicated for managers, the general public and for students to understand. Simpler modelling environments will help with finding solutions by engaging a broader segment of the population. Such environments will enable education at the earliest stages and collective action. I propose that simulation games can be an effective communication platform between scientists and ‘non-experts’ and that such games will shed light on problems of pollution and overuse of water resources. In the same way as pilots use flight simulators to become proficient at flying aircraft, simulation games—if underpinned by good science—can be used to educate the public, students and managers about how to best manage our water resources.

One way to constrain potential loss is to compare soils with and without permafrost. We compared three sets of soil profiles developed in late Pleistocene loess from various slope positions in western Iowa (no permafrost for >10ka), south-central Alaska (no permafrost for > 3550 y), and interior Alaska (current permafrost). In Iowa C where deep C was protected by loess burial, % soil C declined most precipitously with depth (down to < 0.6 %C at 1m). Alaska soils with and without permafrost were similar in %C at 1m depths (up to 2% C). However soils with permafrost had 2X to 4X more C than non-permafrost soils at 1.5 m and maintained high and highly variable (0.8 to 11% C) C contents below 150 cm. Data provide an additional line of evidence that carbon in deep permafrost is highly susceptible to loss upon thawing. Meanwhile modeling and forecasting C fate requires more insight into C protection and stabilization by burial.",

The NSF-GeoPRISMS Mini-lesson Project, funded by NSF-TUES, is designed to integrate the significant findings from the MARGINS program into open-source college-level curriculum. The Gulf of California (GOC) served as the focus site for the Rupturing Continental Lithosphere initiative, which addressed several scientific questions: What forces drive rift initiation, localization, propagation and evolution? How does deformation vary in time and space, and why? How does crust evolve, physically and chemically, as rifting proceeds to sea-floor spreading? What is the role of sedimentation and magmatism in continental extension?\nWe developed two weeks of curriculum designed for an upper-division structural geology, tectonics or geophysics course. The curriculum includes lectures, labs, and in-class activities that can be used as a whole or individually. The first set of materials introduces the RCL initiative to students and has them analyze the bathymetry and oblique-rifting geometry of the GOC in an exercise using GeoMapApp. The second set of materials has two goals: (1) introduce students to fundamental concepts of interpreting seismic reflection data via lectures and in-class interpretation of strata, basement, and faults from recent GOC seismic data, and (2) encourage students to discover the structural geometry and rift evolution, including the east-to-west progression of faulting and transition from detachment to high-angle faulting in the northern GOC, and changes in deformation style from north to south. In the third set of materials, students investigate isostatic affects of sediment fill in GOC oblique rift basins. This activity consists of a problem set, introduced in a lecture, where students integrate their findings from the previous bathymetry- and seismic-interpretation exercises.",

            "abstract": "Increased understanding of the dynamics of the real ocean depends crucially on global-scale routine observations of oceanic and surface atmospheric variables. A new milestone has been reached with the launch of two dedicated satellite missions to routinely measure the sea surface salinity (SSS) fields from space. In the present work, a thorough analysis of the first 2 years of Aquarius SSS data in the South Indian Ocean is performed together with the Argo and RAMA data. This analysis is focused into 3 questions: How accurately is Aquarius observing the fresh Indonesian Throughflow and the salty subtropical waters? Can Aquarius give a spatial context for interpreting the data measured by the RAMA mooring system, which are highly resolved in time, but very sparse in space? Can westward propagating seasonal signals be observed in the Aquarius SSS fields as recently described in model simulations? We find Aquarius observations to be highly correlated with those obtained from Argo and RAMA, with lowest RMS differences found in the salty subtropical waters. In the tropical region, Aquarius gives slightly fresher SSS than in situ data mainly due to rainfall effects, except in the eastern basin where the freshening seems to be related to sharp localized leakages of very fresh waters from the Indonesian seas that the Aquarius L3 product is not able to properly resolve. Aquarius data are shown to reproduce quite well the annual cycle obtained from RAMA and Argo gridded data sets. The annual cycle is characterized by SSS propagating features with different characteristics west and east of the Ninety East Ridge, with the observed patterns better interpreted as a superposition of planetary wave modes. The SSS features are strikingly different from altimetry-derived sea surface height waves. Our results suggest that SSS annual propagation might be reflecting coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics and surface-subsurface processes operating over the entire South Indian Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The 28th Feb. 1997 Golestan-Ardebil earthquake (Mw 6.1) struck an area around the southeast of Sabalan Volcano in NW Iran, where the regional shortening between Arabia and Eurasia mostly is accommodated by a complex system of right-lateral strike slip and thrust faulting. The region is surrounded by rigid South Caspian Basin (SCB) in the east, North Tabriz right-lateral strike-slip fault (NTF) in the west, thrust faulting in Caucasus in the north, and thrust faulting along Bozghoush fault in the south. Therefore, finding the causative fault plane of the event has a key role in understanding of the accommodation of the regional strain in the region. Based on CMT moment tensor solution, the causative fault plane could be either an E-W right lateral or a N-S left lateral strike slip fault, whereas the recognition of the causative fault plane is impossible due to the lack of a surface rupture and also large error in location of aftershocks. In this work, we significantly improved the location of the main shock and its large aftershocks by using a multiple-event relocation method (HDC). We also added more recent events recorded both by local and regional networks and critical nearby S-P phases from the accelerometer network of Iran. The relocated locations of the main shock and its larger immediate aftershocks is in a good agreement with a N-S trending fault plane which implies a left-lateral strike slip faulting for the Golestan event. The presence of a North trending left-lateral fault might be connected to the way the strain is accommodated within the block wedged among SCB, Caucasus and NTF.\nThe relocated aftershocks mostly lie north of the main shock and that implies an almost northward directivity of the rupture. The depth of main event is about 18 km and the depth of seismicity varies from 6 to 22 km. Furthermore, some events are aggregated around inward dipping to subvertical ring faults and other fractures associated with the caldera of Sabalan Volcano. Those seem to be smaller earthquakes triggered by the main shock.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this presentation is to introduce a set of key concepts that can guide the development of ecological governance systems and briefly describe a watershed ecological governance project in south-central Texas. Ecological governance is a form of governance embedding ecological principles and values in all levels of decision making and action, from the personal to the global. The model of ecological governance discussed here incorporates ideas and approaches that are already being put into practice in many watershed governance projects in the US and abroad; it is based on the premise that contemporary governance systems will continue to evolve in this direction, incorporating more and more of the features of ecological governance. The watershed governance project described here was devised to ensure that the long-term ecological integrity of a small urbanazing waterhed in south-central Texas is preserved and that the water quality standards are maintained for present and future generations. The ecological integrity of small spring-fed watersheds in Texas are under serious threat due to rapid urban development dependent on groundwater supplies, continued drilling of personal wells that are exempt from pumping regulation, and lack of adequate legal jurisdiction for managing development in rural and semi-rural areas. The watershed governance project was motivated by a firm belief of local stakeholders that watershed protection is an individual as well as a community responsibility, and the recognition that a balance between growth and protection is essential to maintain watershed integrity. It is concluded that whereas emergent systems of ecological governance struggle to succeed in an institutional context oriented towards the pursuit of self-interest and competition, their acceptance will happen more readily as ecological principles and values diffuses throughout modern society.",

From the active experiments, we highlight the transversely isotropic P-wave velocity field of the rock mass, used to efficiently locate the acoustic sources and validate the location procedure. From the passive experiments, we identify the stress-induced microseismic events with confidence by developing a restrictive but efficient multi-step filtering method. We deduce both their spatial distribution and processes from the location and focal mechanisms of the microseismic event sources. We observe an asymmetric geometry of the excavation damaged zone around the excavated gallery, without notable microseismic activity in the sandy facies sidewall. A burst of microseismic events locates in the shaly facies sidewall followed by two smaller bursts which occurred when the excavation procedure was stopped. The first one locates ahead of the excavation front and is associated with a dominant double-couple component, suggesting bedding plane reworking, that is, shear along bedding planes and associated wing-cracks. The second one locates inside the shaly sidewall of the gallery and is associated to a dominant compensated linear vector dipole, suggesting extensive cracking, that is, typical spalling damage in the vicinity of the stress concentration zone.

            "abstract": "Sarawak is located on the northern edge of Sundaland in NW Borneo. Five sedimentary basins are distinguished with ages from Triassic to Cenozoic. New light mineral, heavy mineral and U-Pb detrital zircon ages show differences in provenance reflecting the tectonic evolution of the region. The oldest clastic sediments are Triassic of the Sadong-Kuching Basin and were sourced by a Carnian to Norian volcanic arc and erosion of Cathaysian rocks containing zircons of Paleoproterozoic age. Sandstones of the Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous Bau-Pedawan Basin have distinctive zircon populations indicating a major change of tectonic setting, including initiation of subduction below present-day West Sarawak in the Late Jurassic. A wide range of inherited zircon ages indicates various Cathaysian fragments as major source areas and the arrival of the SW Borneo Block following subduction beneath the Schwaner Mountains in the early Late Cretaceous. After collision of the SW Borneo Block and the microcontinental fragments with Sundaland in the early Late Cretaceous, deep marine sedimentation (Pedawan Formation) ceased, and there was uplift forming the regional Pedawan–Kayan unconformity. Two episodes of extension were responsible for basin development on land from the latest Cretaceous onwards, probably in a strike-slip setting. The first episode formed the Kayan Basin in the Latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to Early Paleocene, and the second formed the Ketungau Basin and the Penrissen Sandstone in the Middle to Late Eocene. Zircons indicate nearby volcanic activity throughout the Early Cenozoic in NW Borneo. Inherited zircon ages indicate an alternation between Borneo and Tin Belt source rocks. A large deep marine basin, the Rajang Basin, formed north of the Lupar Line fault. Zircons from sediments of the Rajang Basin indicate they are of similar age and provenance as the contemporaneous terrestrial sediments to the south suggesting a narrow steep continental Sundaland margin at the position of the Lupar Line.",

            "abstract": "Eruptions at basaltic andesitic systems are often characterized by e ffusive behavior. However, an increasing number of examples around the World indicate that these magmas, with low degrees of diff erentiation and basic compositions, have the capacity to produce explosive eruptions; thus presenting a considerable hazard.\nVolcanoes in the Chaîne des Puys (France), more speci cally the Puy de la Vache volcano, are good examples of explosive activity at basaltic andesitic centers. A combination of factors can explain this behavior: high magma ascent rate, high content of dissolved gases and high crystal contents. The latter leads to an increase in magma viscosity. The rheological properties of the magma control the eruptive style; viscosity itself strongly depends on composition, temperature, crystal fraction and vesicularity. In particular, an increase in crystal content may drastically change the composition of the residual melt and adds rigid particles to the mixture, inducing a complex strain rate dependence.\nHere, we are interested in the rheology of basaltic andesitic magmas as a function of crystal content. To quantify the eff ect of crystals on the viscosity, we measured the stress-strain relationship of the remelted Puy de la Vache lava by concentric cylinder viscometry at super and subliquidus conditions. Concurrently, we performed a textural analysis to determine the crystal fraction at each temperature. We also measured viscosities close to the glass transition using a parallel plate viscometer. We then compared the measured viscosities with those obtained from calculations using existing models. With the experimentally obtained stress-strain rate relationship of the magma at diff erent temperatures and crystal fractions, our goal is to design a model where viscosity varies across the conduit depending on the shear stress and strain rate conditions. This will allow us to characterize the potential explosive behavior of basaltic to andesitic magmas.",

            "abstract": "Analyses of Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) have shown that the Earth’s mantle contains isotopically distinct components, but debate about the degree and cause of variability persists. The study of silicon (Si) isotopes in OIBs has the potential to elucidate mantle heterogeneities. Relatively large (~several per mil) Si isotopic fractionation occurs in low-temperature environments during precipitation from dissolved Si, where the precipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes [1], but only a limited range (~tenths of a per mil) of Si isotope fractionation has been observed due to high-temperature igneous processes [2]. Therefore, Si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of crustal material in OIB source regions in a manner similar to more conventional stable isotope systems, such as oxygen.\nHere we present the first comprehensive suite of high-precision Si isotopic data obtained by MC‑ICP‑MS for a diverse set of OIBs representing the EM‑1, EM‑2, and HIMU mantle components. In general, the Si isotopic compositions of OIBs analyzed here are agreement with previous estimates for Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE). However, small systematic variations are present; the HIMU end-member Mangaia and HIMU-type Cape Verde island São Nicolau are enriched in the light isotopes of Si (δ30Si = −0.37 ± 0.06‰ and δ30Si = −0.39 ± 0.04‰, respectively; errors are 2sd), with compositions intermediary between Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts and chondritic values. Additionally, Iceland samples from volcanic complexes in the Northern Rift Zone show similar Si isotope compositions (on average, δ30Si = −0.40 ± 0.06‰). In contrast, the δ30Si averages of the EM-1 end-member Pitcairn (−0.28 ± 0.07‰), the EM-2 end-member Samoa (−0.31 ± 0.07‰) and other OIB localities do not show any significant difference from previous estimates for the δ30Si value of BSE [3].\nThe Si isotopic variability in some HIMU-type and Icelandic OIBs most likely reflects the incorporation of recycled altered oceanic crust in the plume source. However, the sampling of a primitive reservoir enriched in the light isotopes of Si, as suggested by [4], cannot be ruled out as a potential source of Si isotope variations in OIBs.\n",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to have large impacts on peak flows. There are, however, large uncertainties in the simulation of peak flows by hydrological models. This study aims to improve the simulation of peak flows under climate change in Lanjiang catchment, East China by comparing two approaches: post-processing of peak flows and multi-objective calibration. Two hydrological models (SWAT and GR4J) are employed to simulate the daily flows and the peaks-over-threshold method is used to extract peak flows from the simulated daily flows. Three post-processing methods, namely the quantile mapping method and two generalized linear models, are set up to correct the biases in the simulated raw peak flows. Besides, a multi-objective calibration of the GR4J model by taking the peak flows into account in the calibration process is carried out. The regional climate model PRECIS with boundary forcing from two GCMs (HadCM3 and ECHAM5) under greenhouse gas emission scenario A1B is applied to produce the climate data for the baseline period and the future period 2011-2040. The results show that the post-processing methods, particularly quantile mapping method, can correct the biases in the raw peak flows effectively. The multi-objective calibration also resulted in a good simulation performance of peak flows. The final estimated peak flows in the future period show an obvious increase compared with those in the baseline period, indicating there are probably more frequent floods in Lanjiang catchment in the future.",

            "abstract": "Lake levels in basins in areas bordering northern Arabian Sea have been used to reconstruct regional paleohydrological patterns through lake-level statuses. For the early-middle Holocene, dramatic increases in regional rainfall have been proposed. These rainfall changes are commonly thought to be associated with an intensified Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and a large northward shift in the latitude of the boreal summer ITCZ over the Indian Ocean; this shift was proposed to reach latitudes as far north as the Levant. However, the ISM currently forces total summer drought not rains, in the Levant and neighboring deserts, including Arabia. The drought is due to large-scale air subsidence forced by the ISM and dries the region except in southernmost Arabia, where topography lifts air and produces orographic rain. This Arabian summer drought is assisted by increased upwelling that limits rainfall inland. How large the actual changes in paleohydrology were in the Arabian Peninsula? If not the ISM, what are the real causes of these changes? We summarize paleohydrologic information from Arabia and revisit the paleolake status of all lacustrine-like deposits and their basins in Arabia. From reinterpretation of these data and sedimentology and fauna, we conclude that these basins were occupied by shallow marsh environments, not lakes. Consequently, the paleohydrologic changes required to support restricted wetland versus lakes were much smaller. These conclusions are supported by the temporal and spatial distribution of other paleoenvironmental indicators such as pollen and speleothems. They indicate that (a) rainfall changes were very small in the heart of and northern Arabia, and (b) that these changes were only at the elevated edges of southwestern, southern, and southeastern Arabian Peninsula, where it rains at present, mainly due to orographic effects on precipitation in the presence of increased moisture supply. We propose that (a) latitudinal and slight inland impact expansion of the North African summer monsoon rains across the Red Sea, and (b) its uplifted air to southwestern Arabia highlands, rather than rains associated with intensification of ISM, increased rains in that region, producing the modest paleowetlands in downstream hyperarid basins.",

            "abstract": "Seismic moment tensor is one of the most important source parameters defining the earthquake dimension and style of the activated fault. Moment tensor catalogues are ordinarily used by geoscientists, however, few attempts have been done to assess possible impacts of moment magnitude uncertainties upon their own analysis. The 2012 May 20 Emilia mainshock is a representative event since it is defined in literature with a moment magnitude value (Mw) spanning between 5.63 and 6.12. An uncertainty of ~0.5 units in magnitude leads to a controversial knowledge of the real size of the event. The possible uncertainty associated to this estimate could be critical for the inference of other seismological parameters, suggesting caution for seismic hazard assessment, coulomb stress transfer determination and other analyses where self-consistency is important.\nIn this work, we focus on the variability of the moment tensor solution, highlighting the effect of four different velocity models, different types and ranges of filtering, and two different methodologies. Using a larger dataset, to better quantify the source parameter uncertainty, we also analyze the variability of the moment tensor solutions depending on the number, the epicentral distance and the azimuth of used stations. We endorse that the estimate of seismic moment from moment tensor solutions, as well as the estimate of the other kinematic source parameters, cannot be considered an absolute value and requires to come out with the related uncertainties and in a reproducible framework characterized by disclosed assumptions and explicit processing workflows.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering mantle flow patterns and their interplay with lithospheric motions remains a debated question. Because they are driven by density anomalies and dynamically deflect Earth's internal interfaces, such flows are expected to contribute to geoid and topography variations. By modifying the thermal structure of the lithosphere, they may also influence the subsidence of oceanic plates.\nOver the oceans, geoid undulations in a wide range of wavelengths, and regional variations of the subsidence, have been evidenced since the advent of satellite altimetry. The existence of a directional geoid fabric along the plate motions, in a range of scales up to 2000 km, has been confirmed over the Pacific ocean by a recent analysis of GRACE satellite gravity data (Hayn et al., 2012). Consistently, a shear velocity model of the upper mantle, SEMum2 (French et al., 2013), indicates the presence of low shear velocity channels extending horizontally in the upper mantle. Oriented along the absolute plate motion, they are found under all oceans.\nIn order to understand the nature of these channels, and characterize the flows at different scales below the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, we perform a joint analysis of seismic, geoid and bathymetry data. First, we isolate the geoid and bathymetry directional signal at different spatial scales using a gradients analysis. Then, we carry out sensitivity tests and compare the obtained signals to those based on seismic tomography results and different viscosity profiles. We discuss here our preliminary results.",

Electrons can promptly gain energy from ULF waves when they resonate with each other via a process named drift resonance, which is characterized in spacecraft observations by an energy dependence of phase differences between electron fluxes and electromagnetic oscillations. Such a dependence, recently observed by Van Allen Probes, has been presented as a most unambiguous identification of the drift-resonance electron acceleration (Claudepierre et al., 2013). In this paper, we revisit the same event to find that in the early stage of the ULF oscillations, the observed phase relationship appeared to be not fully consistent with the drift resonance theory. We further examine these apparent inconsistencies, to suggest that they arose from the fast growth of travelling Alfven waves before they were transitioned into the more typical standing waves. These observations, therefore, provide a rare opportunity to understand the generation, evolution, and particle-interaction of ULF oscillations in the Earth's magnetosphere.",

For permanganate (MnO4-) in particular, the chemistry of degradative oxidation is well established for cleaning up groundwater containing trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). However the long-term effectiveness of the application of this oxidant has been questioned due to the observed post remediation rebound of contaminant concentrations. To improve the efficiency of ISCO using MnO4-under specific site conditions, the technology of emplacing slow-releasing permanganate in an aquifer has been studied.\nWe have developed an injectable slow-release permanganate slurry/gel (ISRPG) by mixing KMnO4 with fumed silica in water. Ideally, the slurry/gel forms would release low concentration of MnO4- by diffusion to maintain a desired concentration level of the agent within the chemically active zone. We have investigated the properties and tested the application of this ISRPG in laboratory studies. Rheological study indicated ISRPG has high viscosity and shear thinning property. The viscosity of silica gel could be lowered by mechanical mixing thus making it easy for subsurface injection. Batch tests revealed that MnO4- was diffused from ISRPG and the gel did not disperse but maintained its initial shape. In column experiments we showed that permanganate release covered 6 times more effluent pore volumes when ISRPG was injected compared to MnO4- solution injection. We also observed TCE degradation by released MnO4-, and the remedial performance occurred over a much longer timeframe with ISRPG compared to MnO4- solution injection. In 2-D flow cell tests we demonstrated that water flows around the injected gel, carrying MnO4- diffused out from the gel and forming a downstream oxidant plume, while the gel was stationary. ISRPG slowly released low concentrations of permanganate to maintain a predetermined level of the agent within the chemically active zone.",

            "abstract": "The pathways of exchange of surface water and groundwater can have a significant influence on the delivery of nutrient-rich groundwater to streams. Many studies have revealed how the spatial variability of physical properties (sediment permeability, bedform structures, etc.) at the interface of groundwater and surface water can impact on flow pathways and residence times of hyporheic exchange flow. Here we explore the temporal variability of flow pathways at this interface. We focus on observations made on a study reach of the River Leith, UK but also provide evidence of dynamic exchanges at a number of other study sites. Under baseflow conditions, the study reach of the River Leith shows a predominance of upwelling of groundwater to the river, and in some sections of the reach a significant groundwater discharge zone in evident. However, from observations of piezometric heads made over a two year study period, repeated reversal of flow direction was observed during storm events. By deploying novel miniature electrode sensors in the river bed we were able to monitor the migration of surface water during these events. Penetration of river water to depths of 30cm was observed during monitored events, which support the reported reversal of hydraulic gradients. We, therefore, observed event-driven hyporheic exchange flow. The duration and frequency of such events may have significant impact on the biogeochemistry of shallow river bed sediments within this reach. Furthermore, temporal variability of exchange is not limited to such events: changes in regional groundwater flow pathways over longer time scales may have a significant impact on the location of localised upwelling; at much shorter timescales we see evidence of diurnal fluctuations in hydraulic heads due to evapotranspiration processes. We report on similar observations at companion study sites and discuss implications on the management of water quality in these groundwater fed systems.",

            "abstract": "The two main processes involved in forest ecosystems carbon balance are photosynthesis and respiration. Ecosystem respiration is determined by heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration, the former driven by microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), the latter by growth and maintenance of plant tissues. Thus it is extremely important to reliably quantify ecosystem respiration in order to estimate the global carbon budget of a forest ecosystem, namely the Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE). For the very same reason we have improved the 6.1 version of the 3D-CMCC-Forest Ecosystem Model (3D-CMCC-FEM) with both a multilayer soil Carbon dynamics routine and several modifications in phenology and littering. Bud burst phenology has been improved with a new “Nonstructural Carbon injection function” representing the quantity of Carbon destined to new leaves and fineroots growth; fall phenology has been improved with a novel physical driven logistic function to simulate leaf falling. Soil carbon dynamics throughout the Residues, Microbial and Humads pools follow a zero order kinetics equation, representing microbial decomposition activity. The sum of CO2 oxidized at each decomposition step form Heterotrophic respiration.\nThe present work focuses on the presentation of the 6.1 version of the 3D-CMCC-FEM and its validation against six FLUXNET sites representing a transect throughout the main European forest Ecosystems.

            "abstract": "Improper disposals of hazardous wastes in most industrial countries give rise to severe groundwater contamination problems that can lead to adverse health effects in humans. Therefore risk assessment methods play an important role in population protection by (1) quantifying the impact on human health of an aquifer contamination and (2) aiding the decision making process of to better manage our groundwater resources.\nMany reactive components such as chlorinated solvent or nitrate potentially experience attenuation processes under common geochemical conditions. Based on this, monitored natural attenuation has become nowadays an attractive remediation solution. However, in some cases, intermediate degradation products can constitute noxious chemical compounds before reaching a harmless chemical form. In these cases, the joint effect of advection-dispersion transport and the species-dependent kinetic reactions and toxicity will dictate the relative importance of the degradation byproducts to the total risk. This renders the interpretation of risk a non-trivial task.\nIn this presentation, we quantify, through a probabilistic framework, the human health risk posed by a chemical mixture in a heterogeneous aquifer. This work focuses on a Perchloroethylene contamination problem followed by the first-order production/biodegradation of its daughter species Trichloroethylene, Dichloroethylene and Vinyl Chlorine that is known to be highly toxic. Uncertainty on the hydraulic conductivity field is considered through a Monte Carlo scheme.\nA comparative description of human health risk metrics as a function of aquifer heterogeneity and contaminant injection mode is provided by means of a spatial characterization of the lower-order statistical moments and empirical probability density functions of both individual and total risks. Interestingly, we show that the human health risk of a chemical mixture is mainly controlled by a modified Damköhler number that express the joint effect of contaminant mean travel times, reaction kinetics and chemical toxicity. From this, connectivity is shown to produce a significant and non-trivial impact on risk measures. The impact of connectivity can be potentially beneficial or detrimental on the magnitude of human health risk depending on the modified Damköhler number.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that clumped isotope thermometry records the temperature of precipitation for carbonate minerals in surface and near-surface environments. However, the ability of a mineral to retain its clumped isotope signature at deeper, hotter burial conditions is still debated. Dolomite has been shown to be more robust to clumped isotope bond reordering than calcite. In this contribution we measure clumped isotopes in calcite veins from Southern Europe that have been buried to up to 7 km to test the robustness of calcite and dolomite to bond reordering.\nFirst, we analysed finely crystalline dolostone matrix samples collected in industry wells from Southwest France and buried to between 2 and 5.5 km, Results indicated a temperatures of ~40-60 °C, interpreted to represent formation in an early burial environment. By contrast, coarser dolomite crystals that are petrographically distinct from the fine-grained dolomite record higher temperatures and are interpreted to reflect a deeper, hotter phase of dolomite formation.\nPreliminary analysis of a calcite vein from a Cretaceous dolostone in Southern Europe buried to 6.3 km records a temperature of 41±3 °C; the calcite matrix around this records a similarly low temperature. This is well below the present-day well temperature of 130-140 °C.\nOur results indicate that both calcite and dolomite are not affected by bond reordering at the range of depths and temperatures investigated here. Furthermore, this suggests that clumped isotope thermometry can be applied to deeply-buried samples (i.e. >5km).",

            "abstract": "Carbonaceous chondrites of the CM and CI groups contain large amounts of water bound in minerals, attesting to early water-rock interactions on their parent bodies. In CM2 chondrites such as the Murray meteorite the alteration assemblages mostly consist of serpentines with variable chemical compositions. Even though chondritic serpentines formed from anoxic fluids, they contain significant amounts of ferric iron. In order to evaluate mass transfers and redox processes during alteration, we performed a study of a heavily altered calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion (CAI), at the nanometer scale (Transmission Electron Microscopy and Soft x-Ray Scanning Transmission Spectro-Microscopy, on ultra-thin sections prepared by Focused Ion Beam - FIB - milling). Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Fe L2,3-edges, and based on literature references and on measurements of crystallographically oriented FIB foils of cronstedtite (the mixed-valence Fe endmember of serpentine) we estimated over 50% Fe3+ in alteration assemblages. We measured higher ferric iron proportions in mixed Fe,Mg,Al-serpentine/hydroxide disordered phases than in well-crystallized Al,Mg-bearing cronstedtite. We suggest that aqueous Fe2+ was transported to the initially Fe-depleted CAI. There, local changes in pH conditions and / or mineral catalysis would have promoted the partial oxidation of Fe. Later input of Al- and Mg-rich solutions might then have destabilized the initial serpentine, yielding assemblages un-equilibrated from the structural, chemical and redox point of views, similar to the polysomatic assemblages observed in terrestrial hydrothermal systems. Here, we illustrate the usefulness of such a combined study for better understanding the processes of hydration on the parent body of carbonaceous chondrites. Interestingly, as the reactions proposed for the oxidation of Fe generate hydrogen, reduction reactions - involving carbon species, for instance - are expected to follow the ones described here. Alternatively, given the high rate of diffusion of hydrogen some degree of H2 escape may be expected too, which would have induced increasingly oxidizing conditions during aqueous alteration.",

            "abstract": "Evaporation from the soil surface represents a water flow and transport process in a porous medium that is coupled with free air flow and with heat fluxes in the system. We give an overview of different model concepts that are used to describe this process. These range from non-isothermal two-phase flow two-component transport in the porous medium that is coupled with one-phase flow two-component transport in the free air to isothermal water flow in the porous with upper boundary conditions defined by a potential evaporation flux when available energy and transfer to the free air flow are limiting or by a critical threshold water pressure when soil water availability is limiting. The latter approach corresponds with the classical Richards equation with mixed boundary conditions. We formulated the different equations and identified assumptions behind simplified forms. Conditions for which lateral and up and downward air flow in the porous medium and vapor diffusion in the pore space play an important role were identified using simulations for a set of scenarios. When comparing cumulative evaporation fluxes from initially wet soil profiles, only small differences between the different models were found. The effect of vapor flow in the porous medium on cumulative evaporation could be evaluated using the desorptivity, Sevap, which represents a weighted average of liquid and vapor diffusivity over the range of soil water contents between the soil surface water content and the initial soil water content. Vapor flow influences the shape of the moisture front close to the soil surface. Simulated evaporation fluxes under dynamic forcing, e.g. due to diurnal variations in net radiation, differed considerably between the models. Experimental methods that allow monitoring of diurnal evaporation fluxes are therefore essential for model discrimination and parameterization.",

Here we consider the E Mediterranean region of plate interaction. We use DEFNODE software to develop block models and estimate slip rates on major faults and strain of some blocks. The wrms of residual velocities from our new model is 1.3 mm/yr. We identify small E-W extension within the newly defined Anatolian block confined to a 100-200 km wide zone south of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) reaching 2-3 mm/yr with rates increasing towards the west. Possible causes we consider include, un-modeled postseismic effects of the 1999 Izmit/Duzce earthquake sequence, continuing post-seismic effects of the 20th Century sequence of M>7 earthquakes, and/or toroidal sub-lithospheric flow towards the subducting Hellenic slab. The overall strain rate of the Marmara Sea block is dominantly N-S extension, and the Van block, N-S compression. Present slip rates along the NAF increase from E to W, 22-24 mm/yr along the E to E-central segment and 27-28 mm/yr along the W segment. We quantify extension in the G. of Corinth, central Greece, and G. of Evia; the W, central and E sections of the Hellenic Trench are shortening with extension in the back-arc. The W Hellenic Trench and W Peloponnese have right-lateral strike-slip and the E Hellenic Trench, left-lateral ss. N-S extension (2-4 mm/yr) in N Greece and the N Aegean Sea extends at least to 42°N. Arabia-Sinai left-lateral motion across the Dead Sea Fault is ~5 mm/yr along the S segment; significant residual velocities along the N and S segments indicate lower slip rates in the N and require fault segmentation to account for slip rate variations along strike.

Magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic constraints provide a high-resolution temporal framework for interpretation of this record.\nPaleomagnetic analyses of archive half core samples provide a continuous record of the geomagnetic field inclination down to 847 mbsf that allows construction of a detailed site magnetostratigraphy that closely matches the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (Gradstein et al., 2012). A total of 87 geomagnetic reversals have been recognized in the studied succession, extending back to ~36 Ma.\nDespite sporadic microfossil occurrences in parts, calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifera and radiolarians each contribute to the age model for the entire Site. All nannofossil marker species for Oligocene to Eocene Zones NP25 to NP19/20 are recognised. Beneath paleomagnetic control (847–1449 mbsf), foraminifera and radiolarians provide the only age control.\nThe most salient features of the age model are that: (i) average linear sedimentation rates during the Plio-Pleistocene range from 1.4 to 2.2 cm/ka; (ii) there was a reduction in sedimentation rates to 0.25 – 0.5 cm/ka throughout the Miocene; and (iii) sedimentation rates sharply increase again in the Oligocene to Late Eocene to a maximum of ~20 cm/ka.

For many day-to-day applications, the improved accuracy of fully-numerical simulations may not justify their computational costs; for other applications -- such as sampling-based approaches to solving inverse problems -- the efficiency of normal mode methods remains essential. Furthermore, observations of free oscillations provide important constraints on long wavelength Earth structure and dynamics.\nAt present, it is difficult to compute normal modes at frequencies higher than around 100 mHz, due to limitations in software available for these calculations. In order to remove this constraint (among others), and to provide the community with up-to-date software to compute normal mode synthetics in 1D and 3D models, we announce the development of the Free Oscillation Toolkit (FrOsT). In particular, we present new codes for calculating eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions in arbitrary 1D earth models, and for generating synthetic seismograms using mode summation. We also outline planned software to compute exact synthetic seismograms in 3D models, using mode coupling theory. All codes will be released on an open-source basis in due course.\nOur eigenfunction calculations rely on improved radial integration and mode-counting techniques, enabling stable calculations at high frequencies. For mode summation, we adopt the framework of generalised spherical harmonics, with a new algorithm for their efficient calculation. This formalism enables straightforward calculation of strain and rotation fields, in addition to displacement, and the use of higher-order moment tensors. Source parameter sensitivity kernels may also be readily obtained.",

Based on experimental data of a carbonate reservoir in China, we simply considered the low porosity samples equivalent to the matrix (micro-pore system) of the high porosity samples. For modeling the bimodal porous media, we considered that the matrix is homogeneous and interconnected. The connectivity and the pore size distribution of macro-pore system are varied randomly. Both pore systems are supposed to act electrically in parallel, connected at the nodes, where the fluid exchange takes place, an approach previously used by Bauer et al. (2012). Then, the effect of the properties of matrix, the pore size distribution and connectivity of macro-pore system on petrophysical properties of carbonates can be investigated. We simulated electrical current through networks in three-dimensional simple cubic (SC) and body-center cubic (BCC) with different coordination numbers and different pipe radius distributions of macro-pore system. Based on the simulation results, we found that the formation factor obeys a “universal” scaling relationship (i.e. independent of lattice type), 1/F∝eγz, where γ is a function of the normalized standard deviation of the pore radius distribution of macro-pore system and z is the coordination number of macro-pore system. This relationship is different from the classic “universal power law” in percolation theory. A formation factor model was inferred on the basis of the scaling relationship mentioned above and several scale-invariant quantities (such as hydraulic radius rH and throat length l of macro-pore). Several methods were developed to estimate corresponding parameters of the new model with conventional core analyses. It was satisfactorily tested against experimental data, including some published experimental data. Furthermore, the relationship between water saturation and resistivity in dual-pore carbonates was discussed based on the new model.",

Six cases of engine failures from icing were reported in 2013 at high altitudes for 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner planes at tropical latitudes (journalofcosmology.com volume 23). Lack of horizontal Coriolis forces accounts for the extreme intermittency of equatorial turbulence and turbulent mixing, Baker and Gibson (1987). Intermittency factors inferred from the available microstructure data sets were much larger than those at higher latitudes, reflecting the wide range of scales of the turbulence cascade from small scales to large in the horizontal direction. Lognormal statistical analysis implies mean values of dissipation rates are likely to be 30,000 times larger than mode values at the equator, compared to only 2000 times larger at midlatitudes.

            "abstract": "Plan-view curvature of geological structures and range-front topography has long been a recognized and debated feature of both ancient and active fold-thrust belts. As part of the largest active mountain range on Earth, much of the body of work surrounding this topic has focused on the Tibetan Plateau. A lack of published data, extremely limited geodetic coverage and difficulty of access mean there have been relatively few studies of the western part of the India-Asia collision zone, where the Himalaya curve to the southwest into the lobate fold-thrust belts of Pakistan. The widest of these, the Sulaiman Range, forms a strongly curved lobe with ~300km across-strike width.\nWe present observations and models of the Sulaiman Range of western Pakistan that shed new light on the evolution and deformation of fold-thrust belts. Earthquake source inversions show that the seismic deformation in the range is concentrated in the thick pile of sediments overlying the underthrusting lithosphere of the Indian subcontinent. The slip vectors of the earthquakes vary in strike around the margin of the range, in tandem with the shape of the topography, suggesting that gravitational driving forces arising from the topography play an important role in governing the deformation of the region. Numerical models suggest that the active deformation, and extreme plan-view curvature of the range, are governed by the presence of weak sediments in a pre-existing basin on the underthrusting Indian plate. These sediments affect the stress-state in the over-riding mountain range and allow for the rapid propagation of the nose of the range and the development of extreme curvature and laterally-varying surface gradients.",

            "abstract": "Observations performed in the solar wind by different satellites show that electron beams accelerated in the low corona during solar flares can propagate up to distances around 1 AU, that Langmuir waves' packets can be clumped into spikes with peak amplitudes three orders of magnitude above the mean and that the average level of density fluctuations in the solar wind plasmas can reach several percents. A Hamiltonian model is built describing the properties of Langmuir waves propagating in a plasma with random density fluctuations by the Zakharov's equations and the beam by means of particles moving self-consistently in the fields of the waves. Numerical simulations, performed using parameters relevant to solar type III conditions at 1 AU, show that when the average level of density fluctuations is sufficiently low, the beam relaxation and the wave excitation processes are similar to those in a homogeneous plasma and can be described by the quasilinear equations of the weak turbulence theory. On the contrary, when the average level of density fluctuations overcomes some threshold depending on the ratio of the thermal velocity to the beam velocity, the plasma inhomogeneities crucially influence on the characteristics of the Langmuir turbulence and the beam-plasma interaction. In this case, fluxes of accelerated particles are observed, whose density and kinetic energy can be calculated as a function of the beam and plasma characteristics. Langmuir waveforms are presented in the form they would appear if recorded by a satellite moving in the solar wind. Comparison with recent measurements by the STEREO and WIND satellites shows that their characteristic features are very similar to the observations. Moreover, wave-wave coupling and three wave decay processes are studied as a function of the average level of plasma density fluctuations.\n",

Although the composition of the Earth's lower mantle is dominated by the (Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)O3 perovskite, the mechanical properties of this phase, its microstructure, and the relative importance of the mechanisms cited above for its plastic deformation, are still a matter of debate. Given the thermodynamic conditions, both dislocation glide and climb are expected to contribute significantly to the plastic flow, however the activation energies and rates of these mechanisms are still to be determined.\nIn this study we utilize numerical simulations at the atomic scale in MgSiO3 perovskite to investigate the climb of dislocations, at pressure relevant to Earth's lower mantle. The interaction of vacancies with dislocations, as elementary mechanism for dislocation climb, is explicitly computed. It is shown to be dominated by electrostatic effects due to the ionic character of this material, and allow to give scenarios for climb mechanisms. These results give insight into the importance of dislocation creep in the rheology of the mantle.\nThis work was supported by funding from the European Research Council under the Seventh Framework Program (FP7), ERC grant N.290424 – RheoMan.",

            "abstract": "Although atmospheric rivers (ARs) typically weaken following landfall, those that penetrate inland can contribute to heavy precipitation and high-impact weather within the interior of western North America. In this paper, we examine the evolution of ARs over western North America using trajectories released at 950 and 700 hPa within cool-season ARs along the Pacific coast. These trajectories are classified as coastal decaying, inland penetrating, or interior penetrating based on whether they remain within an AR upon reaching selected transects over western North America. Interior-penetrating AR trajectories most frequently make landfall along the Oregon coast, but the greatest fraction of landfalling AR trajectories that eventually penetrate into the interior is found along the Baja Peninsula. In contrast, interior-penetrating trajectories rarely traverse the southern “high” Sierra. At landfall, interior-penetrating trajectories are associated with a more amplified flow pattern, more southwesterly (vs. westerly) flow along the Pacific coast, and larger water vapor transport (qu). The larger initial qu of interior-penetrating trajectories is due primarily to larger initial water vapor (q) and wind speed (u) for those initiated at 950 and 700 hPa, respectively.\nInland- and interior-penetrating AR trajectories maintain large qu over the interior due partially to increases in u that offset decreases in q, particularly in the vicinity of topographical barriers. Therefore, synoptic conditions and trajectory pathways favoring larger initial qu at the coast, limited water vapor depletion by orographic precipitation, and increases in u over the interior are keys to differentiating interior-penetrating from coastal-decaying AR trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Local anthropogenic emissions are limited in Nevada (USA); however, data collected at Great Basin National Park (GBNP), which is located in rural eastern Nevada, indicate that ozone (O3) routinely exceeds the threshold proposed for a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Here, we focused on data collected between July 2011 and June 2013. For this period, the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 at GBNP exceeded the current NAAQS threshold (75 ppb) 7 times. Our analyses indicate that a combination of sources including emissions from regional wildfires and urban areas of southern California as well as stratospheric intrusions and long-range transport of Asian pollution contributed to elevated O3 observed at GBNP. Although MDA8 O3 measured at GBNP was well correlated with that measured at 5 other rural Nevada sites during this period, MDA8 O3 was 3.1 to 12.6 ppb greater at GBNP than at these other rural sites which emphasizes the need for spatially detailed measurements particularly in areas of complex terrain. The maximum MDA8 O3 at these 6 rural NV sites ranged from 68 to 80 ppb. GBNP was the only rural site to exceed the current NAAQS threshold during the period considered; however, when lower thresholds were considered the spatial and temporal extent of exceedances in rural Nevada increased indicating that interstate and international cooperation will be necessary to reduce ambient O3 concentrations in rural Nevada. MDA8 O3 at rural Nevada sites were significantly correlated with measurements at urban Nevada (r = 0.64 to 0.82; p < 0.05) and rural California (r = 0.61 to 0.83; p = 0.00) sites suggesting that common mechanisms influence O3 observed throughout the region.",

Hillslopes evolve over time by gravity-driven processes, either directly, or through the mediator of flowing water. The distribution of gravity-induced surface stresses modulates this evolution, together with substrate properties, and in interaction with external forcing. If the stress vector at the surface of the slope has a surface-normal component, the detachment of material may be eased or made more difficult. Here, we propose that hillslopes evolve to obtain a stress-optimized form wherein at the surface, the vectors of stresses are everywhere parallel to the surface, and total strain is equal along every horizontal and vertical section. These conditions yield an optimal hillslope shape. There are two solutions for this shape, which are self-similar, such that the scale is dependent on a single length parameter, the base width of the structure. We present examples of optimal hillslopes, and discuss the general implications of this paradigm.",

            "abstract": "Symbioses between animals and chemoautotrophic bacteria dominate many hydrothermal vents. In these associations, symbiotic bacteria harness energy and “fix” carbon from the oxidation of reduced chemicals such as sulfide, methane, and hydrogen that are found in venting fluids. At vents along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) in the South Pacific, snails and mussels with chemoautotrophic symbionts have been shown to harness energy via the oxidation of sulfide. However, partially oxidized sulfur species such as thiosulfate and polysulfides have also been detected in abundance in their habitats. No studies to date have established whether thiosulfate or other partially oxidized sulfur compounds are used by these symbiotic associations, nor have studies constrained the potential role that symbioses might play in sulfur biogeochemical cycles at diffuse vent flows.\nTo address these questions, we used high-pressure, flow through incubations to study three symbiotic molluscs from the ELSC - the snails Alviniconcha and Ifremeria nautilei and the mussel Bathymodiolus brevior – at conditions mimicking those in situ. Via the use of isotopically labeled inorganic carbon, shipboard mass spectrometry and voltammetric microelectrodes, we quantified the production and consumption of different sulfur compounds by each of these symbioses. We established that the uptake and oxidation of either sulfide or thiosulfate could -to varying degrees- support carbon fixation in all three species. Notably, we also observed that some symbioses excreted thiosulfate and polysulfides under sulfidic conditions, suggesting that these symbioses are a source of partially oxidized sulfur species in the environment. We further observed spatial disparity in the carbon fixation rates among the individuals in our incubations that have implications for the variability of productivity in situ.Collectively, these data reveal that thiosulfate can support net autotrophy, and may be an ecologically important energy source for vent symbioses. Furthermore, symbioses-mediated sulfur transformations may influence the ecology of the free-living community by governing the production and consumption of reduced sulfur species in this habitat.",

            "abstract": "With amplified urbanization and industrialization during the last few decades, now more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. With surface particle matter (PM) concentration five or ten times higher than World Health Organization guidelines in some cities, it is very critical to accurately monitor PM air quality for global cities on a daily basis. The new version (C6) of MODIS Dark Target Land Aerosol Algorithm (MDT) provides near-daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals at 10km2 and 3km2 spatial resolutions, which can be used to estimate surface PM. However, initial validation efforts during DISCOVER-AQ field campaign over Baltimore-DC area showed that MDT overestimates AOD over urban areas, primarily because the bright and complex urban surface does not meet MDT assumptions. Surface characterization can be challenging and small error (~0.01) can produce large errors in retrieved AOD (~0.1), which can further lead to errors of around 5 μgm-3in surface PM2.5 air quality in highly urban areas. Here, we combined the urban percentage information from the MODIS Land Product (MCD12Q1) with MODIS land surface spectral reflectance product (MOD09A1) to derive a new urban surface reflectance relationship to be used within the MDT algorithm framework. We applied the new surface characterization to the MDT algorithm, and compared the retrieved AOD with AOD observed the ground-based AERONET network. AOD retrievals both in 10km and 3km spatial resolution show significant improvement over urban areas over the U.S. The bias in AOD reduced to -0.01 from 0.07, percentage of retrievals within uncertainty window increased to 85% from 62%. The improvement in AOD retrieval in other parts of the world is also observed but more analysis and research is required to apply these surface corrections globally. We will also present analysis on the impact of particulate matter air quality estimation over US while utilizing new retrievals as compared to existing retrievals over the urban areas.",

            "abstract": "There is a general need to understand floods in very flat sedimentary regions, particularly in the context of current climate and land use changes. While most landscapes respond to extreme rainfall inputs by increasing their liquid water outputs, very flat and poorly drained ones have little capacity to do this and their most common responses include (i) increased water storage leading to rising water tables and floods, (ii) increased evaporative water losses and, only at very high levels of storage, (iii) increased liquid water losses. We explored the relative importance of these pathways in the extensive plains of the Argentine Pampas, where two significant flood episodes took place in 2000-2003 and 2012-2013. We combined a new remote sensing estimate of 8-day surface water cover (SWC, based on MODIS albedo product), monthly terrestrial water stock (TWS, based on GRACE gravity recovery data), daily precipitation (PP, based on TRMM data), evapotranspiration (ET, based on MODIS NDVI and surface temperature data). Focusing on two of the most flood-prone areas of the Argentine Pampas (60 000 km² each) we found that in 2000-2003, SWC reached 18 and 15% in each region, while the accumulated precipitation anomalies respectively approached 500 and 800 millimeters since the beginning of the flood cycle. In 2012-2013, SWC peaked at 8 and 7% after respective precipitation excesses of 420 and 250 mm. There was a direct, somewhat linear coupling between SWC and TWS in the western region during both flood events, while significant hysteresis features in the eastern region hint at a decoupling between the terrestrial water reservoir and its surface component. The relationships between yearly SWC, TWS, PP and ET point at a surface-water-balance-driven water cycle in the east, with below-ground water storage exerting a secondary and delayed control on the somewhat rapid flood dynamics. On the contrary, a groundwater-connected water cycle is suggested in the west, where groundwater would buffer water excesses and, when water tables rise, triggers longer-sustained flood events (path (i) defined above). These two hydrological pictures are discussed, notably taking into account the reduction of TWS by nearly 100 mm between the two flood events.",

Such an intriguing difference is discussed in terms of paleo-sedimentary processes induced by the interaction between large scale marine current turbulence and seafloor morphology around a cape (Martorelli et al., 2010). However Martorelli’s et al. model for contourite location - which allows only an upstream contourite location for this kind of capes – fails in trying to explain such a difference. We thus focus on the local effect of a topographic depression, viz. a landslide scar off Cape Suvero, on flows contouring a cape. By applying the classical conservation of marine water potential vorticity we find a steady cyclonic circulation over the scar, that generates a \"geostrophic cascade\" that affects contourite deposition and stability. All this intuitively reminds the current dynamics around the Galileo’s Red Spot in Jupiter’s atmosphere. We thus show that the application of the potential vorticity conservation can provide a novel theoretical tool for investigating sedimentary structures and their evolution.",

A knowledge broker is an individual who connects scientific experts and relevant stakeholders with meaningful and useable information. Recognizing that information must flow in multiple directions, the knowledge broker must quickly and effectively translate needs and questions using established relationships. It is these relationships, as well as the synthesis of scientific knowledge into useable information, on which the success of the knowledge broker lies. Using lessons learned, as well as communication science theory related to knowledge brokering, this presentation highlights training opportunities for knowledge brokers who are primarily educated in science and engineering fields, yet seek to engage with societally relevant stakeholders. We present case study examples of knowledge brokering within two large multi-disciplinary research centers. These centers provide unique experiences for researchers to build relationships with stakeholders, so that the scientific experts not only create novel research within their specific discipline, but also inform policy decision makers, community members and regulatory officials.",

            "abstract": "Few examples of in situ fast-spread lower ocean crust exist for sampling. Here we present detailed textural analyses of two sample sets that formed at the East Pacific Rise, collected from tectonic windows at Pito (PD) and Hess (HD) deeps. PD samples (collected by ROV) span the upper ~900 m of lower crust. HD samples (collected by seafloor drilling during IODP Exp. 345) come from >1500 m below the sheeted dike gabbro transition (mbsd).\nPD gabbroic rock textures are consistent with a gabbro glacier flow model generating the uppermost plutonic crust. Shallow samples (41-72 mbsd) likely formed at the distal edge of the magma lens, analogous to similar rocks from Oman. These gabbros are relatively evolved (cpx Mg#75-77, An53-61 and 1-4% Fe-Ti oxides), and have elongate plagioclase grains (aspect ratios up to 1:2:10) exhibiting a strong shape preferred orientation (SPO) with <40% of grains showing dislocation creep textures. Deeper samples (177-876 mbsd) likely began crystallizing in the magma lens then subsided and ‘flowed’ through the underlying mush zone. These gabbros are more primitive below 386 mbsd (Fo83-88, cpx Mg# 85-89 and An70-82), and plagioclase grains have more equilibrated morphologies (aspect ratios < 1:2:6) that define ~vertical SPOs which increase in strength with depth. Plagioclase exhibits magmatic crystal-lattice preferred orientations (CPOs) which are also vertical. Significantly, the proportion of grains showing dislocation creep textures increases with depth, and plagioclase grain size distributions show a smaller range of sizes at depth; observations that perhaps reflect the effect of increasing strain with depth.\nIODP Hole U1415I at HD recovered gabbros and troctolitic gabbros from the mid lower crust that show distinctive cm-dm scale modal layering. Strong plagioclase SPOs parallel layering and magmatic CPOs vary dramatically in strength over just 4.5 m of core. Plagioclase grains are relatively equant (aspect ratios < 1:2:4), wrap around large cpx oikocrysts, and exhibit fewer dislocation creep textures than the PD gabbros. These observations perhaps suggest primary crystal accumulation rather than bulk strain/flow. The similar mineralogy and textures of these samples to those from the Rum layered intrusion suggest HD U1415I gabbros may have formed by mid-crust sill injection.",

            "abstract": "Slab roll-back and trench retreat are important factors for basin subsidence, magma generation and volcanism in arc-trench systems. From the sedimentary and tectonic record of the Central American island-arc it is evident that repeated slab roll-back and trench retreats occurred since the Late Cretaceous. These trench retreats were most probably related to the subduction of oceanic plateaus and seamounts. Evidence for trench retreats is given by pulses of uplift in the outer-arc area, followed by subsidence in both the fore-arc and back-arc basins. The first slab roll-back probably occurred during the Early Paleocene indicated by the collapse of carbonate platforms, and the re-deposition of large carbonate blocks into deep-water turbidites. At this time the island-arc was transformed from an incipient non-extensional stage into an extensional stage. A new pulse of uplift or decreased subsidence, respectively during the Late Eocene is attributed to subduction of rough crust, a subsequent slab detachment and the establishment of a new subduction zone further westward. Strong uplift especially affected the outer arc of the North Costa Rican arc segment. In the Sandino Fore-arc basin very coarse-grained deep-water channel-levee complexes were deposited. These deposits contain large well-rounded andesitic boulders and are rich in reworked shallow-water carbonates pointing to uplift of the inner fore-arc. Evidence for the subsequent trench retreat is given by an increased subsidence during the early Oligocene in the Sandino Fore-arc Basin and the collapse of the Barra Honda platform in North Costa Rica. Another trench retreat might have occurred in Miocene times. A phase of higher subsidence from 18 to 13 Ma is documented in the geohistory curve of the North Limon Back-arc Basin. After a short pulse of uplift the subsidence increased to approx. 300 m/myr.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of tree-ring widths are the most widely-distributed and best replicated source of surrogate environmental information on the planet, and are one of the main archives used to estimate changes in regional and global climate during the past several centuries or millennia. Because the Northern Hemisphere ring-width network is now so large, it is more crucial than ever to ensure our understanding of tree-environment relations is not influenced by decisions to include or exclude certain records. It may be the case that a particular set of ring-width records are, for whatever reason, more tightly coupled to a particular climate factor than other records from the same region or species and, as a result, may be superior estimators of that factor’s past behavior. At the same time, it is known that selecting a small number of predictors from a large pool of potential candidates increases the likelihood of a Type I error. That effect may be particularly relevant to dendroclimatology because the total number of available ring-width records is often much larger than the number of records used to produce reconstructions of large-scale climate features. As an initial step, it would be helpful if paleoclimate reconstructions derived from tree rings described more explicitly the criteria used to select ring-width records as potential predictors and specified those records excluded by that screening. By comparing ring-width chronologies and their relations with climate against the standard set by thousands of records across the hemisphere, we should be better able to distinguish climate signals from proxy noise and produce more accurate reconstructions of climate during the late Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Deep uncertainty refers to situations in which decision makers or stakeholders do not know, or cannot fully agree upon, the full suite of risk factors within a planning problem. This phenomenon is especially important when considering scenarios of future environmental change, since there exist multiple trajectories of environmental forcings (e.g., streamflow timing and magnitude) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., population growth). This presentation first briefly reviews robust optimization and scenario approaches that have been proposed to plan for systems under deep uncertainty. One recently introduced framework is Many Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). MORDM combines two techniques: evolutionary algorithm search is used to generate planning alternatives, and robust decision making methods are used to sample performance over a large range of plausible factors and, subsequently, choose a robust solution. Within MORDM, Pareto approximate tradeoff sets of solutions are used to balance objectives and examine alternatives.\nHowever, MORDM does not currently incorporate the deeply uncertain scenario information into the search process itself. In this presentation, we suggest several avenues for doing so, that are focused on modifying the suite of uncertain data that is selected within the search process. Visualizations that compare tradeoff sets across different sets of assumptions can be used to guide decision makers’ learning and, ultimately, their selection of several candidate solutions for further planning. For example, the baseline assumptions about probability distributions can be compared to optimization results under severe events to determine adaptive management strategies. A case study of water planning in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas is used to demonstrate the approach. Our LRGV results compare baseline optimization with new solution sets that examine optimal management strategies under scenarios characterized by lower than average streamflow and higher evaporation that mimic possible scenarios of water management under climate change. By examining how planning strategies change under the new optimization runs, we show the impact of deep uncertainty assumptions on the best strategies for mitigating environmental change in the LRGV problem.",

            "abstract": "Despite numerous experimental and numerical studies investigating transport over ripples and dunes in rivers, the spatiotemporal details of the pattern of transport over bedforms remain largely unknown. Here we report turbulence-resolving, simultaneous measurements of bedload motion and near-bed fluid velocity downstream of a backward facing step in a laboratory flume. Details are compared to a coupled large eddy simulation and distinct element simulation (LES-DEM) of the same geometry.\nTwo synchronized high-speed video cameras simultaneously observed bed load motion and the motion of neutrally buoyant particles in a laser light sheet 6 mm above the bed at 250 frames/s downstream of a 3.8 cm backward-facing step. Particle imaging velocimetry algorithms were applied to the laser sheet images to obtain two-dimensional field of two-dimensional vectors while manual particle tracking techniques were applied to the video images of the bed. As expected, there is a strong positive correlation between sediment flux and near-bed fluid velocity. Sediment flux was determined by manually tracking grains that passed over a 6 cm long line in the middle of the field of view on the bedload images. Sediment flux increased monotonically downstream of flow reattachment. Localized, intermittent, high-magnitude transport events were more apparent near flow reattachment than further downstream. Often, these high-magnitude events were seen to have significant cross-stream particle velocities. These events are consistent with permeable “splat events” visualized in the LES-DEM numerical simulations, wherein a volume of fluid moves toward and impinges on the bed. Fluid impingement and penetration of the bed results in outward flow and sediment motion from the center of the splat. Work is ongoing to quantify spatial and temporal autocorrelations and covariances of the fluid velocity and sediment motions.",

            "abstract": "Regional balance of the atmospheric energy budget provides a stringent constraint to evaluate datasets of global energy budgets. Previous studies indicated that satellite-based and reanalysis estimates describe different heating rates in the atmosphere. Compared to the satellite-based heating rates, reanalyses (European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast Interim, ERA-Interim, and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA) have larger heating in the tropical convective regimes and smaller cooling in the subtropical subsidence regimes. Many of these discrepancies originate in cloudy regions where different estimation methods give different energy budgets. In this study, we investigate how different components of the surface energy budget depend on cloud properties in the atmosphere. We will also examine the dependence of discrepancies between reanalysis and the satellite-based surface energy budgets on cloud properties. Different satellite-based estimates, including Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based surface shortwave and longwave heat fluxes, NASA Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment surface energy budget (SRB) shortwave and longwave radiative heat fluxes, Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Flux (GSSTF)’s sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the objectively-analyzed air-sea fluxes (OAFlux), are collocated with cloud property measurements of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud top pressure (CTP) are used to identify cloud types. Different components of surface energy budgets from the satellite-based estimates and the discrepancies from their reanalysis counterparts will be presented as functions of COD and CTP for selected regions that represent tropical convective and subtropical subsidence regimes.",

            "abstract": "Detection and attribution of human influence on sea level rise are important topics that have not yet been explored in depth. From the perspective of assessing the contribution of human activities to climate changes, the sea level drivers can be partitioned in anthropogenic and natural forcing. In this study we try to answer the following two questions: (1) How large a sea level trend could be expected as result of natural internal variability? (2) Whether the sea level changes observed over the past century were natural in origin. We suppose that natural behavior of sea level consists of increases and decreases occurring with frequencies following a power law distribution and the monthly sea level records are power law long-term correlated time series. Then we search for the presence of unnatural external sea level trend by applying statistics of Lennartz and Bunde [2009]. We estimate the minimum anthropogenic sea level trend as a lower bound of statistically significant external sea level trend in the longest tide-gauge records worldwide. We apply this new method to distinguish between the trend-like natural oscillations and the external trends in the longest available sea level records and in global mean sea level reconstructions. The results show that the long-term persistence impacts strongly on sea level rise estimation. We provide statistical evidences that the observed sea level changes, at global and regional scales, are beyond its natural internal variability and cannot be explained without human influence. We found that sea level change during the past century contains an external component at 99% significance level in two thirds of the available longest tidal records worldwide. The anthropogenic sea level trend is about 1 mm/yr in global sea level reconstructions that is more than half of the total observed sea level trend during the XXth century, which is about 1.7 mm/yr. This work provides the first estimate of the minimal anthropogenic contribution to the observed sea level rise, which is crucial for developing climate adaptation strategies and for understanding human influence on the Earth climate.",

            "abstract": "Solar-powered automated flux station was deployed continuously inside the Bluff Road Landfill (Lincoln, NE) for the period of over4 years starting June 2010. Landfill methane emissions were measured using the eddy covariance method, reporting hourly emission rates. The data shown in this presentation are from the period of June to December 2010 when no gas recovery was in operation. The continuous measurements of hourly emission rates allowed a number of important analyses of the key factors affecting landfill methane emissions at different time scales.\nIn particular, the results show that landfill methane emissions strongly depended on changes in barometric pressure. Rising barometric pressure suppressed the emission, while falling barometric pressure enhanced the emission, resulting in up to a 35-fold variation in day-to-day methane emissions. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed a strong spectral coherency between variations of barometric pressure and methane emission at periodicities ranging from 1 day to 8 days. Power spectrum and ogive analysis showed that at least 10 days of continuous measurements was needed in order to capture 90% of the total variance in the methane emission time series at the site.\nFrom these results, it is apparent that point-in-time measurements taken at monthly or longer time intervals using techniques such as the trace plume method, the mass balance method, or the closed-chamber method will be subject to large variations in measured emission rates because of the barometric pumping phenomenon. Estimates of long-term integrated methane emissions based on such measurements could yield uncertainties, ranging from 28% underestimation to 32% overestimation.\nThe results demonstrate a need for continuous measurements to quantify annual total landfill emissions. This conclusion may also apply to the wetlands, peatlands, lakes, and other environments where emissions are from porous media or ebullition. ",

            "abstract": "The September 2013 Mw7.7 Balochistan strike-slip earthquake ruptured a ~200 km long segment of the curved Hoshab fault within the Makran accretionary prism – the active zone of convergence between the northward subducting Arabia plate and overriding Eurasia. The Hoshab fault ruptured bilaterally with ~10 m of mean sinistral and ~1.7 m of dip slip along the length of the rupture, quantified jointly from geodetic and seismological observations. This rupture is unusual because the fault dips ~60o towards the focus of a small circle centered in northwest Pakistan, and, despite a 30o increase in obliquity along the curving strike of the fault with respect to Arabia:Eurasia convergence, the ratio of strike and dip slip remain relatively uniform. Static friction prior to rupture was unusually weak ( <0.05) as inferred from topographic and slab profiles, and friction may have approached zero during dynamic rupture, thus permitting in part this unusual event. In this presentation, we argue that the northward dipping Hosab fault defines the northern rim of a structural unit in southeast Makran. This unit rotates – akin to a 2-D ball-and-socket joint – counter clockwise in response to India’s penetration into the Eurasia plate. According to this interpretation, the mechanically weak Makran accretionary prism is subjected to a highly heterogeneous strain and deforms in response to convergence from both the Arabia and India plates. Rotation of the southeast Makran block accounts for complexity in the Chaman fault system and, in principle, reduces the seismic potential near Karachi by accommodating some slip along the southern Ornach-Nal fault. At the same time, geological indicators and along-strike fault slip profiles indicate that the Hoshab fault may also slip as a reverse fault in response to Arabia:Eurasia convergence – indicating that a single fault may accommodate multiple components of strain partitioning in a heterogeneous strain field over several seismic cycles.",

            "abstract": "For the past three decades, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) has administered a succession of programs intended to improve undergraduate STEM education for all students. The IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) program is the latest program in this succession, and reflects an expanded, NSF-wide effort to make sustainable improvements in STEM education on a national scale. The origins and thinking behind IUSE can be in part traced back to precursor programs including: ILI (Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement), CCD (Course and Curriculum Development), UFE (Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement), CCLI (Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement), and TUES (Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM), all of which sought to support faculty efforts to investigate and improve curriculum and instructional practice in undergraduate STEM education, and to disseminate effective STEM educational practices for broad adoption. IUSE, like its predecessor programs, is open to all STEM fields, and as such is intended to support improvements in geoscience education, spanning the atmospheric, ocean, and Earth sciences, as well as in environmental science, GIS science, climate change and sustainability/resilience. An emphasis on discipline-based research on learning that had origins in the CCLI and TUES programs is a new priority area in IUSE, with the ambition that projects will take advantage of the integrated expertise of domain scientists, educational practioners, and experts in learning science.\nWe trace and describe the history of undergraduate education efforts with an emphasis placed on the recently introduced IUSE program. Understanding the origin of DUE's IUSE program can provide insights for faculty interested in developing proposals for submission and gain a greater appreciation of trends and priorities within the division.",

Long-term datasets reveal important patterns for scientists to explain and are essential for testing hypotheses undreamt of at the time monitoring scheme was set up. Many environmental processes take place over relatively long periods of time; very often, subtle processes are embedded within highly variable systems so that their weak signal cannot be extracted without a long record.\nSlapton Ley is a freshwater coastal lagoon in SW England. The Ley is part of a National Nature Reserve, wetland 116 ha in area which is divided into two basins: the Higher Ley (39 ha) is mainly reed swamp; the Lower Ley (77 ha) is open water. In the 1960s it became apparent that the Ley was becoming increasingly eutrophic. In order to gauge water, sediment and nutrient inputs into the lake, measurements began on the main catchments in late 1969. Continuous monitoring of discharge and a weekly water-sampling programme have been maintained by the Slapton Ley Field Centre ever since. The monitoring programme has been supplemented by a number of research projects which have sought to identify the salient hydrological processes operating within the Slapton catchments and to relate these to the delivery of sediment and solute to the stream system.\nThe nitrate issue has been of particular interest at Slapton; although many longer series exist for large rivers like the Thames, the long record of nitrate data for the Slapton catchments is unique in Britain for small rural basins. Other issues to be explored will be the phosphorus legacy in lake sediments and a long-term decline in lake pH. The Slapton water quality record has confirmed that undesirable changes are taking place, revealed evidence of important patterns to be explained, allowed testing of new hypotheses (e.g. links with land-use change) and helped provide strategies for more successful management of the catchment area.",

            "abstract": "As on the terrestrial planets, key clues to the origin of Titan’s enigmatic atmosphere are contained in the abundances of noble gases and stable isotopes in the atmosphere. The Huygens GCMS measured the abundances of 40Ar, 36Ar, and 22Ne (tentatively); as well as the nitrogen and carbon isotopic compositions of atmospheric N2 and CH4, respectively. No isotopes of Kr or Xe were detected (<10 ppbv). Cassini CIRS has provided us with the D/H ratio in CH4. Here, I attempt to explain these data by developing the hypothesis that the noble gases, nitrogen, and methane originated in the rocky core of Titan [1]. The presence of 40Ar demonstrates that volatile species can be delivered from the deep interior to the atmosphere. Consistent with [2], I find that Titan’s primordial core should have contained sufficient 36Ar and 22Ne to explain their reported abundances. By extrapolating this model, I provide a new explanation for why the GCMS failed to detect Kr or Xe, as the predicted mixing ratios of 84Kr and 132Xe are ~0.2 ppbv and ~0.01 ppbv, respectively. I find that nitrogen should be outgassed similarly to argon, while krypton can serve as a geochemical proxy for methane, given the similar volatilities of these pairs of substances. This allows me to deduce that geochemical reactions in Titan’s core could have generated enough N2 and CH4 from accreted NH3 and CO2, respectively. A hydrothermal origin of atmospheric nitrogen is also supported by the similarity in N isotopes between Titan’s N2 and cometary NH3 [3]. I find that the isotopic ratios in methane can be explained by low-temperature (~300 K) equilibria with liquid water and the alteration mineral calcite. Looking toward the future, this model predicts 12C/13C ≈ 84 in dry ice, and D/H ≈ 170 ppm in water ice on Titan’s surface. ",

            "abstract": "Rising global temperatures are profoundly impacting alpine environments by shifting the precipitation type and the timing of peak snowmelt runoff. Uncertainty in the magnitude of these shifts translates to uncertainty in how climate change affects timing of snowmelt runoff, and hence availability of surface water during the remainder of the year. Integrated hydrologic models are useful tools for capturing these feedbacks by closing the loop between atmosphere, land surface, and subsurface dynamics. Recent integrated models have been used to predict streamflow response to climate change in mountain basins, however these models assume that shallow, local flow paths comprise the majority of recharge and baseflow to streams. Several studies have challenged this assumption with discordant groundwater ages and hysteresis loops, suggesting that deep, regional flow paths may play a more substantial role even at the local stream scale. This would have considerable implications for predicted responses to climate change in alpine basins, as deep, regional groundwater would initially buffer perturbations, but exhibit greater memory over the long-term. The goal of this study is to understand how various hydrogeological settings will control the relative feedbacks to climate change.\nThis research uses three simplified, conceptual hillslope models: a “fast” draining, low storage, granodiorite similar to that of of the Sierra Nevada or Himalayan mountain range, a “slow” draining, high storage basalt of the Cascade or Andes Range, and a vertically homogeneous “base” case. The relative response of these hillslopes to three future climate scenarios: warm, warm and dry, and warm and wet are tested using ParFlow, an integrated surface water-groundwater model, coupled with CLM, a land surface model. These models will help quantify the relative feedbacks of deep groundwater in various hydrogeologic settings and will ultimately be scaled up to assess the 3-D, transient response of deep groundwater to climate change in a regional alpine system.",

            "abstract": "Elevated low-relief landscapes are often interpreted as “relic” and characteristics such as low erosion rates or low relief are assumed to reflect pre-uplift tectonic conditions. We present here an alternative model whereby high elevation, low-relief landscapes develop in situ by purely fluvial processes. We argue that changes in tectonic regime result in change of uplift rate, but also deform the surface, thereby inducing changes in the river channel network through capture and divide migration. Loss of drainage area leads to lower erosion rate through lower river discharge and thus to higher surface uplift rate as erosion fails to keep up with tectonic uplift. Branches of a river network that lose area are thus raised to higher elevation where they have a predisposition towards further area loss, triggering a positive feedback, potentially including runaway conditions in which erosion rates and drainage area tend towards zero. Such conditions produce high-elevation, low relief, low erosion-rate branches of a river network that could be misconstrued as relic landscapes. We test this model by analyzing river profiles of several previously identified relic landscapes in the eastern Tibetan plateau region and in the Central Range of Taiwan. We apply two tests. First we check kinematic wave travel times to the relic and surrounding regions to test if there is a common uplift history with an increase in uplift rate that has not yet reached the relic. Second, we measure the channel steepness and channel profiles inside and outside the relic region to test for divide mobility and evidence of area capture. In every case examined, we find no common uplift history and widespread evidence that divides surrounding a relic landscape are moving inward, pirating drainage area and lowering erosion rates. This supports the model for in situ formation of these landscapes by progressive drainage area loss.",

As a successful collaboration involving Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO),Office of Naval Research (ONR), and San Marcos Middle School (SMMS), IFRR brings physical oceanography and related sciences to students at the San Marcos Middle School in real-time from research vessels at sea using SIO's HiSeasNet satellite communication system. With a generous grant from ONR, students are able to tour the SIO Ships and spend a day at sea doing real oceanographic data collection and labs. Through real-time and near-realtime broadcasts and webcasts, students are able to share data with scientists and gain an appreciation for the value of Biogeochemical research in the field as it relates to their classroom studies. Interaction with scientists and researchers as well as crew members gives students insights into not only possible career paths, but the vital importance of cutting edge oceanographic research on our society.\nWith their science teacher on the ship as an education outreach specialist or ashore guiding students in their interactions with selected scientists at sea, students observe shipboard research being carried out live via videoconference, Skype, daily e-mails, interviews, digital whiteboard sessions, and web interaction. Students then research, design, develop, deploy, and field-test their own data-collecting physical oceanography instruments in their classroom. The online interactive curriculum models the Next Generation Science Standards encouraging active inquiry and critical thinking with intellectually stimulating problem- solving, enabling students to gain critical insight and skill while investigating some of the most provocative questions of our time, and seeing scientists as role-models. IFRR has provided students in the San Diego area with a unique opportunity for learning about oceanographic research, which could inspire students to become oceanographers or at least scientifically literate citizens, a benefit for our society at large.",

            "abstract": "Microzonation, i.e. the estimation of (shear) wave velocity profiles of the upper few 100m in dense 2D surface grids is one of the key methods to understand the variation in seismic hazard caused by ground shaking events. In this presentation we introduce a novel method for estimating the Love-wave phase velocity dispersion by using ambient noise recordings. We use the vertical component of rotational motions inherently present in ambient noise and the well established relation to simultaneous recordings of transverse acceleration. In this relation the frequency dependent phase velocity of a plane SH (or Love)-type wave acts as a proportionality factor between the anti-correlated amplitudes of both measures. In a first step we used synthetic data sets with increasing complexity to evaluate the proposed technique and the developed algorithm to extract the direction and amplitude of the incoming ambient noise wavefield measured at a single site. Since reliable weak rotational motion sensors are not yet readily available, we apply array derived rotation measurements in order to test our method. We next use the technique to analyze different real data sets of ambient noise measurements as well as seismic recordings at active volcanoes and compare these results with findings of the Spatial AutoCorrelation technique which was applied to the same data set. We demonstrate that the newly developed technique shows comparable results to more classical, strictly array based methods. Furthermore, we show that as soon as portable weak motion rotational motion sensors are available, a single 6C-station approach will be feasible, not only for microzonation but also for general array applications, with performance comparable to more classical techniques. An important advantage, especially in urban environments, is that with this approach, the number of seismic stations needed is drastically reduced.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we present the major geomorphological features of comet Churymov-Gerasimenko (C-G), with emphasis on those that may have formed through collisional processes. The C-G nucleus has been imaged with the Rosetta/OSIRIS camera system at varying spatial resolution. At the moment of this writing the maximum spatial resolution achieved is ~20 meter per pixel, and it will improve to reach the unprecedented centimeter-scale in November 2014. This resolution should allow us to identify and characterize pits, lineaments and blocks that could be the result of collisional evolution. Indeed, C-G has spent some 1000 years on orbits crossing the main asteroid belt, and a much longer time in the outer solar system. Collisions may have, therefore, shaped the morphology of the nucleus in various ways. Previously imaged Jupiter Family Comets (e.g., Tempel 1) show significant numbers of pits and lineaments, some of which could be due to collisions. Additional proposed formation mechanisms are related to cometary activity processes, such as volatile outgassing.\nIn addition to small scale features, the overall shape of C-G could also provide insights into the role of collisional processes. A striking feature is that C-G's shape is that of a contact binary. Similar shapes have been observed on rocky asteroids (e.g., Itokawa) and are generally interpreted as an indication of their rubble pile nature. A possibility is that C-G underwent similar processes, and therefore it may be constituted by reaccumulated fragments ejected from a larger precursor. An alternative view is that the current shape is the result of inhomogeneous outgassing activity, which may have dug a ~1-km deep trench responsible for the apparent contact binary shape.\nThe role of the various proposed formation mechanisms (collisional vs outgassing) for both small scale and global features will be investigated and their implications for the evolution of C-G will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The nature of reversals of the geomagnetic field and the details of the transition fields remain controversial. However, reversal records from the Agno batholith and Tatoosh intrusion confirm the suggestion of Valet et al., (2012) from studies of lava records, that there is a threefold division in reversal transition directions. In the Agno, the first phase, or precursor, consists of a CCW loop of the VGP moving from high southerly latitude reverse poles to reach North America. The second phase takes the VGP along a half CCW loop from the tip of South America to northern latitudes at the intensity minimum. The third phase, or rebound is a smaller CCW loop and the main intensity recovery begins. The first and third phases appear to be paleosecular variation loops analogous to present London-Paris secular variation loops. The Tatoosh intrusion gives a similar, but less complete record with the VGPs again confined to the East Pacific and the Americas. Away from the reversal region, secular variation loops in the Tatoosh were shown to be comparable in duration to the precursor in the transition record, consistent with the first phase being a paleosecular variation loop in the Agno. Using westward drift estimates from the present field, this should last about1800 years. This gives ~3300 for phase 2, in an intensity low of >16,000 years. A feature of R to N reversal field models is a low latitude magnetic field flux concentration of the same sign as the polar vortex of the south geographic pole. This is followed by northward flux flow, e.g. Shao et al., (1999). The reversal is achieved by northward motion of this flux feature. The feature is locked in longitudinal mantle coordinates and similarly the VGPs in the Agno and Tatoosh records are confined to the longitudes of the eastern Pacific and the Americas. Whether we are approaching a reversal remains to be seen, although judging by these intrusion records the field intensity would need to decrease much further before major directional changes should take place. In the Agno record, these changes start near to the intensity minimum. In the Tatoosh record, the field decreases by an order of magnitude before the major directional changes take place.",

            "abstract": "Dam removals featuring unchecked releases of non-cohesive sediments are excellent opportunities to learn more about stream channel response to abrupt increases in bed material supply that can occur deliberately or by natural processes like landslides and volcanic eruptions. Understanding channel response to sediment pulses, including response rates, is essential because human uses of river channels and floodplains are impacted by these events as are aquatic habitats. We had the opportunity to study a dam removal site at the Simkins Dam in Maryland, USA, that shares many important geophysical attributes of another well-studied dam removal in the humid northeast United States [Merrimack Village Dam, New Hampshire; Pearson et al., 2011]. The watershed sizes are the same order of magnitude (102 km2), and at both sites relatively low head dams were removed (~ 3-4 m) and ~60,000 m3 of dominantly sand-sized sediments discharged to low-gradient reaches immediately downstream. Analyzing four years of repeat morphometry and bed sediment grain size surveys at the Simkins site on the Patapsco River, as well as continuous discharge and suspended sediment gaging data, we clearly document a two-phase response in the upstream reach as described by Pearson et al. [2011] for their New Hampshire site and noted at other dam removals [e.g., Major et al., 2012]. In the early phase, approximately 50% of the impounded sediment mass was eroded rapidly over a period of about three months when flows were very modest (Figure 1). After incision to base level and channel widening in the former impoundment, a second phase began when further erosion depended on floods large enough to access impounded sediments more distant from the newly-formed channel. We also found important differences in the upstream responses at the Maryland and New Hampshire sites that appear to be related to valley type (non-glaciated versus glaciated, respectively). Response variances immediately downstream between the respective sites are potentially related to local gradient and hydraulics.",

In this presentation we introduce a new dataset: the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science Center. This new quasi-global precipitation product is available at daily to seasonal time scales, with a spatial resolution of 0.05°, and a 1981 to near real-time period of record. The three main types of information used in the CHIRPS are: (1) global 0.05° precipitation climatologies, (2) time-varying grids of infrared cold cloud duration (CCD) precipitation estimates, and (3) in situ precipitation observations.\nThe CHG has developed an extensive database of in situ daily, pentadal and monthly precipitation totals with over a billion daily observations worldwide. Most of these observations come from four sets: the monthly Global Historical Climate Network version 2, the daily Global Historical Climate Network, the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD), and the daily Global Telecommunication System (GTS) provided by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC). A screening procedure was developed to remove suspected “false zeros” from the daily GTS and GSOD data, since these data can artificially suppress rainfall totals.\nWe compare CHIRPS and ARC2, CFS-Reanalysis, CHIRP, CMORPH, CPC-Unified, ECMWF, PERSIANNE, RFE2, TAMSAT, TRMM-RT7, TRMM-V7 to GPCC. The CHIRPS is shown to have high correlation, low systematic errors (bias) and low mean absolute errors. The CHIRPS performance is similar to research quality products like the GPCC and GPCP, but with higher resolution and lower latency. Cross validation results for over 100 countries and comparisons with alternate algorithms will be presented.",

The models consist of multiple linear regressions calibrated using new data from H2O-undersaturated primitive and depleted mantle lherzolite melting experiments as well as experimental literature data. The models investigate the roles of H2O, Pressure, 1-Mg# (1-[XMg/(XMg+XFe)]), NaK# ((Na2O+K2O)/(Na2O+K2O+CaO)), TiO2, and Cr2O3 on mantle melt compositions. Melts are represented by the pseudoternary endmembers Clinopyroxene (Cpx), Olivine (Ol), Plagioclase (Plag), and Quartz (Qz) of Tormey et al. (1987). Model A returns predictive equations for the four endmembers with identical predictor variables, whereas Model B chooses predictor variables for the four compositional endmember equations and temperature independently. We employ the use of Akaike Information Criteria (Akaike, 1974) to determine the best predictor variables from initial variables chosen through thermodynamic reasoning and by previous models.\nIn both Models A and B, the coefficients for H2O show that increasing H2O drives the melt to more Qz normative space, as the Qz component increases by +0.012(3) per 1 wt.% H2O. The other endmember components decrease and are all three times less affected by H2O (Ol: -0.004(2); Cpx: -0.004(2); Plag: -0.004(3)). Consistent with previous models and experimental data, increasing pressure moves melt compositions to more Ol normative space at the expense of the Qz component. The models presented quantitatively determine the influence of H2O, Pressure, 1-Mg#, NaK#, TiO2, and Cr2O3 on mantle melts in equilibrium with ol+opx±sp; the equations presented can be used to predict melts of known mantle source compositions saturated in ol+opx±sp.\n",

This results in significantly different peatland vegetation communities across short distances, as well as differences in wetness, temperature and peat substrates. We have been measuring the spatially integrated CO2, heat and water vapour fluxes from this peatland complex using eddy covariance and the CO2 exchange from specific plant communities within the EC tower footprint since spring 2008. With this data we are examining if it is possible to derive the spatially integrated ecosystem-wide fluxes from community-level simple light use efficiency (LUE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) models. These models have been developed using several years of continuous autochamber flux measurements for the three major plant functional types (PFTs) as well as knowledge of the spatial variability of the vegetation, water table and active layer depths.\nLIDAR was used to produce a 1 m resolution digital evaluation model of the complex and the spatial distribution of PFTs was obtained from concurrent high-resolution digital colour air photography trained from vegetation surveys. Continuous water table depths have been measured for four years at over 40 locations in the complex, and peat temperatures and active layer depths are surveyed every 10 days at more than 100 locations. The EC footprint is calculated for every half-hour and the PFT based models are run with the corresponding environmental variables weighted for the PFTs within the EC footprint. Our results show that the Sphagnum, palsa, and sedge PFTs have distinctly different LUE models, and that the tower fluxes are dominated by a blend of the Sphagnum and palsa PFTs. We also see a distinctly different energy partitioning between the fetches containing intact palsa and those with thawed palsa: the evaporative efficiency is higher and the Bowen ration lower for the thawed palsa fetches.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic hazard mitigation at subduction zones critically depends on knowledge of magma generation and ascent processes and timescales. Two diametrically opposite scenarios are presently debated: One paradigm is the generation of low-silica (basaltic) melts in the mantle wedge, followed by protracted sub-liquidus magma ascent and evolution through crystal growth and fractionation in crustal reservoirs, which are tapped during volcanic eruptions. In contrast, a diametrically opposite model favours the generation of higher silica melts in the mantle or in a lower crustal hot zone, followed by rapid decompression to the surface under super-liquidus conditions. In the latter case, crystals are picked up during magma ascent, and are in the process of dissolving. We present multiple lines of evidence that point to crystal uptake as the principal processes by which arc melts acquire their crystal cargo: (i) variable 234U-238U disequilibria in mineral separates; (ii) hydrous mineral rims with amorphous alteration textures; and (iii) two-pyroxene pseudo-decompression paths; cf. Zellmer et al. (2014a,b,c), doi: 10.1144/SP385.3 and 10.1144/SP385.9 and 10.1144/SP410.1. These observations point to a scarcity of true phenocrysts in many arc magmas, and thus to decompression of aphyric melts that take up their crystal cargo during ascent. The data imply that many hydrous wedge melts are more silica-rich than basalts and achieve super-liquidus conditions during rapid ascent from great depth.",

In a hybrid plasma code, the ions are treated as kinetic Macro-particles moving under the Lorentz force and the electrons as a fluid leading to a generalized formulation of Ohm’s law. In this version, the spatial simulation domain is decomposed in 2 directions and is non-uniform in the plasma convection direction. The code is run on a multi-processor supercomputer that offers 16416 cores and 2GB Ram per core. This new version allows us to tap into the large memory of the supercomputer and simulate the full interaction volume (Reuropa=1561km) with a high spatial resolution (50km).\nCompared to Io, Europa’s atmosphere is about 100 times more tenuous, the ambient magnetic field is weaker and the density of incident plasma is lower. Consequently, the electrodynamic interaction is also weaker and substantial fluxes of thermal torus ions might reach and sputter the icy surface.\nMolecular O2 is the dominant atmospheric product of this surface sputtering. Observations of oxygen UV emissions (specifically the ratio of OI 1356A / 1304A emissions) are roughly consistent with an atmosphere that is composed predominantely of O2 with a small amount of atomic O.\nGalileo observations along flybys close to Europa have revealed the existence of induced currents in a conducting ocean under the icy crust. They also showed that, from flyby to flyby, the plasma interaction is very variable. Asymmetries of the plasma density and temperature in the wake of Europa were also observed and still elude a clear explanation. Galileo mag data also detected ion cyclotron waves, which is an indication of heavy ion pickup close to the moon.\nWe prescribe an O2 atmosphere with a vertical density column consistent with UV observations and model the plasma properties along several Galileo flybys of the moon. We compare our results with the magnetometer observations, PLS plasma measurements (ion density, temperature and bulk flow velocity) and PWS electron density measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Coast Mountains of southeast Alaska are currently experiencing high rates of glacier volume loss. Continued glacier wastage therefore has the potential to decrease the proportion of streamflow derived from glacial runoff, which could alter the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) delivered to proglacial streams. We collected snow from ten locations along a transect that extended from the coast 47 km across the Juneau Icefield, southeast Alaska and analyzed the snow for δ18O and DOM for 13C, 14C and fluorescence characteristics. Our goal was to assess the origin and quality of DOM in snow to better understand how continued glacial recession in the region may influence the transfer of organic matter to proglacial aquatic ecosystems. The δ18O of snow decreased with distance from the coast (r2=84, p<0.01) indicative of the natural fractionation or fallout of heavy δ18O that occurs along elevation or spatial gradients. This depletion in the isotopic signature of snow across the Icefield transect was reflected in the origin and quality of DOM. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied from 0.13 to 0.29 mg C L-1 and progressively decreased (r2=43, p<0.05) as δ18O became more depleted. The Δ14C-DOC varied from -742 to -420‰ and showed progressive depletion with decreasing δ18O (r2=56, p<0.01). Older DOC corresponded to a decrease in the percent contribution of humic-like fluorescence (r2=74, p<0.01) suggesting an overall decrease in modern continental DOM across the transect. A three-source isotope mixing model showed that DOM in snow originates mainly from anthropogenic aerosols from fossil fuel combustion (45-74%) and marine sources (17-34%). These results suggest that anthropogenic aerosols are a quantitatively important source of relic DOM to the glacier ecosystem. Given relic DOM exported from glaciers is highly bioavailable, anthropogenic aerosols could profoundly influence the transfer of DOM from glaciers to proglacial aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Improving resilience to drought in complex social-environmental systems (SES) is extraordinarily important, particularly for rural tropical locations where small changes in climate regimes can have dramatic SES impacts. Efforts to build drought resilience must necessarily be planned and implemented within SES governance systems that involve linkages in water and land use administration from local to national levels. These efforts require knowledge and understanding that links climate and weather forecasts to regional and local hydrology, to social-economic and environmental systems, and to governance processes. In order to provide structure for such complex choices and investments, we argue that a focus on structured decision processes that involve linkages among science, technological perspectives, and public values conducted with agencies and stakeholders will provide a crucial framework for comparing and building insight for pursuing alternative courses of action to build drought resilience. This paper focuses on a regional case study in the seasonally-dry northwest region of Costa Rica, in watersheds rated as most threatened in the country in terms of drought. We present the overall framework guiding the transdisciplinary efforts to link scientific and technical understanding to public values, in order to foster civil society actions that lead to improved drought resilience. Initial efforts to characterize hydrological and climate regimes will be reported along with our approach to linking natural science findings, social inventories in terms of perspectives on SES, and the psychology and patterns of reliance on forecast information that provide the basis for characterizing public understanding. The overall linkage of technical and value information is focused on creating and comparing alternative actions that can potentially build resilience in short and long time frames by building decision making processes involving stakeholders, agencies and interested parties.",

AirSWOT is the airborne calibration/validation instrument for SWOT with first-pass data collected over the Sacramento River in May 2013 and a wetland complex on Edwards AFB (Piute Ponds) in May 2014. Here, AirSWOT elevation and coherence data are compared with high resolution airborne imagery and concurrent in-situ field mappings of inundation area and water surface elevation. For the Sacramento River, AirSWOT water surface elevations are compared with field-surveyed elevations collected using a high precision GPS Lagrangian river drifter escorted down 30 km of river length. Additionally, field mapped river shorelines are compared with shorelines extracted from AirSWOT coherence data. For the Piute Ponds, we use an exhaustive field mapping of inundation extent and flooded vegetation to assess the ability of AirSWOT coherence and backscatter to map shorelines in a complex lake and wetland environment containing varying vegetation and soil moisture conditions.",

            "abstract": "Statistical analyses of paleomagnetic data from sequential lava flows allow us to study the geomagnetic field behaviour on kyr to Myr timescales. Previous paleomagnetic studies lack high-latitude, high-quality measurements and the resolution necessary to investigate the persistence of high-latitude geomagnetic field anomalies observed in the recent and historical field records, and replicated in some numerical geodynamo simulations. As part of the Time-Averaged Field Initiative (TAFI) project, lava sequences exposed in Nordurdalur (by Fljótsdalur) and Jökuldalur in eastern Iceland provide an excellent opportunity to improve high-latitude data suitable for investigating the 6-0.5 Ma TAF and paleosecular variation. These adjacent valleys, separated by 40 km, host a composite stratigraphic record of lava flows erupted from the Northern Rift Zone between 0.5 and ~6.5 Ma (one lava flow extruded every ~15-40 kyr). Hiatuses are present locally in the younger sections, at ~0.9 Ma and 2 Ma (spanning 200-400 kyr), that contain frequent hyaloclastites and sediments. In 2013, we collected a total of ~2200 cores (10-18 cores/site; mean = ~13 cores/site) from ~140 separate lava flows (165 in total) along eight stratigraphic profiles in Nordurdalur and Jökuldalur. In addition, hand samples were collected from ~70 sites to deliver new 40Ar/39Ar radiometric age determinations. We present the final results of AF- and thermal demagnetization of ~10 specimens/flow, comprising 165 (~140 distinct) paleomagnetic directions, along with updated composite litho-, chrono- and magnetostratigraphy of the exposed volcanic pile in Nordurdalur and Jökuldalur. We present the dispersion of the Arctic virtual geomagnetic poles over the last 6.5 Ma. In addition, we present a number of new IZZI paleointensity results from Jökuldalur. The geomagnetic results are compared and contrasted with other high-latitude data.",

            "abstract": "Vapor-saturated melting experiments have been performed at pressures near the base of the mantle wedge (3.2 GPa). The starting composition is a metasomatized lherzolite containing 3 wt. % H2O. Near-solidus melts and coexisting mineral phases have been characterized in experiments that span 925 to 1100 oC with melt % varying from 6 to 9 wt. %. Olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet coexist with melt over the entire interval and rutile is also present at < 1000 oC. Melt is andesitic in composition and varies from 60 wt. % SiO2 at 950 oC to 52 wt. % at 1075 oC. The Al2O3 contents of the melt are 13 to 14 wt. %, and CaO contents range from 1 and 4 wt. %. Melting is peritectic with orthopyroxene + liquid produced by melting of garnet + olivine + high-Ca pyroxene. In addition to quenched melt, we observe a quenched silicate component that is rhyolitic (>72 % SiO2) that we interpret as a precipitate from the coexisting supercritical H2O-rich vapor. Extrapolation of the measured compositional variation toward the solidus suggests that the first melt may be very SiO2 rich (i.e., granitic). We suggest that these granitic melts are the first melts of the mantle near the slab-wedge interface. As these SiO2-rich melts ascend into shallower, hotter overlying mantle, they continue to interact with the surrounding mantle and evolve in composition. These first melts may elucidate the geochemical and physical processes that accompany the beginnings of H2O flux melting.",

We will survey the effects of this on (1) soybean farmers, (2) cattle ranchers, (3) small-scale farm families, (4) rural non-agriculturists, including fishers, and (5) urban residents and map their roles as stakeholders. We will also conduct current water use surveys among the different stakeholder groups, accompanied by questions on desired aspects for future freshwater security to identify targets for desirable outcomes of water governance strategies. These targets, together with the information on land use drivers, water quantity and quality and predicted scenarios for global changes will be incorporated into a fully integrated and interactive geospatially oriented socio-ecological model that can serve as framework for future water governance that enhances Freshwater Security in such systems.

            "abstract": "A stochastic Arctic sea-ice model is derived and analysed in detail to interpret the recent decay and associated variability of Arctic sea-ice under changes in radiative forcing.\nThe approach begins from a deterministic model of the heat flux balance through the air/sea/ice system, which uses observed monthly-averaged heat fluxes\nto drive a time evolution of sea-ice thickness. This model reproduces the observed seasonal cycle of the ice cover and it is to this that stochastic noise--representing high frequency variability--is introduced.\nThe model takes the form of a single periodic non-autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equation. The value of such a model is that it provides a relatively simple framework to examine the role of noise in the basic nonlinear interactions at play as transitions in the state of the ice cover (e.g., from perennial to seasonal) are approached. Moreover, the stability and the noise conspire to underlie the inter annual variability and how that variability changes as one approaches the deterministic bifurcations in the system.",

            "abstract": "Data from NSF’s EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), and similar GPS networks worldwide, can be used to monitor the terrestrial water cycle. GPS satellites transmit L-band microwave signals, which are affected by water at Earth’s surface. GPS signals take two paths: (1) the “direct” signal travels from the satellite to the antenna; (2) the “reflected” signal interacts with the Earth’s surface before travelling to the antenna. The direct signal is used by geophysicists to measure position of the antenna, while the effects of reflected signals are generally ignored. Recently, our group has developed a technique to retrieve terrestrial water cycle variables from GPS reflections. The sensing footprint is intermediate in scale between in situ and remote sensing observations. Soil moisture, snow depth, and an index of vegetation water content are estimated from data collected at over 400 PBO sites. The products are updated daily and are available online. This presentation provides a description of the soil moisture product.\nNear-surface soil moisture is estimated at more than 100 sites in the PBO H2O network. At each site, a geodetic-quality GPS antenna records the interference pattern between the direct and ground-reflected GPS signals in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) interferograms. The ground-reflected GPS signal is altered by changes in the permittivity of the ground surface, which is primarily a function of its water content. Temporal changes in the SNR interferogram, primarily its phase, are indicative of changes in soil moisture. SNR phase data are converted to soil moisture using relationships determined using an electrodynamic model. Soil moisture is not retrieved when there is snow or significant vegetation (> ~1 kg m-2 of vegetation water), as both affect SNR phase. When there is moderate vegetation, a correction is applied to the phase data before conversion to soil moisture. The effect of vegetation on SNR phase and the exact relationship between SNR phase and soil moisture are the primary sources of error. At sites where seasonal variations in vegetation water content are < 0.5 kg m-2, validation surveys show that the RMSE between in situ and GPS soil moisture estimates is < 0.04 cm3 cm-3. Therefore, soil moisture data from these sites could be utilized for satellite validation and other applications.",

            "abstract": "The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) will penetrate the Antarctic ice sheets in order to core through deep ice, the glacial bed, and into bedrock below. This new technology will provide a critical first look at the interface between major ice caps and their subglacial geology. Currently in construction, RAID is a mobile drilling system capable of making several long boreholes in a single field season in Antarctica. RAID is interdisciplinary and will allow access to polar paleoclimate records in ice >1 Ma, direct observation at the base of the ice sheets, and recovery of rock cores from the ice-covered East Antarctic craton. RAID uses a diamond rock-coring system as in mineral exploration. Threaded drill-pipe with hardened metal bits will cut through ice using reverse circulation of Estisol for pressure-compensation, maintenance of temperature, and removal of ice cuttings. Near the bottom of the ice sheet, a wireline bottom-hole assembly will enable diamond coring of ice, the glacial bed, and bedrock below. Once complete, boreholes will be kept open with fluid, capped, and made available for future down-hole measurement of thermal gradient, heat flow, ice chronology, and ice deformation. RAID will also sample for extremophile microorganisms. RAID is designed to penetrate up to 3,300 meters of ice and take sample cores in less than 200 hours. This rapid performance will allow completion of a borehole in about 10 days before moving to the next drilling site. RAID is unique because it can provide fast borehole access through thick ice; take short ice cores for paleoclimate study; sample the glacial bed to determine ice-flow conditions; take cores of subglacial bedrock for age dating and crustal history; and create boreholes for use as an observatory in the ice sheets. Together, the rapid drilling capability and mobility of the drilling system, along with ice-penetrating imaging methods, will provide a unique 3D picture of the interior Antarctic ice sheets.",

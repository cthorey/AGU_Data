            "abstract": "The Global Land-Atmosphere Climate Experiment–Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (GLACE-CMIP5) is a multimodel experiment investigating the impact of soil moisture-climate feedbacks in CMIP5 simulations (Seneviratne et al. 2013). This experiment builds upon previous studies investigating the role of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions for seasonal forecasting (Koster et al. 2004) and for regional climate projections (Seneviratne et al. 2006). A total of 6 modeling groups took part in the experiment (CESM, EC-EARTH, GFDL, IPSL, MPI-ESM, and more recently ACCESS). The results reveal that projected soil moisture changes by the end of the 21st century substantially impact climate in several regions on both hemispheres, both under present and future climate conditions. Strong and consistent effects are found on temperature, especially for extremes (about 1– 1.5K for mean temperature and 2– 2.5K for extreme daytime temperature). In the Northern Hemisphere, effects on mean and heavy precipitation are also found in most models, but the results are less consistent than for temperature. A direct scaling between soil moisture induced changes in evaporative cooling and resulting changes in temperature mean and extremes is found in the simulations. Further results from more recent analyses, especially regarding impacts on extremes will be discussed. The presentation will also address the implications of these results for climate extremes attribution and climate change adaptation, as well as follow-up activities under CMIP6.\n",

            "abstract": "Dipolarization fronts (DFs), earthward-propagating structures in the Earth's magnetotail with sharp enhancements of the northward magnetic field, can reflect and accelerate ions in the ambient plasma sheet. The ion reflection and acceleration process, which generates earthward flows ahead of the DF, also imposes a dynamic pressure on the DF to decelerate its earthward motion. It has been shown that the ion reflection process is not symmetric, with stronger ion accelerations at the evening side of the DF than at its morning side, which implies dawn-dusk asymmetric reaction of the ambient plasma and consequently dawnward diversion of DFs.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric data have proven invaluable in understanding the carbon cycle at global scales using trends in atmospheric mole fractions, and very local scales using eddy covariance measurements. Intermediate spatial domains remain challenging. Significant progress has been made in estimating regional sources and sinks of GHG, particularly when high data densities are available to constrain integrative modeling systems. These regional estimates, however, have not yet found much utility outside of the academic community working to develop these methods.\nWe will review the current state of regional inferences of GHG sources and sinks including flux tower upscaling and regional atmospheric inversions, focusing especially on uncertainty assessment. Numerous flux tower upscaling products and a smaller number of regional atmospheric inversions have been produced in recent years. These vary greatly in terms of their data density, uncertainty, and method of uncertainty assessment. Arguably, none to date have reached the level of a data product that can be used to evaluate models or rigorously identify changes in fluxes over time and space. We will assess the prospects for obtaining rigorous uncertainty estimates that can move these products out of the realm of methodological experimentation and towards operational assessment of regional GHG sources and sinks. Our review will include examples drawn from recent experiments including the NACP interim syntheses, the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study, the NACP Midcontinental Intensive, and the Indianapolis Flux Experiment.",

            "abstract": "Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) waves/vortices and magnetic flux ropes at Earth's magnetopause are important ingredients in the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. KH instabilities are excited in a velocity shear layer, leading to an undulation of the magnetopause or inner edge of its boundary layer and eventually to the formation of flow vortices, while flux ropes are generated in a current sheet through a time-dependent form of magnetic reconnection, which interconnect the field lines on both sides of the magnetopause. Because of their two- or three-dimensional nature, in-depth observational studies have become possible only with the advent of multi-spacecraft missions such as Cluster and THEMIS. We discuss similarities/differences of these two phenomena and the roles of these processes in the transfer of mass, momentum, and energy across the magnetopause, in particular with regard to the formation of the low-latitude boundary layer. Recent advances in studies of three-dimensional effects on these phenomena, effects of nonlinear evolution of the KH instability on magnetic reconnection and flux rope generation, and dawn-dusk symmetry/asymmetry in and IMF dependence of the occurrence of nonlinear (overturned) KH waves are also presented.",

            "abstract": "The remote southern ocean regions are often described as being pristine. Here we use global aerosol model simulations to define what we mean by pristine in terms of aerosol concentrations and behaviour. The model results show that the processes and emissions controlling cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) over the southern oceans vary substantially with season and with location. In the true Southern Ocean (south of 60 degrees) much of CCN derives from sulfate aerosol entrained into the boundary layer from the free troposphere, but sea spray emissions dominate further north. The Southern Ocean is the part of the atmosphere where CCN concentrations show the highest sensitivity to variations in DMS emissions, although only part of the seasonal variation can be attributed to changes in biological activity, with the rest coming from variations in atmospheric circulation and particle formation. We define the pristineness of the aerosol system in terms of how closely it resembles conditions in the unperturbed pre-industrial period. By this definition, large parts of the southern oceans are pristine in the southern hemisphere summer, but the aerosol system may be significantly perturbed by anthropogenic emissions in winter. Using a multi-parameter sensitivity analysis we explore to what extent these variations in pristineness affect the aerosol processes, and whether the remote southern ocean is a good analogue for pre-industrial marine aerosols in other parts of the world.",

It is a basic determinant of the terrestrial thermal behaviour, as it controls the effective radiating temperature of the Earth’s surface. The sensitivity of LST to soil moisture and vegetation cover means it is an important component in numerous applications. With the demand for LST data from Earth Observation currently experiencing considerable growth it is important that the users of this data are appropriately engaged by the LST data providers.\nThe GlobTemperature project under the Data User Element of ESA's 4th Earth Observation Envelope Programme (2013-2017) aims to promote the wider uptake of global-scale satellite LST by the research and operational user communities; the key to success depending on the coherence and openness of the interactions between the LST and user communities. By incorporating detailed user input into the specifications, their subsequent testing of the LST data sets, and sustained access to data in a user-friendly manner through common data formats GlobTemperature is enhancing the portfolio of LST products from Earth Observation, while concurrently breaking down the barriers to successful application of such data through its programme of dialogue between the data providers and data users.\nHere we present the outcomes from the first phase of the project, which is achieving some innovative developments: a globally representative and consistent matchup database enabling validation and intercomparison of multi-sensor LST data sets; a prototype combined geostationary earth orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) global data set for LST to resolve the diurnal cycle which is a key request from users of LST data; the delivery of the first LST data sets via a dedicated Data Portal in harmonised data format; and the establishment, in collaboration with international colleagues of a first working group (ILSTE-WG) dedicated to LST and Emissivity, whereby user evaluation of products by climate services aims to provide a thrust to sustained operational support of this group meeting a critical need amongst users of LST data.",

            "abstract": "We collected thermal video for 31 explosions at Stromboli during 2012 and 2014. We obtain a statistically robust database of size, mass and velocity for 83 000 particles. Statistically, the distribution for all parameters for 2012 is similar to that obtained for 2014. Most particles have sizes of 5 to 15 cm, so that the majority of individual bomb masses are below 0.4 kg. However, 4950 (6 %) of the particles are heavier than 5 kg and represent 59 % of the total mass erupted\nThe particle velocity distribution is Gaussian with a mode of 20 to 30 m/s. Explosive activity at Stromboli has been viewed as involving large particles with low velocities (mean = 25 m/s). Recently, various studies have shown that a few lapilli-sized particles can be ejected as part of an initial high velocity gas-jet, which has average velocities of 80 m/s and a maximum of 405 m/s. Our data support this duality. Our spatial resolution allows us to detect particles down to 5 cm. Thus, we assume that all of the bombs are detected and that the bomb velocity distribution has a mode of 20 to 30 m/s. However, we also show that the smallest particles have the highest velocities with a maximum speed of 240 m/s, and a projected maximum of 456 m/s.\nStromboli’s explosions have been classified by visual clustering; depending on whether they are ballistic dominated (Type 1), ash dominated, with (2a) or without (2b) particles, or gas-dominated (Type 0). We used our parameters to cluster the explosions into 3 classes: Type 2a, 2b and Type 0. Correlation with seismic data now help to understand the source mechanism, and support recent models whereby Type 2a and 2b events are a consequence of the presence of a viscous, degassed cap at the head of the magma column, its fragmentation providing 103 to 104 kg of solid material to the plume in each eruption. However, Type 0 are a consequence of slug bursting in a “cleaner” conduit, the cap having been lost by convective overturn.",

            "abstract": "For the evolution of the Cenozoic high northern latitude paleo-climate, the development of the North Atlantic – Arctic Ocean interactions including its southern (Faeroe – Shetland channel) and northern (Fram Strait) gateways were vital. In this paper we review the timing of inflow of paleo-Atlantic water into the Norwegian – Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean using the development of ocean current controlled contourite drift deposition as a proxy. In the early Miocene, drift growth accelerated in the Rockall Trough and in the Faroe-Shetland Channel interpreted to be related to the opening of the Faeroe – Shetland channel and establish a deep-water passage across the Greenland – Shetland Ridge. To the north, offshore Norway, growth of the Lofoten Drift has been estimated from mid-Miocene although age control is sparse in this area. No drift development has been reported from the SW Barents Sea continental slope while offshore the NW part of the Barents Sea slope, drift growth seems to have come in later, at ~1.3 Ma. North of the Fram Strait gateway, drift growth has been inferred from at least mid-Miocene (~11 Ma). Studies from the central Arctic Ocean shows ventilated surface water conditions from ~17.5 Ma ascribed to the opening of the Fram Strait which was a narrow oceanic corridor during early Miocene (20 – 15 Ma) and where the onset of sea floor spreading and the establishment of a deep-water corridor has been suggested to start from late Miocene (~10 Ma). Other, more recent studies have, however, reported evidence for the development of an initial deep-water gateway through the Fram Strait from around 17 Ma.\nTo summarize:\n- A circulation system similar to the present was probably established in the southern Norwegian – Greenland Sea before the Fram Strait became a deep-water gateway and before the establishments of the major ice sheets in this area (the first occurred in SE Greenland from ~7 Ma).\n- Uncertainties still relates to the timing of the development of ocean circulation in the northern Norwegian – Greenland Sea including the Fram Strait gateway where drift onset has been estimated to at least 11 Ma.\n- The onset of drift growth at 1.3 Ma slightly south of the Fram Strait occurred after the onset of deep-water circulation through the Fram Strait and it is inferred to be related to the glacial expansion recorded in the area.",

            "abstract": "226Ra excesses in mafic arc magmas are generally attributed to recent (< 8 kyr) addition of slab-fluid to the mantle wedge and/or mantle melting. Preservation of 226Ra-230Th disequilibria from such sources requires short crustal residence times (<< 8 kyr) for these magmas. The correlation between 226Ra excesses and 10Be/Be previously observed for magmas from the Chilean Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) contributed to the view that recent slab-fluid additions causes 226Ra excesses in arc magmas1. Our extensive dataset for Llaima and Lonquimay volcanoes (SVZ) shows variations in (226Ra/230Th) for each volcano, and in some cases within single eruptions. These variations span almost the entire SVZ range and question the pertinence of mantle-derived 226Ra-230Th disequilibria models.\nLlaima and Lonquimay volcanoes differ in terms of their petrology and magmatic evolution. Llaima magmas (51 to 55 wt% SiO2) are predominantly crystal-rich and carry conspicuous evidence for magma mixing and AFC processes. 238U and 231Pa excesses and incompatible trace element ratios are correlated and this can be accounted for by up to 20% assimilation of basement plutonic rocks2. Crustal contamination had a secondary influence on 226Ra-230Th disequilibria. Magmas with the highest AFC contribution have 226Ra-230Th close to equilibrium, implying that (226Ra-230Th) are mostly affected by either differentiation on time scales of ~8 kyr, or more likely, mixing with mush bodies several kyr old.\nLonquimay magmas (52 to 64 wt% SiO2) are almost aphyric. Their evolution was controlled by fractional crystallization with limited crustal contamination. (226Ra-230Th) range from moderate 226Ra excesses to small deficits, and are negatively correlated with Ba/Th and MgO. These observations are difficult to reconcile with only slab-fluid addition and mantle melting. We posit that this (226Ra-230Th) range results from diffusive Ra-exchange between young recharge melts and an old crystal mush. A similar process may also explain 226Ra deficits at some other SVZ volcanoes. Thus (226Ra-230Th) in erupted magmas reflect modification of mantle-derived signatures by open-system magmatic processes in the crust.\n1Sigmarsson et al., 2002, Earth and Planet. Sc.

In total, 54 sampling sites were distributed along three moraines representing surfaces exposed for 8, 65 and 120 years. For comparison, soil samples were collected from nearby birch woodlands, representing soils in a mature ecosystem likely to establish on the moraines in the future.\nThe youngest moraines were sparsely vegetated with only 10% cover of mosses and grasses. The plant cover increased to 67% after 120 years, and was characterized by mosses (38%), dwarf shrubs (20%) and low growing birch (3.5%). Consequently, the soil formed over 120 years contained 1.1 kg C m-2 in the surface layer (0-10 cm), or about one third of the 3.2 kg C m-2 in soil under the woodlands. The N stock was estimated at 0.06 kg N m-2after 120 yrs, almost one fourth of that under the woodlands. The data suggest that landscape affects vegetation establishment and in turn, both landscape and vegetation affect soil development. Thus, concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), N and noncrystalline oxalate extractable Al and Fe were higher within depressions than on ridges and slopes.\nThe comparison of SOC stock in the moraine-derived soils with that under the birch woodlands showed that the young proglacial soils still have a large potential to accrete SOC within the developing pedosphere. With the observed accrual rate of 9.1 g C m-2 yr-1in the top 10 cm, it may take the moraine soils an additional 220 yrs to accrue SOC stocks comparable with those under the birch forest. Given the fact that all Icelandic glaciers are receding, assessing SOC sequestration in new soil formation may be important to off-setting some of anthropogenic emissions.\nThe research is funded by the University of Iceland Doctoral Fund, the University of Iceland Trust Fund, the Landsvirkjun‘s Energy Research Fund, the Friends of Vatnajökull Fund, the Icelandic Research Fund (no. 120211021) and Targeted Investment in Excellence, Climate, Water and Carbon Project, C-MASC, OSU, USA.\nKeywords: Soil organic carbon, nitrogen, soil development, chronosequence, plant colonization, vegetation succession, glacier forefield, Skaftafellsjökull, Iceland.",

Presently, innovative data acquisition systems for the oceans are underway and they will allow future imaging of the \"inaccessible\" parts of the Earth.\n(2) In the 1980s seismological data centers were set up to facilitate data archiving and distribution. Since then, open data exchange (not a matter of course) and easy data retrieval have become standard. The impact of this has been phenomenal: most observational studies efficiently retrieve data from these main seismological data centers and the archived seismograms are used for various types of studies, carried out by different persons and groups.\n(3) Seismic tomography changed the face of seismological research. From travel time to waveform tomography, from ray theory to finite frequency tomography: new and improved tomographic techniques greatly enhanced our images (and understanding) of the Earth's interior.\n(4) Many of these developments would not have been possible without young, motivated, seismologists that were educated and stimulated by insightful supervisors.\nOne person has had a major impact on all these fields.

Among these and other candidates for measuring vegetation heights, InSAR has the advantage of achieving wide coverage areas (on the order of 100 km in cross-track swath) over short time periods, thus making it practical for large-scale assessments of the global environment.\nThe determination of forest stand height (FSH), which is an assessment made on the order of one to ten hectares of resolution, InSAR can provide measures that are proportional to FSH. These are: 1.) interferometric phase compared to a known DEM, preferably of the bald earth, 2.) interferometric correlation (polarimetric or otherwise), which is related to the volume scattering nature of the target, and 3.) interferometric correlation which is related to the temporal decorrelation of the target. Of these, while the volumetric aspect of interferometric correlation is of keen interest, because of the dominant error source of temporal decorrelation, it comes at the cost of the need to perform single-pass interferometry. While such satellite systems do exist (notably the TanDEM-X mission), for vegetation applications, lower frequency systems such as ALOS-1 and -2, and the future NASA radar mission at L-band, provides better signal returns from throughout the vegetation canopy. Hence, rather than relying on volumetric correlation to provide the desired FSH signature, repeat-pass observations of temporal decorrelation are coupled with a vegetation model for this decorrelation to determine the vegetation height.\nIn order to demonstrate this technique, the University of Massachusetts has used 46-day repeat-pass ALOS data to estimate FSH over the US State of Maine, nearly a 10 million hectare region. The results have been validated using the LVIS lidar system and a map of vegetation height provided by Woods Hole Research Center. This talk will describe the process that was used for creating this map, and how the data processing was automated to account for differences in temporal decorrelation over this large study area.",

            "abstract": "Ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O is thought to be the second most abundant mineral in Earth’s lower mantle. Due to its potentially weak rheological behavior it may play a key role in controlling rheology of the lower mantle and in generating seismic anisotropy [1]. At pressures between approximately 40 GPa and 70 GPa at 300 K, the ferrous iron in ferropericlase undergoes a spin crossover from high-spin to low-spin state [2]. Our understanding of the deformation behavior of both high- and low-spin ferropericlase is incomplete, particularly at high-temperatures. The only published deformation study on (Mg,Fe)O through the spin transition pressure region has limited pressure resolution and was measured at 300 K [3].\nHere, we present new results from synchrotron radial x-ray diffraction measurements on the deformation behavior of (Mg,Fe)O at high-pressures, covering the spin crossover pressure range, and high-temperatures. One set of experiments was performed on (Mg0.8-0.9Fe0.1-0.2)O at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) up to 96 GPa at 300 K. A second suite of data were collected at the Extreme Conditions Beamline of PETRA III (DESY), where (Mg0.8Fe0.2)O was compressed at constant temperature to 70 GPa (at 850 K) and 40 GPa (at 1150 K). In all experiments, pressure was remotely increased using a gas membrane system, which allows for obtaining a very fine pressure resolution.\nFrom our data, we calculate the yield strength of ferropericlase, which we find to increase by a factor of about three throughout the lower mantle. Furthermore, we infer likely slip system activities of ferropericlase in Earth’s lower mantle based on our experimental data and elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) modelling. We will discuss the effect of the increase of ferropericlase strength on the fate of subducting slabs and we will show potential implications for seismic anisotropy observations in D``, where low-spin ferropericlase is characterized by very large elastic anisotropy [4].\n1.

We examine September to November 2006 over the tropics. El Nino-induced dry conditions over western Indonesia led to extensive biomass burning and persistent CO greater than 200 ppb in the upper troposphere. This was one of the highest CO episodes over the MLS period since 2004. We show how improvements in the vertical resolution of trace gas retrievals can help to distinguish between errors in parameterized vertical transport and biases in bottom-up emissions estimates.\nWe simulate the episode using the NASA GISS ModelE2 coupled composition-climate model with different subgrid physics for small ensembles of experiments with perturbed initial conditions. The starting point is the CMIP5 version of the model, in which there was a pronounced vertical CO dipole over the Maritime Continent, but with a CO peak 100 ppb higher than Aura CO in the upper troposphere. With modified cumulus and boundary layer parameterizations, but the same prescribed biomass burning emissions estimates, the upper tropospheric CO bias is significantly reduced. Concurrently, precipitation over the emissions source region is reduced relative to observational estimates, leading to better consistency with the dry conditions under which the burning occurred. We discuss the effects of the physics changes on the roles of convective frequency and depth in reducing the bias.",

            "abstract": "Arsenic is a ubiquitous element in soils worldwide and has the potential to negatively impact human and ecosystem health under certain biogeochemical conditions. While arsenic is relatively immobile in most oxidized soils due to a high affinity for soil solids, arsenic becomes mobilized under reduced soil conditions due to the reductive dissolution of iron(III) oxides thereby releasing soil-bound arsenic. Since arsenic is a well-known carcinogen, this plant-soil process has the potential to negatively impact the lives of billions of rice consumers worldwide upon plant uptake and grain storage of released arsenic. Moreover, arsenic uptake by rice is excacerbated by the use of As-laden groundwater for rice irrigation.\nOne proposed strategy to decrease arsenic uptake by rice plants is via an increase in dissolved silicon in paddy soil solution (pore-water), since silicic acid and arsenous acid share an uptake pathway. However, several soil processes that influence arsenic cycling may be affected by silicon including desorption from bulk soil, formation and mineralogy of iron(III) oxide plaque, and adsorption/desorption onto/from iron plaque; the effect of silicon on these soil processes will ultimately dictate the effectiveness of altered dissolved silicon in decreasing arsenic uptake at the root, which in turn dictates the concentration of arsenic found in grains. Furthermore, the source of silicon may impact carbon cycling and, in particular, methane emissions.\nHere, impacts of altered dissolved silicon on processes that affect rhizospheric biogeochemical cycling of arsenic and subsequent plant-uptake, and how it influences other biogeochemical cycles such as carbon and iron are investigated. We show that silicon can decrease arsenic uptake and grain storage under certain conditions, and that altered silicon affects the type of iron (III) oxide that comprises iron plaque.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism of the reconnection onset in planetary magnetotails has been a topic of hot debate for more than three decades. At the kinetic level of description the key problem is a seemingly universal stability of the collisionless tearing mode when electrons are magnetized by the magnetic field normal to the current sheet. This effect can be eliminated in 2D equilibria with magnetic flux accumulated at the anti-sunward end of the tail. However, the resulting instability seen in 2D PIC simulations with open boundaries differs from the classical tearing mode because its main effect is the formation of dipolarization fronts, i. e., regions of an enhanced normal magnetic field rather than the reversal of its sign. Strong tailward gradients of the normal magnetic field characteristic of fronts suggest that they can be destroyed in 3D by buoyancy and flapping instabilities. However, 3D PIC simulations show that buoyancy and flapping motions can neither destroy nor change critically the near-2D picture of the front evolution, although they do significantly disturb it. Modeling and understanding of this kinetic picture of the reconnection onset in MHD terms is critically important for incorporating the explosive reconnection physics into global models of the magnetosphere and solar corona. A key to this has become the recognition that tail current sheets with accumulated flux regions can also be unstable with respect to an ideal analog of the tearing mode, which has a similar structure of the electromagnetic field and plasma perturbations but preserves the original magnetic field topology. MHD simulations with high Lundquist number confirm the existence of such “pseudo-tearing” instability regimes. Non-MHD effects, including different motions of electron and ion species as well as the ion Landau dissipation transform these ideal MHD motions into the tearing/slippage instability obtained in PIC simulations.",

            "abstract": "Salinity intrusion is a major climate and human induced hazard in coastal deltaic regions resulting in substantial adverse effects on crop production. Impacts are exacerbated by intensified cyclones, sea level rise and storm surges. In this regard, many farmers in the populous Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta of Bangladesh have adopted saline shrimp (Bagda) farming with associated displacement of tenant farmers and potential long term damage to the soil through chemicals used to enhance shrimp production. Despite the impact of salinity intrusion on the environment and the commonly perceived effects of shrimp farming on poverty, there has not been any systematic study that examines the associative relationships between salinisation, shrimp farming and poverty in this delta region. Using the 2011 Bangladesh Population and Housing Census and 2010 LandSat remote sensing data this study examines the spatially explicit impact of salinization as well as saline and freshwater shrimp farming on poverty in the Delta, accounting for important environmental and socio-economic predictors. The findings shows that after accounting for important environmental and socioeconomic predictors, levels and intensities of salinization as well as the extent of saline and freshwater shrimp farming in a union are significantly associated with poverty. The results of the study demonstrate that increases in levels and intensities of salinity increases the probability of a union being in the poorest quintile. As such saline water shrimp farming has the potential to reduce poverty only at high intensities, whilst low levels of freshwater shrimp farming are associated with a reduction in poverty.",

            "abstract": "Subduction interfaces that produce great earthquakes are often said to be “strongly coupled”, and those that creep are said to be “weakly coupled”. However, the relation between the strength and seismogenic behavior of subduction faults is far from clear. Seismological and geodetic observations of earthquake rupture usually provide information only on stress change, not fault strength. In this study, we infer fault strength by calculating frictional heating along megathrusts and comparing results with heat flow measurements. We find that stick-slip megathrusts that have produced great earthquakes such as at Japan Trench and northern Sumatra have very low apparent friction coefficients (~ 0.02 – 0.03), but megathrusts that creep such as at Northern Hikurangi and Manila Trench have higher values (up to ~0.13). The differnce cannot be explained by coseismic dynamic weakening of the stick-slip megathrusts, because the average stress drop in great earthquakes is usually less than 5 MPa, equivalent to a coseismic reduction of apparent friction coefficient by less than ~0.01. Therefore our results indicate differences in the static strength of different subduction faults. Why are the creeping faults stronger? We think it is related to their creeping mechanism. Very rugged subducting seafloor tends to cause creep and hinder great earthquake rupture (Wang and Bilek, 2014). In contrast, all giant earthquakes have occurred at subduction zones with relatively smooth subducting seafloor. Large geometrical irregularities such as seamounts generate heterogeneous structure and stresses that promote numerous small and medium size earthquakes and aseismic creep. The creeping is a process of breaking and wearing of geometrical irregularities in a deformation zone and is expected to be against relatively large resistance (strong creep). This is different from the creeping of smooth faults due to the presence of weak fault gouge (weak creep) such as along the creeping segment of the San Andreas fault. The general correlation between subducting seafloor ruggedness, creeping, and greater heat dissipation, if further verified, provides a new perspective in assessing earthquake and tsunami hazards for risk mitigation.\nWang, K., and S.

            "abstract": "Weather-based index insurance projects are rapidly expanding across the developing world. Many of these projects use satellite-based observations to detect extreme weather events, which inform and trigger payouts to smallholder farmers. While most index insurance programs use precipitation measurements to determine payouts, the use of remotely sensed observations of vegetation is currently being explored. In order to use vegetation indices as a basis for payouts, it is necessary to establish a consistent relationship between the vegetation index and the health and abundance of agriculture on the ground. The accuracy with which remotely sensed vegetation indices can detect changes in agriculture depends on both the spatial scale of the agriculture and the spatial resolution of the sensor. This study analyzes the relationship between meter and decameter scale vegetation fraction estimates derived from linear spectral mixture models with a more commonly used vegetation index (NDVI, EVI) at hectometer spatial scales. In addition, the analysis incorporates land cover/land use field observations collected in Tigray Ethiopia in July 2013. . It also tests the flexibility and utility of a standardized spectral mixture model in which land cover is represented as continuous fields of rock and soil substrate (S), vegetation (V) and dark surfaces (D; water, shadow). This analysis found strong linear relationships with vegetation metrics at 1.6-meter, 30-meter and 250-meter resolutions across spectrally diverse subsets of Tigray, Ethiopia and significantly correlated relationships using the Spearman’s rho statistic. The observed linear scaling has positive implications for future use of moderate resolution vegetation indices in similar landscapes; especially index insurance projects that are scaling up across the developing world using remotely-sensed environmental information.",

This technique allows for the real-time, speciated measurement of OA composition, yielding molecular information that is highly complementary to ensemble data from electron-impact ionization. OA composition is measured with both ionization schemes as a function of oxidant exposure within a flow reactor, providing detailed information on the kinetics and products of heterogeneous oxidation over multiple generations of oxidation.

            "abstract": "To enact effective policies to address climate change, decision makers need both scientific and political support. One major barrier to U.S. climate policy enactment has been the opposition of private sector actors to proposed policies and to climate science itself. Increasingly, the public and investors are holding companies accountable for their actions around climate change—including political activies, affiliations with trade groups, and involvement with climate science. However, this accountability is inhibited by the prominent role that trade associations have played in climate policy debates in recent years. The opaque nature of such groups is problematic, as it inhibits the public from understanding who is obstructing progress on addressing climate change, and in some cases, impedes the public’s climate literacy. Voluntary climate reporting can yield some information on companies’ climate engagement and demonstrates the need for greater transparency in corporate political activities around climate change. We analyze CDP climate reporting data from 1,824 companies to assess the degree to which corporate actors disclosed their political influence on climate policies through their trade associations. Results demonstrate the limitations of voluntary reporting and the extent to which companies utilize their trade associations to influence climate change policy debates without being held accountable for these positions. Notably, many companies failed to acknowledge their board seat on trade groups with significant climate policy engagement. Of those that did acknowledge their board membership, some claimed not to agree with their trade associations’ positions on climate change. These results raise questions about who trade groups are representing when they challenge the science or obstruct policies to address climate change. Recommendations for overcoming this barrier to informed decision making to address climate change will be discussed.",

These observations provide a solid foundation for understanding tropical convection. In this presentation, using 16+ years of TRMM data, first, various types of convective systems in the tropics and subtropics are summarized based on their sizes, depths and convective intensities. Their contributions to the total precipitation and latent heating over land and ocean are budgeted at different temporal, e.g. diurnal, MJO, seasonal, and inter-annual and spatial scales. The spectrums of precipitation and latent heating contributions demonstrate the importance of organized convective systems in the tropics and subtropics. Last, a preliminary analysis of the large-scale environments favoring organized convective systems is briefly shown.",

            "abstract": "Disparate in situ and remote sensing time series data are being collected to understand the structure and function of ecosystems and how they may be affected by climate change. However, resource and logistical constraints limit the frequency and extent of observations, particularly in the harsh environments of the arctic and the tropics, necessitating the development of a systematic sampling strategy to maximize coverage and objectively represent variability at desired scales. These regions host large areas of potentially vulnerable ecosystems that are poorly represented in Earth system models (ESMs), motivating two new field campaigns, called Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) for the Arctic and Tropics, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MSTC) provides a quantitative methodology for stratifying sampling domains, informing site selection, and determining the representativeness of measurement sites and networks. We applied MSTC to down-scaled general circulation model results and data for the State of Alaska at a 4 km2 resolution to define maps of ecoregions for the present (2000–2009) and future (2090–2099), showing how combinations of 37 bioclimatic characteristics are distributed and how they may shift in the future. Optimal representative sampling locations were identified on present and future ecoregion maps, and representativeness maps for candidate sampling locations were produced. We also applied MSTC to remotely sensed LiDAR measurements and multi-spectral imagery from the WorldView-2 satellite at a resolution of about 5 m2 within the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) in Alaska. At this resolution, polygonal ground features—such as centers, edges, rims, and troughs—can be distinguished. Using these remote sensing data, we up-scaled vegetation distribution data collected on these polygonal ground features to a large area of the BEO to provide distributions of plant functional types that can be used to parameterize ESMs. In addition, we applied MSTC to 4 km2 global bioclimate data to define global ecoregions and understand the representativeness of CTFS-ForestGEO, Fluxnet, and RAINFOR sampling networks. These maps identify tropical forests underrepresented in existing observations of individual and combined networks.",

            "abstract": "Grassroots research networks, such as AmeriFlux, require data and metadata integration from multiple, independently managed field sites, scales, and science domains. The goal of these networks is production of consistent datasets enabling investigation of broad science questions at regional and global scales. These datasets combine data from a large number of data providers, who often utilize different data collection protocols and data processing approaches. In this scenario, data integration and curation quickly become large-scale efforts. This presentation reports on our experience with integration efforts for the AmeriFlux network. In AmeriFlux we are attempting to integrate flux, meteorological, biological, soil, chemistry, and disturbance data and metadata. Our data management activities range from acquisition/publication mechanisms, quality control, processing and product generation, data and software synchronized versioning and archiving, and interaction mechanisms and tools for data providers and data users. To enable consistent data processing and network-level data quality, combinations of automated and visual data quality assessment procedures were built, extending on checks already done at site levels. The implementation of community developed and trusted algorithms to operate in production mode proved to be a key aspect of data product generation, with extensive testing and validation being one of the main concerns. Clear definitions for data processing levels help with easily tracking different data products and data quality levels. For metadata and ancillary information, formatting standards are even more relevant, since variables collected are considerably more heterogeneous. Documentation and training on the standards were crucial in this case, with instruction sessions having proved to be an effective approach, given that documentation cannot cover all different scenarios at different sites. This work is being developed in close coordination with ICOS in Europe and other regional networks aiming at regular and harmonized releases of data and metadata products for the FLUXNET network of flux monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "We conducted an assessment of changes in permafrost area and carbon storage simulated by process-based models between 1960 and 2300. The models participating in this comparison were those that had joined the model integration team of the Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon Research Coordination Network (see\nhttp://www.biology.ufl.edu/permafrostcarbon/\n). Each of the models in this comparison conducted simulations over the permafrost land region in the Northern Hemisphere driven by CCSM4-simulated climate for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Among the models, the area of permafrost (defined as the area for which active layer thickness was less than 3 m) ranged between 13.2 and 20.0 million km2. Between 1960 and 2300, models indicated the loss of permafrost area between 5.1 to 6.0 million km2 for RCP 4.5 and between 7.1 and 15.2 million km2 for RCP 8.5. Among the models, the density of soil carbon storage in 1960 ranged between 13 and 42 thousand g C m-2; models that explicitly represented carbon with depth had estimates greater than 27 thousand g C m-2. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, changes in soil carbon between 1960 and 2300 ranged between losses of 32 Pg C to gains of 58 Pg C, in which models that explicitly represent soil carbon with depth simulated losses or lower gains of soil carbon in comparison with those that did not. For the RCP 8.5 scenario, changes in soil carbon between 1960 and 2300 ranged between losses of 642 Pg C to gains of 66 Pg C, in which those models that represent soil carbon explicitly with depth all simulated losses, while those that do not all simulated gains. These results indicate that there are substantial differences in responses of carbon dynamics between model that do and do not explicitly represent soil carbon with depth in the permafrost region. We present analyses of the implications of the differences for atmospheric carbon dynamics at multiple temporal scales between 1960 and 2300.",

            "abstract": "Today, a monitoring network measures atmospheric CO2 at high temporal and spatial resolution. Atmospheric transport models then calculate regional CO2 source and sink fluxes. Prior to this instrumental period, archived air, firn air, and air trapped in polar ice are the only direct atmospheric archives to reconstruct past CO2 changes. Only ice from Antarctica allows reliable CO2 measurements, either from classical ice cores or outcropping ice, while Greenland records are subject to in situ production. They provide high-resolution and high-precision CO2 reconstructions up to 800,000 years back in time. Ice core records have revealed an intimate connection between CO2 variations and major changes in Earth’s climate and have fundamentally shaped the community’s view of the global carbon cycle. Knowing the concentration of past atmospheric CO2 and the other greenhouse gases is key to provide the radiative forcing for climate simulations. Ice core reconstructions broadly fulfilled this task. On the contrary, we are far from a coherent understanding of the mechanisms driving these changes. Analyzing phase relations between CO2, other ice-core derived species, and proxies from marine sediment cores allow for the identification of factors likely responsible for the observed CO2 changes. Specifically, the strength of the Atlantic overturning circulation and Southern Ocean upwelling are thought to be key players. However, the observed CO2 changes cannot uniquely be related to a specific process. Here, stable carbon isotope analysis on CO2 extracted from ice provides additional constraints as any process leads to isotope fractionation of the reservoir. Analytical progress during the last decade affords us with a growing data set on this long-awaited parameter. This presentation provides a state-of-the-art overview on ice-based CO2 and its carbon isotopic signature focusing both on the long-term orbital changes as well as rapid changes documented during the last deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "While the term “litter quality” is vague and can always be associated to a specific litter property (e.g., C:N, %lignin, decay rate), and thus should be replaced with the term that describes that property (e.g., stoichiometry, C-chemistry, recalcitrance), we defend the use of the term “recalcitrance” to describe the potential decomposability of litter, or its components. Recalcitrance can be quantified in laboratory incubations, by measuring the rate of production of CO2 from litter, under optimal environmental conditions. “Recalcitrance” is an inherent relative attribute of litter resulting from the synergistic interactions of several specific physic-chemical properties (e.g., stoichiometry, chemistry, energetic, physical structure) of that litter which in absence of environmental constraints (i.e., microbial limitation, physical aggregation, mineral-bonding) determine its potential rate of CO2 production. Because these environmental constraints often cannot be excluded in studies of soil organic matter (SOM), the term “recalcitrance” is not appropriate for SOM, and “persistence” is preferred. Recalcitrance is, of course, relative and requests a time scale of reference, since any litter eventually decomposes. We will illustrate this rational with examples from our latest laboratory incubations using: 1) a variety of plant litter types, 2) litter with differential isotopic enrichment of the metabolic and structural components, 3) soils containing isotopic enriched litter-derived organic matter.",

As part of it, the Multi-Viewing Multi-Channel Multi-Polarization Imaging mission (3MI) will be dedicated to the operational monitoring of aerosols but will also provide unique observations for characterization of cloud properties building on the legacy of POLDER and particularly of its 3rd mission (PARASOL) within the A-Train. Through the synergy of POLDER3/PARASOL and MODIS/AQUA several studies have demonstrated the great interest of combining multispectral, multiangle and polarization measurements in the visible, near and shortwave infrared to better constrain retrieval of clouds microphysical and macrophysical properties. Remote-sensing of cloud thermodynamic phase (Riedi et al, 2010), liquid (Bréon and Doutriaux-Boucher, 2005) or ice clouds microphysics (Zhang et al, 2009; Cole et al, 2012), cloud radiative (Zeng et al, 2012) or macrophysical properties (Ferlay et al, 2010; Desmons et al, 2013) can unarguably benefit from the additional information content brought by polarization and multiangle measurements. At the same time, retrieval algorithms are gaining further complexity and skills. Thanks to availability of computational resources, practical implementation of optimal estimation or related optimization techniques (Delanoe & Hogan, 2008; Dubovik et al, 2013) have appeared that allow simultaneous and consistent retrieval of larger sets of parameters from constantly growing observations vectors. Therefore 3MI observations will not only allow to improve accuracy of future cloud products but also opens perspectives for the development of new retrieval algorithms. A major challenge for cloud remote-sensing from passive measurements is to obtain information on clouds properties vertical distribution and structure. Through results of a comprehensive information content analysis we will illustrate our current efforts to obtain vertically resolved information on cloud properties from 3MI passive measurements only. In particular the synergy of multiangle polarization measurements at 443 and 865 nm with Oxygen A-band differential absorption information to retrieve cloud geometrical thickness will be discussed.",

Satellite dust retrievals with sub-daily resolution such as from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) and METOP A/B Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments are used to identify dust source regions. Identified dust source regions are then linked to soil properties and land type classification data sets. Information on the mineralogical composition of transported dust inferred from IASI observation are used (a) to investigate the impact of different source geomorphologies and thus different radiative properties of airborne dust particles, and (b) to estimate the contribution of dust uplift from alluvial sediments compared to dust emission from non-hydrological sources. Ultimately, this study contributes to the understanding of controlling mechanism on the interannual variability of dust source activation and will improve current dust emission modules coupled to atmosphere models.",

Indeed, poor model representation of tropical forest carbon cycling and response to change (due in part to a paucity of data) is the most significant source of terrestrial uncertainty in projections of Earth’s future climate. Here we provide an ecological perspective on aspects of tropical forest structure and function that will present distinctive challenges to the Earth System Modeling community. Specifically, we will discuss: (1) high diversity of species, climate, soil types, and land use history within and among tropical forests and how this diversity influences forest responses to perturbation; (2) nutrient regulation of tropical carbon cycling responses to global change, including limitation by phosphorus; and (3) a lack of physiological data specific for tropical plant and microbial communities (e.g., photosynthetic optima, soil microbial carbon use efficiencies). With the goal of determining which processes and/or measurements should be better constrained in order to improve the capacity to model the tropics, we will examine a set of relevant Earth System Model parameters in the context of data synthesized from the literature and of new tropical forest physiological measurements we have recently made. The objective of this talk is not to discourage modelers from attempting to model the tropics, but rather to support this important work by offering research directions likely to reduce uncertainty in future predictions of Earth System Models.",

            "abstract": "The combined effects of tectonic and climatic forcing govern the evolution of landscapes, modifying erosional processes, changing river profiles, and ultimately impacting depositional systems. The complexity of the response, however, often means that we cannot predict a priori how a given landscape will react to climatic changes.\nThe Del Medio catchment is located in the Humahuaca Basin, an intermontane valley of the Eastern Cordillera. This area coincides with a climatic divide between a sub-humid and a semi-arid environment. An extensive debris-flow fan sourced in the Del Medio catchment covers ca. 18.6 km2 of the lower basin. To investigate rates and timing of its evolution, we analyzed cosmogenic 10Be concentrations on large boulders from the fan surface, river sands and pebbles in 3 active channels, a depth profile, and bedrock exposed atop the drainage basin margins. Our CRN results illustrate the rapid rate at which the fan surface is subject to change, with each of the 16 analyzed boulder samples providing ages of < 400 years. The 15-m deep depth profile exposes three cycles of activity in the recent past. In addition, river sands record very high denudation rates (from several mm/yr to tens of mm/yr), despite bedrock denudation rates of < 0.04 mm/yr from most bedrock ridges. Interestingly, modern pebbles from tributaries with recent landslide activity consistently yield denudation rates that are faster than those from sands, while tributaries without landslide activity show the opposite pattern, documenting the importance of grain-size dependency for inferring the main mechanism of sediment transport within a catchment.\nFarther upstream in the more arid Humahuaca Basin, abandoned fluvial terrace sequences have been linked to wetter episodes during the late Quaternary. Within those fills, preliminary paleo-denudation rates reach values similar to those currently observed in the Del Medio catchment, while modern denudation rates from river sands are similar to the low rates observed from bedrock ridges. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Del Medio fan could be a modern analog of those older fill sequences, providing a unique opportunity to link present-day processes to those that were likely active in the past during wetter climate episodes.",

            "abstract": "Seismically determined S-wave velocities in the Earth’s inner core are observed to be much lower (10-30%) than those generally inferred from mineral physics. This is a remarkably large discrepancy - mineralogical models for the mantle and the outer core match the observed velocities to around 1%. In no other large volume of the Earth does such a difference exist. There have been a number of arguments put forward over the years to account for the difference, but none have been universally accepted and our inability to explain the seismic velocities of the inner core remains an uncomfortable truth.\nHere, we present results from ab initio molecular dynamics calculations performed at 360 GPa and core temperatures on hcp and fcc iron, and on fcc-Fe alloyed with nickel and hcp-Fe alloyed with silicon. The calculated shear modulus, and therefore seismic velocities, of pure hcp-Fe reduces dramatically just prior to melting, providing an elegant explanation for the observed velocities. Calculations on fcc-Fe show no such strong reduction in VS, with a transformation to an hcp-type structure prior to melting; addition of 6.5 atm% and 13 atm% Ni to fcc-Fe raises the temperature of this transition.\nWhen silicon is added to hcp-Fe, the pre-melting behaviour is found to be very similar to that of pure hcp-Fe with a strong nonlinear shear weakening just before melting and a corresponding reduction in VS. Because temperatures range from T/Tm = 1 at the inner-outer core boundary to T/Tm ≈ 0.99 at the centre, this strong nonlinear effect on VS should occur in the inner core, providing a compelling explanation for the low VS observed.",

Ground based and airborne measurements were taken in remote desert regions of Mali, Mauritania and Algeria. This presentation will show new in-situ aircraft measurements of Saharan dust from the 2011 flights, with size distributions extending to 300 μm, representing measurements extending further into the coarse mode than previously published for airborne Saharan dust. A significant coarse mode was present in the size distribution measurements with effective diameter from 2.3 to 19.4 μm and coarse mode volume median diameter from 5.8 to 45.3 μm. The mean size distribution had a larger relative proportion of coarse mode particles than previous aircraft measurements with significant contribution from the ‘giant mode’ – particles larger than 38 microns.\nProperties of dust size distribution and optical properties will be presented in relation to dust age since uplift, dust event type and altitude. Vertical distributions of dust over desert (for both fresh and aged dust events) and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean from 42 aircraft profiles will be presented, demonstrating how size distributions and optical properties change during the early stages of the dust lifecycle. Size distributions show a loss of 60 to 90% of particles larger than 30 microns 12 h after uplift. Single scattering albedo increases from 0.92 to 0.94 to 0.95 between fresh, aged, and Eastern Atlantic dust profiles. Finally the impact of transport and changing optical properties on the radiative effect of dust will be examined.",

            "abstract": "Global surface temperature plays a significant role in the public perception of climate change. However, observations are not uniformly distributed over the surface of the planet. The lack of data for the rapidly warming Arctic in the Met Office HadCRUT4 dataset has led to a systematic underestimation of the rate of warming over the past decade and a half. Smaller biases have also been detected in other versions of the temperature record.\nThis underestimation of recent temperature trends is one contributory factor (of several) to the apparent 'hiatus' in global warming. The use of the putative hiatus as an argument against action on global warming has created a social context in which what should have been a minor technical paper appeared to take on a much greater significance. From a scientific perspective, the apparent hiatus is irrelevant to our understanding of long term greenhouse warming, and should therefore have no bearing on policy. However the misinformation context into which science is communicated means that any scientific work can take on a policy significance which is determined not by the work itself, but by the societal context.\nThis raises challenging ethical questions for scientists. In an information environment in which interested parties have already attached policy implications to many aspects of climate science, it becomes impossible to publish or communicate a scientific work without implicitly taking a position. Different segments of the public have different and often contradictory perceptions of the scientific context, and as a result the words of the scientist may convey completely different messages to different hearers. Communicating science in a way which does not mislead is difficult, however abandoning the effort at communication can lead to the public being more misled.",

            "abstract": "Rockfalls, debris flows and rock avalanches represent a major natural hazard for the population in mountainous, volcanic and coastal areas but their direct observation on the field is very difficult. Recent field studies showed that gravitational instabilities can be detected, localized and characterized thanks to the seismic signal they generate. Therefore, a burning challenge for risks assessment related to these events is to obtain quantiative informations on the characteristics of the rockfalls (mass, speed, extension,...) from the properties of the signal (seismic energy, frequencies,...).\nUsing a theoretical model of viscoelastic impact of a sphere on a plane, we develop analytical scaling laws relating the energy radiated in elastic waves, the energy dissipated in viscoelasticity during the impact and the frequencies of the generated acoustic signal to the mass m and the impact speed Vz of the sphere and to the elastic parameters of the involved materials. The elastic energy is shown to vary as m5/3Vz11/5 on plates and as mVz13/5 on blocks, regardless of the elastic parameters. The energy dissipated in viscoelasticity does not depend on the support thickness and varies as m2/3Vz11/5. The mean frequency of the generated signal is inversely proportional to the impact duration.\nThen, we conduct simple laboratory experiments that consist in dropping spherical beads of different size and materials and small gravels on thin plates of glass and Plexiglass and rock blocks. The elastic energy emitted by an impact on the supports is first quantitatively estimated and compared to the potential energy of fall and to the potential energy change during the shock. We observe a quantitative agreement between experimental data and the analytical scaling laws, even when we use small gravels instead of spherical beads as impactors. These experiments allows to valid the theoretical model and to establish the energy budget of an impact. In the experiments, piezoelectric accelerometers are used to record the signals in a wide frequency range: 1 Hz to 56 kHz. The experiments are also monitored optically using fast cameras.",

            "abstract": "The modeling of malaria vector mosquito populations yields great insight into drivers of malaria transmission at the village scale. Simulation of individual mosquitoes as “agents” in a distributed, dynamic model domain may be greatly beneficial for simulation of spatial relationships of vectors and hosts. In this study, an agent-based model is used to simulate the life cycle and movement of individual malaria vector mosquitoes in a Niger Sahel village, with individual simulated mosquitoes interacting with their physical environment as well as humans. Various processes that are known to be epidemiologically important, such as the dependence of parity on flight distance between hydrologically-controlled developmental habitat and blood meal hosts and therefore spatial relationships of standing water and houses, are readily simulated using this modeling paradigm. Impacts of perturbations can be evaluated on the basis of vectorial capacity, because the interactions between individuals that make up the population- scale metric vectorial capacity can be easily tracked for simulated mosquitoes and human blood meal hosts, without the need to estimate vectorial capacity parameters.\nAs expected, model results show pronounced impacts of pool source reduction from larvicide application and draining, but with varying degrees of impact depending on the spatial relationship between pools and human habitation. Results highlight the importance of spatially-explicit simulation that can model individuals such as in an agent-based model.The impacts of perturbations on village scale malaria transmission depend on spatial locations of individual mosquitoes, as well as the tracking of relevant life cycle events and characteristics of individual mosquitoes. This study demonstrates advantages of using an agent-based approach for village-scale mosquito simulation to address questions in which spatial relationships are known to be important.",

Experimental and computational results consistently show a significantly lower water storage capacity in MgSiO3 perovskite, the dominant mineral of the Earth’s lower mantle. This disparity in water solubility predicts widespread melting at the base of the transition zone in mantle downwellings or some other process to create a transition zone “water filter.”\nWe present the results of ab-initio calculations on the hydrogen incorporation in ringwoodite, majorite, ilmenite, calcium silicate perovskite, and magnesium silicate perovskite. We demonstrate a multiplicity of OH defect mechanisms at the base of the transition zone, including vacancies on the Mg and Si sites, as well as coupled substitutions with aluminum. We calculate the partitioning of water between each phase. While the partitioning of water between ringwoodite and MgSiO3 is >100, we find that partitioning of water between CaSiO3-perovskite and ringwoodite exceeds unity under the conditions of cold downwellings at the base of the transition zone, suggesting that a significant fraction of the water can be stored in minor phases of the lower mantle instead of requiring a filter at the base of the transition zone. This finding significantly relaxes the constraints on the Earth’s total water budget and suggests a mechanism for sequestering deep water through subduction.",

            "abstract": "Submarine channel systems transport vast amounts of terrestrial sediment into the deep sea. Understanding the dynamics of the gravity currents that create these systems, and in particular, how these flows interact with and form bends, is fundamental to predicting system architecture and evolution. Bend flow is characterized by a helical structure and in rivers typically comprises inwardly directed near-bed flow and outwardly directed near-surface flow. Following a decade of debate, it is now accepted that helical flow in submarine channel bends can exhibit a variety of structures including being opposed to that observed in rivers. The new challenge is to understand what controls the orientation of helical flow cells within submarine flows and determines the conditions for reversal. We present data from the Black Sea showing, for the first time, the three-dimensional velocity and density structure of an active submarine gravity current. By calculating the forces acting on the flow, we evaluate what controls the orientation of helical flow cells. We demonstrate that radial pressure gradients caused by across-channel stratification of the flow are more important than centrifugal acceleration in controlling the orientation of helical flow. We also demonstrate that nonlocal acceleration of the flow due to topographic forcing and downstream advection of the cross-stream flow are significant terms in the momentum balance. These findings have major implications for conceptual and numerical models of submarine channel dynamics, because they show that three-dimensional models that incorporate across-channel flow stratification are required to accurately represent curvature-induced helical flow in such systems.",

Further, it is clear that the nature of such uncertainty depends on the quality of information in (a) the forcing data (driver information), (b) the model code (prior information), and (c) the specific values of inferred model components that localize the model to the system of interest (inferred information). Of course, the relative quality of each varies with geophysical discipline and specific application.\nIn this talk I will discuss a structured approach to characterizing how ‘Information’, and hence ‘Uncertainty’, is coded into the structures of physics-based geophysical models. I propose that a better understanding of what is meant by “Information”, and how it is embodied in models and data, can offer a structured (less ad-hoc), robust and insightful basis for diagnostic learning through the model-data juxtaposition. In some fields, a natural consequence may be to emphasize the a priori role of System Architecture (Process Modeling) over that of the selection of System Parameterization, thereby emphasizing the more creative aspect of scientific investigation – the use of models for Discovery and Learning.",

An expansion of dark forests increases the absorption of solar energy and increases surface temperature, particularly in regions where the land surface is unable to compensate with latent heat flux due to water limitation. Atmospheric circulation redistributes the anomalous energy absorbed in the northern hemisphere, in particular toward the south, through altering the Hadley circulation, resulting in the northward displacement of the tropical rain bands. Precipitation decreases over parts of the Amazon basin affecting productivity and increases over the Sahel and Sahara regions in Africa. We demonstrate that the remote and local forcing of atmospheric circulation by vegetation can lead to different dynamical patterns with consequences for precipitation across the globe. These ecoclimate teleconnections represent the linkages between the land surface in different regions of the globe and by inference show that proxy records of plant cover represent not only the response of vegetation to local climate but also that vegetation's influence on global climate patterns. The ability of vegetation to affect remote circulation also has implications for strategies for climate mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The dependence of the isotopic and trace element composition of calcium carbonate minerals on growth conditions including temperature, pH, and salinity is widely used to infer paleoclimate conditions. These inferences rely heavily on phenomenological observations of biogenic and inorganic precipitation both in and ex situ, where only limited variability in solution conditions can be explored. Ionic fluxes between the mineral surface and aqueous growth solution govern the net uptake of both stoichiometric and trace species during calcification, so developing a mechanistic understanding of the reactions governing these fluxes is critical to refine existing proxies and to develop new ones. The micro-scale mechanisms of calcite precipitation from aqueous solution have been extensively studied, and net ionic uptake post-nucleation is known to occur primarily at monomolecular kink sites along step edges at the mineral surface. In this talk, I will present a theoretical framework that uses the quasi-elementary ion attachment and detachment reactions governing ion uptake at kink sites to simultaneously model bulk mineral growth kinetics and tracer partitioning during calcite precipitation. Several distinct processes occur during ion uptake at kink sites that can influence the distribution of trace species, directly impacting the composition of various carbonate paleoproxies including δ44Ca, δ18O, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca. The distribution of these trace species will be shown to depend on (1) the relative rates of ion desolvation during attachment to kink sites, (2) the relative rates of bond breaking during detachment from kink sites, and (3) the equilibrium partitioning of trace aqueous species. This model accounts for the impact of solution conditions on net ion fluxes and surface speciation, which in turn controls the population of kink sites available for direct ion exchange with the aqueous phase. The impacts of solution variables including pH, temperature and salinity can be treated independently, which unlike traditional partitioning studies allows the impacts of these parameters to be deconvolved. The type of theoretical framework discussed here can be readily extended to explicitly account for each of the major solution composition variables that are implicated in paleoproxy composition.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of thermospheric winds and temperatures near the geomagnetic equator for the regions of northeastern Brazil and central Peru show evidence for the development of meridional wind gradients for each of the two regions. Also evident is the result that the zonal winds are higher in speed for the Peru measurements when compared with the zonal winds measured in Brazil. Within the 4 degree latitude separation of Arequipa and Jicamarca, the zonal winds observed are generally the same. The Brazil site shows a difference in the meridional winds across a spatial separation of 500 km of about 20 to 40 ms-1 decrease from south to north. This gradient is seen consistently during the local summer months. Comparison of Brazil and Peru zonal winds for simultaneous nightly measurements and for averaged monthly results shows the zonal winds in the mid-evening period (21-23 LT) are generally faster by about 30 to 75 ms-1 for the Peru site which is located near or at the geomagnetic equator. These results are interpreted in terms of an inertial instability mechanism that is activated as a result of a steady state unbalanced flow. The theory of fluid dynamics applied to the thermosphere indicates that near the geographic equator where the Coriolis parameter f approaches zero, the neutral medium becomes unstable developing wave structure that may transport momentum and energy into both zonal and meridional directions.",

A multitude of geoscience disciplines, including marine, petroleum and planetary geology, as well as geohazard assessments, are concerned with the study of these units. Oftentimes, researchers working in these fields disseminate their findings within their own communities and a multidisciplinary approach seems to lack. This presentation showcases several case studies in which a broader approach has increased our understanding of submarine landslides in a variety of geologic settings. Three-dimensional seismic data from several continental margins (Trinidad, Brazil, Morocco, Canada, GOM), as well as data from outcrop localities are shown to explore geomorphological complexities associated with submarine landslides. Discussion associated with the characterization and classification of submarine landslides is also part of this work. Topics that will be cover include: 1) how data from conventional oil and gas exploration activities can be used to increase our understanding of the dynamic behavior of submarine landslides, 2) analogies between terrestrial submarine landslides and potential Martian counterparts, 3) impact of submarine landslides in margin construction, as well as their economic significance and 4) the importance of quantifying the morphology of submarine landslides in a systematic fashion.",

            "abstract": "Electron distribution functions can provide \"smoking-gun\" evidence for the detection of electron diffusion regions in collisionless magnetic reconnection. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal evolution of electron distributions during reconnection is significantly lacking, and will further elucidate the outstanding questions of how, where, and when electrons are energized during reconnection. Based on spacecraft observations and PIC simulations of symmetric reconnection, electrons in the inflow region are known to exhibit a temperature anisotropy Te// > Te⊥. Studies of exhaust electrons have reported hot and isotropic electrons, while others have reported anisotropic exhaust structures. Electron distributions in the vicinity of the X-line have a triangular, 3D velocity space structure with distinct striations corresponding to the number of times electrons reflect within the electron current layer. Here, we report the spatial and temporal evolution of electron distributions from the vicinity of the X-line to the end of the electron outflow jet, with the discovery that the discrete striations swirl and rotate as electrons re-magnetize, forming arc and ring structures. Highly structured, time-dependent electron anisotropy develops in the exhaust distributions only near or after the peak reconnection rate, explaining the previous discrepancy concerning the degree of electron anisotropy in the exhaust, and suggesting a technique to infer the evolution stage of reconnection using spacecraft measurements. We also present a theory for predicting the spacing of the striations of electron distributions in the vicinity of the X-line based on local measurements, which could be directly tested by spacecraft observations. Electron data from Cluster magnetotail reconnection inflows and exhausts exhibit many anisotropic structures as predicted by simulation. Observed distributions near the reconnection mid-plane (Bx ~ 0 nT) are often highly structured with populations exhibiting Te⊥ > Te// in addition to lower energy field-aligned beams. Our work advances the understanding of electron distribution evolution, setting a foundation to successfully interpret the high resolution electron data anticipated from NASA’s upcoming Magnetospheric Multi-Scale Mission.",

There are now multiple instruments in space capable of measuring this signal at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. We will review the state-of-the-art with respect to these relatively new satellite measurements and ongoing studies that examine the relationships with photosynthesis. Now that we have a data record spanning more than seven years, we can examine variations due to seasonal carbon uptake, interannual variability, land-use changes, and water and temperature stress. In addition, we examine how clouds and satellite viewing geometry impact the signal. We compare and contrast these variations with those from popular vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), related to the potential photosynthesis as well as with measurements from flux tower gas exchange measurements and other model-based estimates of Global Primary Productivity (GPP). Vegetation fluorescence can be simulated in global vegetation models as well as with 1D canopy radiative transport models.

            "abstract": "Earth system models have traditionally considered soil biogeochemical transformations as occurring only at the surface, neglecting C and nutrient cycling that occurs below the surface zone. However, much of the world’s soil C lies below this surface zone, and the dynamics of this carbon in response to global change may differ considerably from those at the surface. We have implemented a vertically-resolved soil biogeochemistry model into the Community Land Model (CLM4.5), and discuss the uncertainties in adding this level of increased complexity as well as the implications of this representation on the response of C cycle feedbacks. We focus on the uncertainty of how decomposition rates differ between the surface and depth, and show that this uncertainty maps strongly onto the response of soil C to warming, which is primarily due to the response of permafrost soils and their post-thaw decomposition dynamics.",

            "abstract": "S-wave splitting analyses using high SNR low frequency earthquake (LFE) templates at 3-component stations across northern Cascadia indicate the presence of a heterogeneous distribution of crustal anisotropy in the North American plate. On southern Vancouver Island (SVI), we investigate the contribution to anisotropy from the Leech River Complex (LRC), an allochthonous terrane comprising strongly foliated greenschist-facies phyllites and amphibolite-facies schists with steeply dipping foliations striking E-W. Estimates of initial S-wave polarization direction are consistent with radiation patterns predicted from LFE focal mechanisms, providing corroboration for thrust along the plate boundary. Fast directions across mainland SVI are subparallel to the dominant foliation direction in the LRC. An eastward increase in depth normalized delay times combined with small-scale azimuthal variations in fast directions suggest a heterogeneous distribution of anisotropy. We test azimuthally anisotropic LRC models constrained by surface geology and seismic reflection studies using 3D spectral element method simulations. The preferred model of a NNE shallowly dipping wedge of LRC material with varying orientation of anisotropy terminating at mid crustal levels is able to recreate mean and azimuthal variations in fast directions along with variations in delay times, supporting the hypothesis of the LRC as a primary contributor to crustal anisotropy beneath SVI. For select stations where anisotropic LRC models do not recreate observations, fast directions are subparallel to local estimates of maximal compressive horizontal stress, suggesting fluid-filled cracks could be a source of anisotropy. We refute the idea that anisotropy along mainland SVI is primarily due to stress related cracks as has been suggested by prior studies. Fast directions at northern Washington stations exhibit variations with azimuth and incidence angle suggesting complex anisotropy interpreted as due to a combination of cracks and preferred mineral orientation of metamorphosed slates of the Olympic core rocks. These slates may also underlie stations on SVI and represent another source of anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "Rapid kinematic slip inversions immediately following earthquake rupture is traditionally limited to teleseismic data and delayed many hours after large events. Regional data such as strong motion is difficult to incorporate quickly into images of the source process because baseline offsets render the long period portion of the recording unreliable. Recently it’s been demonstrated that high rate GPS can potentially produce rapid slip inversions for large events but is limited to very long periods. With an example of the 2011 M9 Tohoku-oki event we will demonstrate that the optimal on-the-fly combination of GPS and strong motion through a seismogeodetic Kalman filter produces reliable, broadband strong motion displacement and velocity waveforms that can be used for kinematic inversion. Through joint inversion of displacement and velocity waveforms we will show that it is possible to obtain a broadband image of the source. Furthermore, we will also show that it is possible to include offshore geophysical observables such as sea surface measurements of tsunami propagation from GPS buoys and ocean bottom pressure sensors into the kinematic inversion. These data better constrain the shallowest part of rupture. We will use the time-dependent deformation of bathymetry predicted from the inversion results as an initial condition for tsunami propagation and inundation modeling. Through a comparison to post-event survey observations we will demonstrate that it is possible to reproduce the inundation pattern along the coastline in great detail and argue that detailed site-specific forecast of tsunami intensity is achievable with current methods and instrumentation.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbance such as clear-cutting has been identified as an important factor for increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in boreal streams. We used a long-term dataset of soil temperature, soil moisture, shallow ground water (GW) levels and stream DOC concentrations from three boreal first-order streams to investigate mechanisms causing these increases. Clear-cutting was found to alter soil conditions with warmer and wetter soils during summer. The application of a riparian flow concentration integration model (RIM) explained a major part of variation in stream [DOC] arising from changing flow-pathways in riparian soils during the pre-treatment period (r2= 0.4-0.7), but less well after the harvest. Model residuals were highly sensitive to changes in soil temperature. The linear regression models for the temperature dependence of [DOC] in soils were not different in the disturbed and undisturbed catchments, whereas a non-linear response to soil moisture was found. Overall these results suggest that the increased DOC mobilization after forest disturbance is caused by (i) increased GW levels leading to increased water fluxes in shallow flow-path in riparian soils and (ii) increased soil temperature increasing the DOC availability in soils during summer. These relationships indicate that the mechanisms of DOC mobilization after forest disturbance are not different to those of undisturbed catchments, but that catchment soils respond to the higher hydro-climatic variation observed after clear-cutting. This highlights the sensitivity of boreal streams to changes in the energy and water balance, which may be altered as a result of both land management and climate change.",

The first part of this presentation will briefly review the state of the art of TC track and intensity forecasting. The bulk of this presentation will address important TC-related science and operational challenges. These challenges include: 1) determining the physical processes that govern TC clustering, mutually interacting TCs, and the existence of different TC genesis pathways, 2) establishing how tropical-midlatitude interactions associated with recurving and transitioning (extratropical transition) TCs can trigger downstream baroclinic development, the subsequent formation of eastward-propagating Rossby wave trains, and the ensuing occurrence of extreme weather events well downstream, and 3) identifying critical TC-related forecast problems such as forecasts of the timing and extent of coastal storm surges and inland flooding associated with landfalling TCs).

            "abstract": "Ilulissat Icefjord (IIF) has been the site of few hydrographic observations. Recent hydrographic data from Disko Bay (DB) showed a significant warming from the below of the cold Polar Water entering DB from the mid-to-late\n1990\ns onward, and the sill at the fjord mouth prevented the modified West Greenland Irminger Waters (WGIW) to fill the IIF basin. Here we identify and attempt to quantify the fluxes associated with the small-scale processes that contribute to the upward diapycnal fluxes of heat, salt and from the modified WGIW to the surface-mixed layer using five years of summer data (2009 - 2013). The interaction between the WGIW and Egedesminde Dyb trough cutting across the continental shelf from the shelf break into DB creates the cold/warm layering of water masses which contribute to the formation of double diffusive thermohaline staircases. We found evidence of thermohaline staircase consists of series of sharp interfaces across which both\nT\nand\nS\nincrease with depth separated by thick well-defined convective layers. We hypothesize that the warming of the PW layer in DB may have been caused by the upward heat fluxes from the AW driven double diffusive convection. Vertical heat fluxes estimated from laboratory-based flux laws for the diffusive regime of double diffusive convection were up to\n0.2\nWm\n−2\n. The other major player responsible for the Atlantic water heat loss is shear instabilities in the internal wave and tides generated by barotropic tidal flow over the Egedesminde Dyb trough, the continental shelf and across the sill at the entrance of IIF. Using moored pressure data, we found that the fjord could be described as a wave-fjord during neap tide and turns into a tidal jet-fjord during spring tide, therefore a weak nonlinear response due to supercritical conditions with flow separation over the sill and a linear baroclinic tidal response due to the deeper right side of the sill could be expected. We found enhanced eddy diffusivity\nK\nρ\nand dissipation rate\nϵ\nup to\n1.1×\n10\n−4\nm\n2\ns\n−1\nand\n9.81×\n10\n−6\nWkg\n−1\nrespectively in the deeper water inside IIF extending over an area more than\n10\nkm from the sill depth.

            "abstract": "Because of its great implications in the design and operation of hydraulic structures under changing environments (either climate change or anthropogenic changes), nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis has become so important and essential. Two important achievements have been made in methods. Without adhering to the consistency assumption in the traditional hydrological frequency analysis, the time-varying probability distribution of any hydrological variable can be established by linking the distribution parameters to some covariates such as time or physical variables with the help of some powerful tools like the Generalized Additive Model of Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). With the help of copulas, the multivariate nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis has also become feasible. However, applications of the nonstationary hydrological frequency formula to the design and operation of hydraulic structures for coping with the impacts of changing environments in practice is still faced with many challenges. First, the nonstationary hydrological frequency formulae with time as covariate could only be extrapolated for a very short time period beyond the latest observation time, because such kind of formulae is not physically constrained and the extrapolated outcomes could be unrealistic. There are two physically reasonable methods that can be used for changing environments, one is to directly link the quantiles or the distribution parameters to some measureable physical factors, and the other is to use the derived probability distributions based on hydrological processes. However, both methods are with a certain degree of uncertainty. For the design and operation of hydraulic structures under changing environments, it is recommended that design results of both stationary and nonstationary methods be presented together and compared with each other, to help us understand the potential risks of each method.",

However, melt composition has been shown to strongly influence element partitioning [2], implying a control from the 'melt-chemistry' as well. Additionally, element partitioning can be pressure-dependent, in which case it is a useful marker of depth for planetary processes such as mantle melting, and crust or core formation.\nTo assess the effect of melt structure on partitioning at depth, we have investigated the local structure around trace and minor elements in melts at high pressure using two in situ techniques, high energy x-ray diffraction and EXAFS. X-ray diffraction data, once converted into pair distribution functions, are straightforward to interpret and give access to the full structure although overlaps between different contributions occur. In contrast, EXAFS is a chemically-sensitive probe that describes the local structure around a given element, but is model-dependent. Both methods will be illustrated by results obtained on two types of elements, some volatiles and some lithophiles.\n",

These nucleation rates were implemented in the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA).\nTo study the principal effects, CARMA was run in a one-dimensional setup with static background fields and also with dynamically driven fields from the Kühlungsborn Mechanistic Circulation Model (KMCM) for 69°N. The ice particle properties from both runs are compared with observational data from ALOMAR (69°N). We find that while the static background conditions lead to ice particles comparable to those measured by lidar above ALOMAR, the ice particles in the dynamically driven fields do not evolve to detectable populations. To account for the horizontal transport of ice particles, we extended the model to three dimensions and added a tracer algorithm, which enables us to follow the ice particles from their genesis to final evaporation and to analyse the whole life cycle of the ice particles.\nThe modelling studies are completed by a comparison to initial laboratory results for ice nucleation rates on nanometer sized particles under realistic mesopause conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantis Massif, located at the intersection of the Atlantis transform fault and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 30°N, is one of the best-studied oceanic core complexes (OCCs) and is the target of IODP Expedition 357 late 2015. Drilling will address two exciting discoveries in ridge research: off-axis, serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal activity and carbonate precipitation, exemplified by the Lost City hydrothermal field, and the significance of tectono-magmatic processes in forming heterogeneous and variably serpentinized lithosphere as key components of slow spreading ridges. Serpentinization reactions at moderate- to low-temperatures result in alkaline fluids, characterized by elevated concentrations of abiotic hydrogen, methane and low molecular weight hydrocarbons, and which lead to precipitation of carbonate and brucite upon mixing with seawater. These highly reactive systems have major consequences for lithospheric cooling, global geochemical cycles, carbon sequestration and microbial activity. However, little is known about the nature and distribution of microbial communities in subsurface ultramafic environments and the potential for a hydrogen-based deep biosphere in areas of active serpentinization and fluid circulation. The continuous flux of reduced compounds provides abundant thermodynamic energy to drive chemolithoautotrophy, however, carbon availability may be limited in these high pH environments and represent a challenge for microbial growth. Here we review serpentinization processes as fundamental to understanding the evolution of oceanic lithosphere and discuss open questions related to the impact of serpentinization on the subsurface biosphere. Motivations for drilling the shallow subseafloor of the Atlantis Massif include: (1) exploring the extent and activity of the subsurface biosphere in young ultramafic and mafic seafloor; (2) quantifying the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, in sustaining microbiological communities and in the sequestration of carbon in ultramafic rocks; (3) assessing how abiotic and biotic processes change with aging of the lithosphere and with variations in rock type; and (4) characterizing tectono-magmatic processes at OCCs and the evolution of hydrothermal activity associated with detachment faulting.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 ppbv to a range of 60-70 ppbv on the basis of the latest health evidence. Rising Asian emissions, more frequent wildfires, and poorly understood deep stratospheric intrusions may pose challenges to achieving more stringent ozone standards over high-elevation Western U.S. (WUS) regions. Understanding the factors driving daily to decadal variability in sources of ozone is thus relevant to an effective implementation of the ozone NAAQS in WUS states. Here I present a detailed analysis of WUS surface ozone variability during 1980-2050, based on observations and a suite of chemistry-climate model simulations designed to isolate the role of changes in meteorology, background, STT, wildfires, methane, and Asian vs. North American anthropogenic emissions. Our analysis identifies the key role of stratospheric intrusion frequency on year-to-year variability in springtime high-ozone events measured at high-elevation WUS sites. We show more frequent late spring deep stratospheric intrusions when the polar jet stream meanders towards the southwestern United States, as occurs following strong La Niña conditions. Fewer and weaker intrusion events followed the pronounced positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in response to volcanic aerosols from the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.\nWith Asian emissions, global methane, and meteorology varying with time, the model simulates a background ozone increase of 0.20-0.45 ppb yr-1 (P≤0.01) at high-elevation WUS sites for spring during 1988-2012. With global methane and meteorology varying with time, the model shows an increasing ozone trend of 0.1-0.2 ppb yr-1 in spring (0.01<P≤0.05). For summer, increasing Eurasian and North American boreal fires in the 2000s as compared to the 1980s contribute to simulated increases in background ozone over the northeastern U.S., with implications for possibly more frequent fires in a warming climate. I will further discuss the extent to which projected changes in methane and Asian emissions in RCP8.5 and 4.5 scenarios contribute to lower tropospheric ozone changes over the WUS during 2005-2050.",

            "abstract": "Magmas degas volatiles during ascent from the mantle and mafic melts with 7 wt% H2O attain volatile saturation at ~15km depth. Magmatic gases are dominated by H2O, CO2 and S species, independent of their tectonic setting. At rift volcanoes, C is sourced from the mantle whereas arc volcanoes sample both mantle and subducted C.\nVolcanic gases provide detailed information on volatile sources and degassing processes. Comparison of fumarole gases with melt inclusions and volcanic plumes shows that most fumaroles sample degassed magma. Water, CO2 and S vary significantly between tectonic settings. The Kuriles, Japan, and Kamchatka have H2O/CO2 of 40 to 800 while other arcs such as the Cascades, Central America, S. America, Java, and Aeolian have ratios of 1 to 70. Gases from rift volcanoes have H2O/CO2 between 3 and 9. Some of these variations are due to addition of meteoric and subducted water, as evidenced by O and H isotopes. Speciation of H and C in volcanic gases are typically controlled by redox buffer reactions imposed by the Fe3+-Fe2+ (i.e. QFM) rock buffer or the SO2-H2S gas buffer. In more exotic systems such as Poás, hydrothermal S phases such as liquid native S can play a role in high T gas C and H speciation.\nArcs dominate the global subaerial volcanic CO2 emission budget and arc total fluxes vary significantly i.e. only about 2 t/yr/km from the Aleutians and about 65 t/yr/km from Central America. Reasons for this are poorly constrained and may include variability in subducted material or slab/mantle conditions at depth. A large uncertainty results from use of generalized arc-wide C/S ratios, used in calculating C fluxes, and the paucity of data for remote arcs. Resolving C fluxes from subducted versus mantle or crustal (assimilated) C relies on C isotope ratios, which can vary spatially and temporally as a function of source or degassing processes. Therefore, when considering the deep C cycle and Cexchange between the interior and surface of the Earth, integrated studies with complete gas compositions, plume C/S and flux measurements, C isotopes and melt inclusions are needed.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is increasingly used to reconstruct paleotemperatures of ancient terrestrial environments. One promising application is elucidating paleoelevation from carbonate archives such as paleosols, lacustrine marls, and fossil freshwater shells. Unlike conventional stable isotope approaches (e.g., mineral δ18O or δD), clumped isotope thermometry is independent of the isotopic composition of the precipitating waters and can therefore be used to reconstruct elevation by both the temperature-altitude relationship and the rainfall δ18O-altitude relationship. However, interpretation of clumped isotope data is not without its own complications. Like conventional stable isotopes, clumped isotope paleotemperatures can be effectively reset to warmer values by dissolution/reprecipitation-type diagenesis during sedimentary burial. It is also known that carbonate clumped isotope bonds (i.e., 13C-18O) are susceptible to ‘reordering’ in the solid mineral lattice at warmer burial temperatures, with laboratory studies of natural carbonates indicating activation of this phenomenon at temperatures as low as 100 °C over geologic timescales. A challenge in applying carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to natural samples is now evaluating terrestrial archives with respect to both types of alteration: ‘open-system’ alteration and ‘closed-system’ bond reordering. In this talk we will review our experimental efforts to constrain the kinetics of clumped isotope reordering, with relevance to low-temperature carbonates like fossil shells and early diagenetic minerals, and present new laboratory data that further inform our theoretical framework for the mechanism(s) of 13C-18O bond reordering. Together with traditional analytical and petrographic screening for recrystallization, empirical and laboratory studies of carbonate clumped isotope reordering represent the next steps in evaluating isotopic records of paleoclimate, paleobiology, and paleoelevation that are emerging from clumped isotope analyses.",

            "abstract": "One of the mysteries of Mars’ geology is the origin of widespread, layered, friable deposits that likely formed through air fall deposition. The enigmatic chaos terrains are largely composed of such deposits, as are many of the most intriguing layered, clay- and sulfate-bearing deposits of astrobiological interest. Such deposits are most likely of volcanic origin, but lack an obvious source, based on comparison with well-known volcanic provinces [1]. We suggest that these deposits may have been sourced from previously unrecognized explosive volcanoes in Arabia Terra. While Arabia is not traditionally considered to be a volcanic region, we propose that several of the large depressions in the area are in fact calderas that formed through a combination of structural collapse and explosive volcanism. These features are characterized by the observation of sets of nested depressions, association with ridged plains, development of ring fractures and faults, the presence of interior slump blocks, and direct association, in some cases, with friable deposits, lavas and evidence for lava lakes. Eden Patera is the type example and shows evidence for three nested calderas with >4000 km3 of collapse volume. Siloe Patera also contains a set of nested collapse features that occur within a zone of demagnetized crust that might indicate the presence of a magma chamber at shallow depth [2]. It is not yet clear why explosive volcanoes may have formed in Arabia Terra, but we suggest that they might represent the rapid rise of mafic magmas through a thin crust. They might represent more silicic or volatile-rich magmas, but these scenarios do not appear to be necessary [3]. We suggest that explosive mafic volcanism was an important aspect of early Martian geological processes.\n[1] Kerber, L., Head III, J., Madeleine, J. B., Forget, F. & Wilson, L.

            "abstract": "In this study, a new methodology is developed to improve the climate simulation of state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, by post-processing based on the inter-model diversity (i.e. ensemble spread from the Multi-Model Ensemble (MME)). Based on the close connection between the interannual variability and climatological state, the distinctive relation between the inter-model diversity of the interannual variability, and that of the basic state, is found. Based on this relation, the simulated interannual variabilities can be improved, by correcting their climatological bias. In order to test this methodology, the dominant inter-model difference in precipitation responses during the ENSO is investigated, and its relationship with climatological state. It is found that the dominant inter-model diversity of the ENSO precipitation in CMIP5 is associated with the zonal location shift of the positive precipitation center during El Nino. This dominant inter-model difference is significantly correlated with the difference in the basic state. The models with wetter (dryer) climatology than the climatology of the MME over the central Pacific, tend to shift positive ENSO precipitation anomalies to the east (west). Based on the model’s systematic errors in atmospheric ENSO response and bias, it is shown that the models with better climatological state tend to simulate more realistic atmospheric ENSO responses. Therefore, the statistical method to correct the ENSO response by minimizing mean bias mostly improves the ENSO response. After the statistical correction, the deficiencies in simulating the MME ENSO precipitation are improved, so that the pattern correlation of tropical atmospheric MME response is increased from 0.81 before the correction, to 0.92 after the correction. In particular, this improvement is robust in the models whose original response is far from realistic. These results provide the possibility that the methodology developed in this study can also be applied to improve climate projection and seasonal climate prediction.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the abundance of highly anisotropic minerals in the crust, the Voigt and Reuss bounds on the seismic velocities can be separated by more than 1 km/s. These bounds are determined by modal mineralogy and crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) of the constituent minerals, but where the true velocities lie between these bounds is determined by other fabric parameters such as the shapes, shape-preferred orientations, and spatial arrangements of grains. Thus, the calculation of accurate bulk stiffness relies on explicitly treating the grain-scale heterogeneity, and the same principle applies at larger scales, for example calculating accurate bulk stiffness for a crustal volume with varying proportions and distributions of folds or shear zones.\nWe have developed stand-alone GUI software – ESP Toolbox – for the calculation of 3D bulk elastic and seismic properties of heterogeneous and polycrystalline materials using image or EBSD data. The GUI includes a number of different homogenization techniques, including Voigt, Reuss, Hill, geometric mean, self-consistent and asymptotic expansion homogenization (AEH) methods. The AEH method, which uses a finite element mesh, is most accurate since it explicitly accounts for elastic interactions of constituent minerals/phases. The user need only specify the microstructure and material properties of the minerals/phases.\nWe use the Toolbox to explore changes in bulk elasticity and related seismic anisotropy caused by specific variables, including: (a) the quartz alpha-beta phase change in rocks with varying proportions of quartz, (b) changes in modal mineralogy and CPO fabric that occur during progressive deformation and metamorphism, and (c) shear zones of varying thickness, abundance and geometry in continental crust. The Toolbox allows rapid sensitivity analysis around these and other variables, and the resulting bulk stiffness matrices can be used to populate volumes for synthetic wave propagation experiments that allow direct visualization of how variables of interest might affect propagation at a variety of scales. Sensitivity analyses also illustrate the value of the more precise AEH method.\nThe ESP Toolbox can be downloaded here:\nhttp://umaine.edu/mecheng/faculty-and-staff/senthil-vel/software/",

            "abstract": "Shallow ice within Enceladus experiences oscillating tidal stresses and ambient stresses from lateral buoyancy contrasts between warm and cold ice. Ice does not distinguish between these remote sources of stress. Frictional failure occurs when the total stress on a crack surface exceeds its frictional strength. Failure on pervasive distributed cracks has the net effect of creep from internal friction. Strong tidal stresses drive net strain within the ice mass with the orientation to relieve modest buoyancy stresses and hence plate-like convection. Analogous processes occur when strong surface waves pass through the shallow subsurface. (1) The upmost 10s of meters moves down a shallow slope from ambient topographic stresses during shaking. The net effect, a sacking, is a slow deep landslide over many earthquakes. (2) The shallow ambient tectonic stress is relieved by distributed frictional slip during shaking. Deeper tectonic movements then restore the stress. Repeated events facilate long-term shallow tectonic deformation as on Enceladus. (3) The impinging surface waves impose strain boundary conditions on the shallow subsurface. Stiff rock fails in friction and cracks. The resulting damaged rock is more compliant than intact rock and experiences lower stresses during the net shaking. A seismic regolith where the shear modulus increases linearly with depth eventually self-organizes so the regolith layer barely reaches frictional failure during strong events. A tidal regolith of this type may exist on Enceladus. It barely fails down to its base at times of peak tidal stress. (4) Ice, like rock, becomes weak once frictional slip is underway. Large stress drops and even overshoot occur. Local residual stresses from one event become prestresses for the next event. Favorably oriented stress patches fail from tidal stresses that are below the nominal frictional criterion.",

The basin is home to some of the most intensive oil and gas production in the region, activities that have been accelerated by new technologies in that industry. High ozone episodes are coincident with the presence of snow and “cold pool” conditions during which a stable shallow boundary layer persists for periods of up to 10 days. Local emissions of NOx and VOCs build up within this layer, but the sources of radicals that initiate the photochemistry have been unclear since low photolysis rates and water vapor make the traditional channel, ozone photolysis, quite inefficient. Intensive studies over the past 3 winter seasons have shown that unconventional radical sources; primarily carbonyls, and to a lesser extent nitryl chloride and nitrous acid, are responsible for radical production in this environment. The role of snow cover is to restrict vertical mixing, enhance photolysis rates through increased albedo, and reduce ozone deposition. The uptake and production of photo-labile species on the snow surface were observed, but appear to have only minor influences on the ozone photochemistry.",

            "abstract": "The use of hybrid error covariance models has become quite popular for numerical weather prediction (NWP). One such method for incorporating localized covariances from an ensemble within the variational framework utilizes an augmented control variable (EnVar), and has been implemented in the operational NCEP data assimilation system (GSI). By taking the existing 3D EnVar algorithm in GSI and allowing for four-dimensional ensemble perturbations, coupled with the 4DVAR infrastructure already in place, a 4D EnVar capability has been developed. The 4D EnVar algorithm has a few attractive qualities relative to 4DVAR, including the lack of need for tangent-linear and adjoint model as well as reduced computational cost. Preliminary results using real observations have been encouraging, showing forecast improvements nearly as large as were found in moving from 3DVAR to hybrid 3D EnVar. 4D EnVar is the method of choice for the next generation assimilation system for use with the operational NCEP global model, the global forecast system (GFS).\nThe use of an outer-loop has long been the method of choice for 4DVar data assimilation to help address nonlinearity. An outer loop involves the re-running of the (deterministic) background forecast from the updated initial condition at the beginning of the assimilation window, and proceeding with another inner loop minimization. Within 4D EnVar, a similar procedure can be adopted since the solver evaluates a 4D analysis increment throughout the window, consistent with the valid times of the 4D ensemble perturbations. In this procedure, the ensemble perturbations are kept fixed and centered about the updated background state. This is analogous to the quasi-outer loop idea developed for the EnKF. Here, we present results for both toy model and real NWP systems demonstrating the impact from incorporating outer loops to address nonlinearity within the 4D EnVar context. The appropriate amplitudes for observation and background error covariances in subsequent outer loops will be explored.\nLastly, variable transformations on the ensemble perturbations will be utilized to help address issues of non-Gaussianity. This may be particularly important for variables that clearly have non-Gaussian error characteristics such as water vapor and cloud condensate.",

            "abstract": "The Keeling curve, which shows the rapidly increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration since 1958, is one of the most important scientific findings of our time – yet a full and detailed understanding of the curve and its variations is still to be achieved. At year-to-year time scales, for instance, the annual growth rate of the Keeling curve have long been linked to variations of the natural climate-carbon system. But questions remain about what (ocean versus land), where (tropics versus mid-high latitudes) and how (e.g., temperature versus precipitation) different drivers affect the observed variability. At longer (multidecadal) timescales, on the other hand, the growths of atmospheric CO2 concentration have almost been constantly proportional (by the so-called “airborne fraction”) to the corresponding anthropogenic emissions. This study reviews the literature on these questions and presents a box model to describe carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and the surface reservoirs under the disturbances of anthropogenic emissions as well as global climate changes. The results show that the simple linear model can successfully simulate the observed changes/variations of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and its growth rate across interannual to multi-decadal time scales.",

            "abstract": "Nearly the entire state of California experienced exceptionally dry conditions during 2013 and early 2014. Statewide 12-month accumulated precipitation was less than 34% of average over this period, leading to a wide range of adverse impacts upon both human and natural systems. The California drought occurred in tandem with a persistent region of positive geopotential height (GPH) anomalies associated with high-amplitude ridging over the northeastern Pacific Ocean (i.e. the so-called “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”), which displaced the jet stream well to the north of its climatological mean position and prevented winter storms from reaching California during the canonical wet season. Remarkably, the extreme dipolar flow pattern induced by this recurrent anticyclone over the northeastern Pacific occurred during two consecutive winter seasons, which helped to accelerate the onset of severe drought conditions in California.\nWe find that the extreme GPH values during 2013 were observationally unprecedented over a vast region covering most of the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent land areas, and that California experienced both its driest calendar year and driest consecutive 12-month period in at least 119 years. We also assess the role of climate change in affecting the likelihood of occurrence of the large-scale conditions linked to the California drought, and find that global warming has very likely increased the likelihood of extreme GPH events in this region. Together, the complexity and severity of the observed drought impacts, coupled with our finding that global warming has increased the probability of large-scale conditions similar to those associated with the 2013/14 drought, suggest that understanding the link between climate change and persistent North Pacific ridging events will be crucial in characterizing the future risk of severe drought in California.",

            "abstract": "Ethane (C2H6) is the second-most abundant alkane in most natural gas reservoirs, and is used to produce ethylene for petrochemical industries.\nIt is arguably the simplest molecule that can manifest multiple 13C substitutions. There are several plausible controls on ∆13C2H6in natural gas: thermodynamically controlled homogeneous isotope exchange reactions analogous to those behind carbonate clumped isotope thermometry; inheritance from larger biomolecules that undergo thermal degradation to produce natural gas; mixing of natural gases that differ markedly in bulk isotopic composition; diffusive fractionation; or combinations of these and/or other, less expected fractionations. There is little basis for predicting which of these will control isotopic variations among natural ethanes, but we think it likely that addition of this new isotopic proxy will reveal new insights into the natural chemistry of ethane.\nWe have developed a method to measure the abundance of 13C2H6 in natural samples, using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We define ∆13C2H6 as 1000 . ((13C2H6/12C2H6)measured/(13C2H6/12C2H6)stochastic -1). We studied several suites of natural gas samples and experimentally produced or modified ethane. Natural ethanes, including closely related samples from a single natural gas field, exhibit surprisingly large ranges in ∆13C2H6 (4 ‰ overall; up to 3 ‰ in one gas field). Such ranges cannot be explained by thermodynamic equilibrium at a range of different temperatures, or by diffusive fractionation. Kinetic isotope effects associated with ‘cracking’ reactions, and/or inheritance of non-equilibrium carbon isotope structures from source organics are more likely causes. We observe a correlation between ∆13C2H6 and the concentration of alkanes other than methane in several suites of natural gases, suggesting the causes of clumped isotope variations are tied to the controls on gas wetness. An experiment examining ethane residual to high-temperature pyrolysis confirms this trend could be an isotopic fingerprint for ethane destruction.",

            "abstract": "The last four decades have seen a remarkable decline in the spatial extent of the Arctic sea ice cover, presenting both challenges and opportunities to Arctic residents, government agencies and industry. After the record low extent in September 2007 effort has increased to improve seasonal, decadal-scale and longer-term predictions of the sea ice cover. Coupled global climate models (GCMs) consistently project that if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, the eventual outcome will be a complete loss of the multiyear ice cover. However, confidence in these projections depends o HoHoweon the models ability to reproduce features of the present-day climate. Comparison between models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and observations of sea ice extent and thickness show that (1) historical trends from 85% of the model ensemble members remain smaller than observed, and (2) spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. Part of the explanation lies with a failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. These results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may be realized.\nOn shorter time-scales, seasonal sea ice prediction has been challenged to predict the sea ice extent from Arctic conditions a few months to a year in advance. Efforts such as the Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) project, originally organized through the Study of Environmental Change (SEARCH) and now managed by the Sea Ice Prediction Network project (SIPN) synthesize predictions of the September sea ice extent based on a variety of approaches, including heuristic, statistical and dynamical modeling. Analysis of SIO contributions reveals that when the September sea ice extent is near the long-term trend, contributions tend to be accurate. Years when the observed extent departs from the trend have proven harder to predict. Predictability skill does not appear to be more accurate for dynamical models over statistical ones, nor is there a measurable improvement in skill as the summer progresses.",

            "abstract": "Since the establishment of the IAEA-WMO precipitation-monitoring network in 1961, it has been observed that isotope ratios in precipitation (δ2H and δ18O) generally decrease from coastal to inland locations, an observation described as the continental effect. While discussed frequently in the literature, there have been few attempts to quantify the variables controlling this effect despite the fact that isotopic gradients over continents vary by orders of magnitude. In a number of studies, traditional Rayleigh fractionation has proven inadequate in describing the global variability of isotopic gradients due to its simplified treatment of moisture transport and its lack of moisture recycling through evapotranspiration (ET). We use a one-dimensional idealized model of water vapor transport along a storm track to investigate the dominant variables controlling isotopic gradients in precipitation across terrestrial environments. We find that the sensitivity of these gradients to progressive rainout is controlled primarily by ET with secondary controls exerted by eddy transport. A comparison of modern isotopic gradients within high elevation continental interior regions shows that the effects of seasonal changes in ET are of the same order of magnitude as the effects of rainout due to orographic precipitation. This implies that changing climate and associated changes in ET rates may amplify or completely negate isotopic signals of uplift. We further apply the model to a spatial compilation of Cenozoic isotopic records throughout Central Asia. Over the past 50 Ma, extensive recycling of water via ET has likely masked isotopic signals of the uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau, Tian Shan, Altai, and Hangay ranges as revealed by complimentary methods of measuring uplift timing and rates. Our results highlight the importance of the coupling between topography, atmospheric circulation, and biological processes in controlling isotopic records of past climate.",

In many other domains, especially those where data are primarily acquired by individual investigators or small teams (known as ‘Long-tail data’), data are poorly shared and integrated, lacking a community-based data infrastructure that ensures persistent access, quality control, standardization, and integration of data, as well as appropriate tools to fully explore and mine the data within the context of broader Earth Science datasets.\nIEDA (Integrated Earth Data Applications, www.iedadata.org) is a data facility funded by the US NSF to develop and operate data services that support data stewardship throughout the full life cycle of observational data in the solid earth sciences, with a focus on the data management needs of individual researchers. IEDA builds on a strong foundation of mature disciplinary data systems for marine geology and geophysics, geochemistry, and geochronology. These systems have dramatically advanced data resources in those long-tail Earth science domains. IEDA has strengthened these resources by establishing a consolidated, enterprise-grade infrastructure that is shared by the domain-specific data systems, and implementing joint data curation and data publication services that follow community standards. In recent years, other domain-specific data efforts have partnered with IEDA to take advantage of this infrastructure and improve data services to their respective communities with formal data publication, long-term preservation of data holdings, and better sustainability.

However, the IEPOX reaction probability (γIEPOX) and its dependence upon particle composition remain poorly constrained. We report measurements of γIEPOX for trans-b-IEPOX, the predominant IEPOX isomer, on submicron particles as a function of composition, acidity, and relative humidity (RH). Particle acidity had the strongest effect. γIEPOX is more than 500 times larger on ammonium bisulfate (γ ~ 0.05) than on ammonium sulfate (γ ≤ 1 x 10-4). We could accurately predict γIEPOX using an acid-catalyzed, epoxide ring-opening mechanism and a high Henry’s law coefficient (1.6 x 108 M/atm). Suppression of γIEPOX was observed in particles containing both ammonium bisulfate and polyethylene glycol (PEG-300), likely due to diffusion and solubility limitations within a PEG-300 coating, suggesting that IEPOX uptake could be self-limiting. Using the measured uptake kinetics, the predicted atmospheric lifetime of IEPOX is a few hours in the presence of highly acidic particles (pH < 0), but is greater than a day on less acidic particles (pH > 3). We connect these net reactive uptake measurements to chamber studies of the SOA yield from IEPOX multiphase chemistry and discuss the implications of these findings for modeling the anthropogenic influence upon SOA formation from isoprene.",

We have developed an environmentally robust instrument for automated measurement of expansion and contraction in tree diameter that can be deployed in remote locations (TreeHuggers; TH). TH uses a membrane potentiometer to measure changes in circumference with resolution ≤ 6 mm at user-selected intervals (≥ 1 min). Simultaneous measurement of temperature is used to correct for the thermal properties of the stainless steel band. Data are stored on micro SD cards and transmitted tree-to-tree to a base station. Preliminary measurement of beech trees shows the precise initiation of growth and the emergence of diel changes in stem diameter associated with sap flow. Because of their low cost and on-board data logging and communication packages, TH will greatly increase the capacity of the scientific community and private sectors to monitor tree growth and carbon storage. Possible applications include deploying TH in the footprint of eddy covariance sites to help interpret drivers affecting net ecosystem exchange and evapotranspiration. A large scale implementation of TH will contribute to our ability to forecast changes in the carbon sink strength of forests across environmental gradients and biotic disturbances, and they could prove useful in assessing changes in forest stocks as part of evaluating carbon offsets purchased by commercial entities.",

For the past 10 years, UNAVCO has managed Research Experiences in the Solid Earth Sciences for Students (RESESS), an NSF-funded multiyear geoscience research internship, community support, and professional development program. The primary goal of the RESESS program is to increase the number of historically underrepresented students entering the geosciences, whether continuing academic studies or moving into the workforce.\nBeginning in 2014, UNAVCO will add a second internship program to its portfolio. Leading Undergraduates in Challenges to Power Academic Development in the Geosciences (LAUNCHPAD) is aimed at involving two-year college students and lower-division undergraduates in projects that prepare them for independent research opportunities at UNAVCO and with other REU programs. LAUNCHPAD will assist early-academic career students in understanding and developing the skills necessary to transition to undergraduate research programs or to prepare for positions in the geoscience technical workforce. In order to ensure a continued student support structure, UNAVCO will host and run a two-day institute, the Faculty Institute for RESESS Mentoring Excellence (FIRME), for faculty mentors to develop their mentoring acumen, with particular focus on mentoring and supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds.

            "abstract": "Subsurface thermal erosion is triggered by convective heat transfers between flowing water and permafrost. For inland ice-wedge polygon terrains, heat advection due to infiltration of run-off in the massive ice wedges and the ice-rich upper portion of permafrost creates sink holes and networks of interconnected tunnels in the permafrost. Mass movements such as collapse of tunnel’s roof, retrogressive thaw-slumping along exposed permafrost and active layer detachment slides lead to the development of extensive gully networks in the landscape. These gullies drastically change the hydrology of ice-wedge polygon terrains and the fluxes of heat, water, sediment and carbon within the permafrost geosystem. Exportation of sediments by fluvial processes within gullies are positive mechanical feed-back effects that keep gully channels active over decades. Along gully margins, drainage of disturbed polygons and ponds, slope drainage, soil consolidation, plant colonization of disturbed gully slopes and wet to mesic plant succession of drained polygons change the thermal properties of the active layer and create negative feedback effects that stabilize active erosion processes and promote permafrost recovery in gully slopes and adjacent disturbed polygons. On Bylot Island (Nunavut), over 40 gullies were mapped and monitored to characterize gully geomorphology, thermal and mechanical processes of gully erosion, rates of gully erosion over time within different sedimentary deposits, total volume of eroded permafrost at the landscape scale and gully hydrology. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to quantify heat convection processes and speed of ice wedge ablation in order to derive empirical equations to develop a numerical, fully-coupled, heat and mass (water) transfer model of ice-wedge thermal erosion. We used data collected over 10 years of geomorphological gully monitoring, regional climate scenarios, our physics-based numerical thermal erosion model and our field/laboratory-based empirical thermal erosion model to evaluate the potential response of ice-wedge polygon terrains to changes in snow, permafrost thermal regime and hydrological conditions over the coming decades and its implication for the short and long term dynamics of arctic permafrost geosystems.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of converted seismic phases in regions of mantle upwelling and melting have identified Sp phases originating from a depth similar to the expected depth of melting onset. Using 1D melt migration models together with 1D synthetic receiver functions, we have investigated the conditions required to generate the observed converted phases. The magnitude of the synthetic melting onset phases increases with increasing upwelling velocity, increasing shear viscosity, and decreasing water content. The water content of erupted lavas at Hawaii and Galapagos suggest a hydrated mantle source. For the standard relationship of seismic velocity on melt fraction used here, if water is homogeneously distributed within the mantle source, the resulting seismic velocity gradients would not produce the observed converted phases. One way to explain the observed phases is that wet and dry components in the mantle source are heterogeneously distributed and melt independently. A relatively dry plume that entrains water as it passes through a hydrated transition zone could result in favorable conditions for generation the observed phases. Alternatively, experiment and theory show a sharp reduction in relaxed elastic modulus at the onset of melting, attributed to decreasing diffusion length scales upon the formation of an interconnected melt network. Thus, a stronger dependence of seismic velocity on low melt fractions at melting onset may account for the observed converted phases.",

            "abstract": "Operational drought monitoring has long suffered from poor representation of evaporative dynamics, with popular drought indices—such as the PDSI that informs much of the US Drought Monitor (USDM)—primarily relying on precipitation and temperature (T) to represent hydroclimatic anomalies. When evaporative demand (Eo) has been used, it has most often been derived from poorly performing T-based parameterizations that are then used in LSMs to derive actual evapotranspiration (ET). Our goal is to create a drought index that both improves the representation of evaporative dynamics in drought and offers a useful leading indicator of both flash and sustained droughts. This presentation will outline the physical basis for such an index: the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI).\nEDDI measures the physical response of Eo to surface drying anomalies that occur due to two distinct land surface/atmosphere interactions. In sustained drought, when moisture is limited at the land surface, Eo and ET vary in a complementary relationship: as ET declines, Eo increases due to the energy balance tipping to favor sensible heating. In flash droughts (before surface moisture limitations), ET and Eo both rise in response to increases in advection, radiation, or temperature, or decreases in humidity. Thus, Eo rises in response to both drought types (in contrast to ET-based drought measures), suggesting strong potential for use as a leading indicator of both drought types.\nFor Eo, we use reference ET (ETo) from the ASCE Standardized ",

            "abstract": "Most interpretations of the Himalaya and southern Tibet have been made assuming large-scale west-east uniformity of the orogen co-axial with the surface trace of the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture (YZS), and assuming that the main structural elements can be captured with a single south-north cross-section. The HiCLIMB seismic transect is interpreted to show Indian lithospheric mantle attached to Indian lower crust and underthrusting horizontally to the northernmost extent of that crust at ~31°N at ~85°E. The older INDEPTH seismic transect had been interpreted to show Indian lithospheric mantle detaching from Indian crust (at the “mantle suture”) beneath the surface trace of the YZS, ~29.5°N at ~90°E.\nWe present P-wave and S-wave receiver-function CCP images along a new seismic transect, with about double the station density of the INDEPTH transect, along 92°E from the High Himalaya across the Tethyan Himalaya and Lhasa terrane, to the Bangong-Nujiang Suture. We image a prominent converter dipping c. 25°N from near-surface to c. 150 km depth that we interpret as the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture in the crust and the Tibetan lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in the mantle. Sub-parallel and structurally deeper we interpret other converters as top and base of subducting Indian lithospheric mantle, detaching from underhtrusting Indian crust at the mantle suture >50 km south of the surface trace of the YZS. Based on this and the HiCLIMB image, as well as body-wave and surface-wave tomography, and potential-field and geochemical data, we believe the mantle suture is not parallel to the YZS at the surface, but rotated 25°CW.\nIn contrast, Indian crust seems to penetrate a fairly uniform distance beneath Tibet over a large sector of the orogen at least from 85° to 92°E, to the \"Indian crustal front\" >150 km north of the YZS. Thus underplating of Indian crust beneath the Lhasa Terrane may controlled by the geometry of collision as recorded by the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture at the surface, whereas progressive detachment of Indian mantle lithosphere from Indian crust may be related to stresses at the eastern syntaxis associated with ongoing subduction of the Burma plate. Irrespective of the cause, we infer that the relative geometry of subduction of Indian crust and Indian mantle lithosphere varies dramatically from west to east across Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Seismic noise holds a two-fold interest for global geophysics. It is a source of energy that may be used to form 3D tomographic images of the Earth. It is also an observable that provides a continuous, and in some cases, multi-decadal record of ocean storm activity. Potential insights include the understanding of global changes in patterns of storm location and severity, and inputs to models of carbon dioxide entrainment into the oceans. While any continuous seismic record has the potential to contribute knowledge on ambient seismic noise (microseisms), seismic arrays provide information that includes inference of the seismic slowness and backazimuth of incoming signals. Given that noise observations have no onset time, array techniques are very important in contributing signal properties that allow backprojection and hence location determination for storm sources.\nSeismic arrays located in Australia and southeast Asia enable deep ocean noise sources from much of the Southern Ocean and western Pacific to be investigated. We analyze seismic records including those from the Warramunga (WRA), Alice Springs (ASAR) and Pilbara (PSAR) arrays together with WAVEWATCH III oceanographic reanalysis models. We use the IAS Capon technique to identify incoming signals with the aim of detecting multiple noise sources impinging on the array at any one time. The combination of multi-decadal records from WRA, and multi-array perspectives for recent years provides an opportunity to observe seismic noise across a range of frequencies and across many years of seasonal variation.\nWe find some noise sources are consistent between different arrays, but others seem to be much better observed by a particular single array. We summarize these insights with a view to optimizing decadal plans for future installations of multiple arrays. Further, we address the challenge of using new arrays together with existing arrays with contrasting station configurations. Multiple array methods afford the opportunity of better understanding complex, extended ocean sources of seismic energy.",

            "abstract": "The surface uplift history of the Central Andean Plateau remains one of the most important unresolved issues in the tectonics of South America. Several studies have suggested that the region was rapidly uplifted during the Miocene as an isostatic response to delamination of a crustal root, but other studies have disputed these interpretations. A wealth of geological data have been brought to bear on the problem, but stable isotope paleoaltimetry is particularly relevant for understanding the surface uplift history of an orogen because it is based on the relationship between surface elevation and precipitation isotopic composition. To the extent that the altitude effects on isotopic composition can be disentangled from other atmospheric influences on proxy records, the technique can provide unique constraints on the surface elevation history of a region.\nChanges in water vapor sources, evaporation, and air parcel trajectories have all been recognized as influencing paleoelevation proxies. Precipitation in the Central Andean Plateau is affected by the South American Monsoon, where atmospheric deep convection can exert a very large influence on water vapor isotopic composition. Recent theoretical advances and observational studies have provided new constraints on these influence, with important implications for isotope-based paleoaltimetry studies.\nTwo important processes that are active in South America can induce substantial deviations from the traditional Rayleigh paradigm. Subcloud evaporation and vapor recycling during continental convection can lower water vapor dD values by several 10s of per mil below that predicted by Rayleigh distillation, and mixing between moist and dry air parcels can raise water vapor dD by a similar amount above that predicted by Rayleigh distillation. Furthermore, small shifts in the position of the Bolivian high can induce very rapid, large changes in the lateral distribution of precipitation d values. We use isotopic data from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) to show that the magnitude of these changes is comparable to those induced by surface uplift of the Central Andean Plateau, suggesting that the history of monsoonal and mixing influences in the region must be better constrained for successful paleoaltimetry interpretations.",

Yet, the exponential growth in human population is putting the ocean and thus life on our planet at risk. However, based on student evaluations from our introductory oceanography course it is clear that our students have deficiencies in ocean literacy that impact their ability to recognize that the ocean and humans are inextricably connected. Furthermore, life present in deep subsurface marine environments is also interconnected to the study of the ocean, yet the deep biosphere is not typically covered in undergraduate oceanography courses. In an effort to improve student ocean literacy we developed an instructional module on the deep biosphere focused on gas hydrate deposits. Specifically, our module utilizes Google Earth and cutting edge research about microbial life in the ocean to support three inquiry-based activities that each explore different facets of gas hydrates (i.e. environmental controls, biologic controls, and societal implications). The relevant nature of the proposed module also makes it possible for instructors of introductory geology courses to modify module components to discuss related topics, such as climate, energy, and geologic hazards. This work, which will be available online as a free download, is a solid contribution toward increasing the available teaching resources focused on the deep biosphere for geoscience educators. ",

            "abstract": "For over 200 years, fossil fuels have been the basis for an industrial revolution that has delivered a level of prosperity to modern society unimaginable during the previous 5000 years of human civilization. However, society’s dependence on fossil fuels is coming to an end for two reasons. The first reason is because our fossil fuel reserves are running out, oil in this century, natural gas during the next century, and coal a few centuries later. The second reason is because fossil fuels are having a devastating impact on the habitability of our planet, disrupting our climate system and acidifying our oceans. So the question is not whether we will discontinue using fossil fuels, but rather whether we will stop using them before they do irreparable damage to the Earth’s life-support systems.\nWithin our geoscience community, climate scientists have determined that a majority of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain unburned if dangerous climate change and ocean acidification are to be avoided. In contrast, Exxon-Mobil, Shell, and other members of the fossil fuel industry are pursuing a business model that assumes all of their reserves will be burned and will not become stranded assets. Since the geosciences have had a long and mutually beneficial relationship with the fossil fuel industry, this inherent conflict between climate science and industrial interests presents an ethical dilemma for many geoscientists. This conflict is further heightened by the fossil fuel divestment movement, which is underway at over 400 college and university campuses around the world. This presentation will explore some of the ethical and financial issues being raised by the divestment movement from a geoscientist’s perspective.",

Regional model output comes from the NARCCAP archive and simulations by an Arctic version of WRF; global model output comes from the CMIP5 archive. The NARCCAP results also include output from a time-slice, high-resolution global simulation. All regional model output is at half degree resolution, whereas the CMIP5 resolutions vary but are coarser than the regional model resolutions. The combined analysis allows us to assess added value of finer resolution in simulating extreme precipitation. Analysis focuses on selected regions of North America for winter (DJF) and summer (JJA), building on several previous analyses focused on this region. In addition to comparing results from the different models, we also compare simulated precipitation and supporting processes with those obtained from observed precipitation and reanalysis atmospheric states.\nIn the central U.S., the models generally reproduce well the precipitation-vs.-intensity spectrum seen in observations, with a tendency for coarse-resolution global models to produce somewhat less intense precipitation. In contrast, all models are deficient in high intensity precipitation in Alaska. Further analysis focuses on precipitation events exceeding the 99.5 percentile that occur simultaneously at several points in the region, yielding so-called “widespread events”. Analysis of 500 hPa heights, near-surface circulation and fields such as temperature and humidity reveal the processes leading to extreme events in the models and observations. The finer resolution models generally reproduce the physical behavior of these extreme events, with the coarser models showing a smoother rendition. In the central U.S., for winter, these events are produced by slowly moving low-pressure systems that all models simulate fairly well. In Alaska, these events tend to occur through orographic uplift in both observations and simulations. This difference in physical behavior between the two regions suggests reasons for the deficiency in Alaska’s simulated, high intensity precipitation.",

The rate of mobile-regolith production and its residence time on hillslopes shapes the topography and evolution of hillslopes. We calculate the production rate of mobile regolith and the mobile-regolith residence times on active hillslopes in Gordon Gulch, within the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), Colorado. We find mobile-regolith production rates (average 3.1 cm/ka) and residence times (average 10-20 ka) derived from both in situand meteoric methods agree. Lowering-rates derived from our study are also comparable to basin-averaged denudation rates for small basins in the Colorado Front Range (Dethier and Lazarus, 2006).\nIn this study, we have measured both in situ and meteoric 10Be in saprolite and mobile regolith separately. We find that, on average, two-thirds of in situ 10Be is produced within saprolite, and that at least one-tenth of the meteoric 10Be inventories are stored in saprolite. In the case of in situ 10Be, this simply reflects the exponential fall-off in production rates through a thin mobile-regolith cover. In the case of meteoric 10Be, our calculations suggest that >40% of the meteoric 10Be deposition occurs within the saprolite. Most studies that utilize 10Be report residence times and soil-production rates based on concentrations in either the mobile regolith or saprolite; therefore, our 10Be data highlight the importance of clearly identifying mobile and immobile portions of the regolith, constraining its 10Be inventory, and use of consistent terminology for the mobile-layer.",

Such a calibration method poses a unique problem since errors related to over-fitting, poor gauging data and uncertain physical connection are passed downstream. Reach-by-reach calibration, while efficient, cannot compensate for limited/poor calibration data of some gauges. To overcome the limitations of reach-by-reach calibration, a system calibration approach is proposed in which all the river reaches within a river basin are calibrated together using a global objective function for all stream flow gauges. In this approach, relative weights can be assigned in the global objective function for different gauges based on the magnitude and quality of available data. The system calibration approach was implemented in a river network covering 11 stream flow gauges within Murrumbidgee catchment (Australia). This study optimises flow at the selected gauges within the river network simultaneously (36 calibrated parameters) utilising a process-based semi-distributed river system model. The model includes processes such as routing, localised runoff, irrigation diversion, overbank flow and losses to groundwater. Goodness of fit is evaluated at the 11 gauges and a flow based weighting scheme is employed to find posterior distributions of parameters using an Approximate Bayesian Computation. The method is evaluated against a reach-by-reach calibration scheme. The comparison shows that the system calibration approach provides an overall improved goodness-of-fit by systematically de-valuing poor quality gauges providing an overall improved basin-wide performance. Clusters of viable parameter sets are determined from the posterior distributions and each examined to assess the effects of parameter uncertainty on internal model states. Such a method of calibration provides a lot more flexibility in the calibration process, however because of the equifinality problem; it has increased potential to allow the model to produce unrealistic model states. The use of supplementary data (flood extent) is tested as a means of reducing parameter uncertainty, and producing more realistic model states.",

Here we review techniques and methodologies used to measure sound velocities in metals at Mbar pressures, with specific focus on the compressional sound velocity of hexagonal close-packed iron. A critical comparison of literature results, coherently analyzed using the same metrology (pressure scale, equation of state,), allowed us to propose reference relations for the pressure and density evolution of the compressional velocity of hexagonal close-packed iron at ambient temperature. This provides a key base line upon which build on complexity, including high-temperature effects, pre-melting effects, effects of nickel and/or light element inclusion, necessary for an accurate comparison with seismic models, and ultimately to constrain Earth’s inner core composition.",

            "abstract": "Integrated modelling and assessment (IMA) is best regarded as a process that can support environmental decision-making when issues are strongly contested and uncertainties pervasive. To be most useful, the process must be multi-dimensional and phased. Principally, it must be tailored to the problem context to encompass diverse issues of concern, management settings and stakeholders. This in turn requires the integration of multiple processes and components of natural and human systems and their corresponding spatial and temporal scales. Modellers therefore need to be able to integrate multiple disciplines, methods, models, tools and data, and many sources and types of uncertainty. These dimensions are incorporated into iteration between the various phases of the IMA process, including scoping, problem framing and formulation, assessing options and communicating findings. Two case studies in Australia are employed to share the lessons of how integration can be achieved in these IMA phases using a mix of stakeholder participation processes and modelling tools. One case study aims to improve the relevance of modelling by incorporating stakeholder’s views of irrigated viticulture and water management decision making. It used a novel methodology with the acronym ICTAM, consisting of Interviews to elicit mental models, Cognitive maps to represent and analyse individual and group mental models, Time-sequence diagrams to chronologically structure the decision making process, an All-encompassing conceptual model, and computational Models of stakeholder decision making. The second case uses a hydro-economic river network model to examine basin-wide impacts of water allocation cuts and adoption of farm innovations. The knowledge exchange approach used in each case was designed to integrate data and knowledge bearing in mind the contextual dimensions of the problem at hand, and the specific contributions that environmental modelling was thought to be able to make.",

            "abstract": "Slip along subduction megathrusts generally ranges from seismogenic, to slow slip events (SSE) and aseismic creep. Although temperature and clay mineralogy are widely believed to play key roles in governing modes of slip, little is known about the microphysical mechanisms controlling this diverse behaviour, and laboratory friction data for realistic materials at in-situ conditions are few. Recently, we have published a series of large strain, rotary shear experiments on synthetic gouges consisting of phyllosilicates and quartz, sheared at in-situ PT conditions and low sliding velocities V (1-100 µm/s) relevant to earthquake nucleation. Here, we report new results for natural megathrust materials exhumed from different depths on Shikoku, SW Japan. These natural gouges were deformed at sample-specific, peak in-situ PT conditions with fluid overpressure ratios λ between 0.4 and 0.9, and V=0.1-100 µm/s. The simulated and natural materials show broadly consistent behaviour with rate strengthening [(a-b)>0] at T<~200-300°C (Regime 1), rate weakening [(a-b)<0] that would potentially allow nucleation of unstable slip at T up to ~400-500°C (Regime 2) and again rate strengthening at T>~500° C (Regime 3). These observations suggest the potential for earthquake nucleation in Regime 2. In addition, (a-b) tends to become more positive with increasing λ and with increasing V up to ~200-300°C, suggesting possible SSE nucleation in Regime 1, where high λ values have a stabilizing effect. These observations can be explained by a quantitative microphysical model for the steady state frictional behaviour of illite-quartz gouges, which includes rate independent slip on phyllosilicates and time dependent pressure solution of quartz clasts.",

            "abstract": "Due to global climate change, tropical forest, savanna, and grassland biomes, and the transitions between them, are expected to undergo major changes in the future. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are largely used to understand vegetation dynamics under present climate, and to predict its changes under future conditions. However, several DGVMs display high uncertainty in predicting vegetation in tropical areas. Here we present the results of a comparative analysis of three different DGVMs (JSBACH, LPJ-GUESS-SPITFIRE and aDGVM) with regard to their different representations of the ecological mechanisms and feedbacks that determine the forest, savanna and grassland biomes, in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap between ecology and global modelling. We compared model outcomes to observed tree cover along a mean annual precipitation gradient in Africa. Through these comparisons, and by drawing on the large number of recent studies that have delivered new insights into the ecology of tropical ecosystems in general, and of savannas in particular, we identify two main mechanisms that need an improved representation in the DGVMs. The first mechanism encompasses water limitation to tree growth, and tree-grass competition for water, which are key factors in determining savanna occurrence in arid and semi-arid areas. The second is a grass-fire feedback, which maintains both forest and savannas in mesic areas. Grasses constitute the majority of the fuel load, and at the same time benefit from the openness of the landscape after fires, since they recover faster than trees. Additionally, these two mechanisms are better represented when the models also include tree life stages (adults and seedlings), and distinguish between fire-prone and shade-tolerant savanna trees, and fire-resistant and shade-intolerant forest trees. Including these basic elements could improve the predictive ability of the DGVMs, not only under current climate conditions but also and especially under future scenarios.",

Among a number of emerging space-based remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) seems the most promising for important innovation in landslide and subsidence hazards assessment and monitoring. MTI is appealing to those concerned with terrain instability hazards because it can provide very precise information on slow displacements of the ground surface over vast areas with limited vegetation cover. Although MTI techniques are considered to have already reached the operational level, it is apparent that in both research and practice we are at present only beginning to benefit from the high-resolution imagery that is currently acquired by the new generation radar satellites (e.g. COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X). In this overview we illustrate the great potential of high resolution MTI and explain what this technique can deliver in terms of detection and monitoring of slope and subsidence hazards. This is done by considering different areas characterized by a wide range of geomorphic, climatic and vegetation conditions, and presenting selected case study examples of local to regional scale MTI applications from Europe, China and Haiti. We envision that the current approach to assessment of hazard can be transformed by capitalizing more on the presently underexploited advantage of the MTI technique, i.e. the capability to provide regularly spatially-dense quantitative information for large areas currently unaffected by instabilities, but where the terrain geomorphology and geology may indicate potential for future ground failures.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the links between climate and water cycle is essential in the current context of global warming. The water isotopic composition, quantified as δD, δ18O or δ17O, has a great potential to trace the organization of present-day hydrological cycle. When recorded in various archives as tree rings, sediments, ice cores, they have also been largely used to reconstruct the past evolution of climate and water.\nThe Antarctic cap is extremely sensitive to climate change. Moreover, this region is under the influence of exchanges between the troposphere and the stratosphere because of the presence of the polar vortex. Tritium (3H) has been shown to be an appropriate tracer for the intrusion of stratospheric air masses into the lower troposphere. Natural tritium is mainly produced by the interaction of cosmic radiations with the upper atmosphere. This tritium enters the hydrological cycle in the form of tritiated water molecules (HTO) and has a radioactive half-life of 4500±8 days.\nIn an approach combining data and model, we have first implemented tritium in the coupled Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique Zoom (LMDZ) Atmospheric General Circulation Model developed at IPSL [Risi et al., 2010]: LMDZ-iso. The implementation of natural tritium uses the same model architecture as for the other water isotopes, after a correct description of associated cosmogenic production terms [Masarik and Beer, 2009]. The model is used in a configuration dedicated to the simulation of the stratosphere, with 39 layers.\nIn this presentation, we will focus on the modeling of spatial and temporal natural variations of tritium content in precipitation. The model is validated against a compilation of available data for natural tritium. We show that the continental and latitudinal effects are well reproduced by the model and that simulated seasonal variations of the tritium content of precipitation are coherent with our current knowledge of troposphere-stratosphere exchanges.\nMasarik and Beer (2009) J.

Geophys., 31, 1227–1240, 2013).\nWe perform numerical experiments, changing the total voltage between the ionosphere and the equatorial magnetosphere during the course of the simulation. In the initial state, the total acceleration voltage is 3 kV and there is a double layer approximately 5000 km above the ionospheric end of the system. When the voltage is increased, electrons are trapped between the double layer and the magnetic mirror in a region of velocity space that initially was empty. When the voltage is decreased to its initial value these trapped electrons are released upwards. If the voltage is lowered first and then raised back to where it started, the newly trapped electrons remain trapped. As a consequence of the difference between the two cases, the electron pitch angle distribution, below the double layer, carries information about the recent history of the acceleration voltage. In both cases, most of the change in voltage, ΔV, is assumed by the double layer, in agreement with a study of Cluster data that could confine most of ΔV to altitudes below the spacecraft (Forsyth et al., JGR, 117, A12203, 2012). Hysteresis effects in the double layer position are seen in connection with the electron trapping.\nThis work was supported by the Belgian Science Policy Office through the Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence and by PRODEX/Cluster contract 13127/98/NL/VJ(IC)-PEA 90316.",

Since this is the case of most minerals of the upper mantle (olivine, pyroxene, …), we anticipate that, besides dislocation creep that is responsible for the development of strongly pronounced lattice preferred orientations, other deformation mechanisms such as diffusion, grain boundary sliding, disclinations, … must be active in-situ. It has been established that such an accommodation mechanism completely controls the effective flow stress of the mantle rock. In this presentation, using a scale transition model that allows relating polycrystal and grain behaviors, we will show that they also have a huge influence of the effective stress sensitivity (stress exponent). For example if one consider that n=3.5 as for the slip of dislocation in individual grains, one cannot reach the commonly adopted value n=3.5 at the polycrystal scale, if the accommodation mechanism is linear (n=1) as for e.g. diffusion creep. This raises the question about possible deformation mechanisms active in-situ.",

            "abstract": "The nature of how anaerobic microbes have come to distribute themselves within Earth’s crust is an ecologic question that must be posed subject to the laws of thermodynamics, but a question that cannot be understood in light of thermodynamics alone. We use here the results of theory and quantitative modeling, field observations, and long-term laboratory experiments to argue that subsurface communities are composed of groups of microbes that cooperate as well as compete, and whose existence reflects a tight balance between reproduction and cell death.\nThe most significant functional groups colonizing the anoxic crust, classified by electron accepting process, are the methanogens, sulfate reducers, and ferric iron reducers. An anaerobe can harvest the energy it needs to live and reproduce only to the extent that energy available to it in the environment exceeds the cell’s internal levels. When methanogens transfer or dismutate electrons, they capture little energy, so as to preserve a thermodynamic drive for their catabolic reaction. In this way, they maximize their environmental range, but grow slowly. Sulfate reducers adopt a different strategy, striving to capture energy quickly and grow rapidly. Iron reduction consumes acid, so the energy available to iron reducers varies sharply with pH. The iron reducers can grow rapidly under acidic conditions, but an alkaline environment may leave them insufficient energy to live.\nMethane producers are vulnerable to exclusion in the subsurface, as is broadly appreciated, but not because of energetic limitations. Instead, the methanogens require abundant energy substrates in order to reproduce quickly enough to replace cells as they die. Sulfate reducers and iron reducers, instead of working to exclude each other by competing for limited energy sources, as is commonly believed, thrive in mutualistic communities. The three functional groups by necessity compete in their environments for limited sources of energy, but the manner in which the groups have come to colonize the subsurface is richer and more nuanced than can be explained by competition alone.",

            "abstract": "InSAR-based measurement of ground subsidence rates are notoriously challenging in agricultural areas because of rapid temporal decorrelation introduced by physical disturbance of the ground and water content changes. This can be mitigated by the use of longer wavelength instruments and time series techniques, but measurement remains a challenge particularly in areas where the deformation rates are low. Here we discuss techniques developed to work with low coherence data in a project to measure sub-island scale subsidence rates across the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta using SBAS processing of L-band UAVSAR data collected between July 2009 and February 2014. Determination of rates in this area is particularly valuable because of the Delta’s critical importance as a water resource for the State of California and as an enormously productive estuarine ecosystem. Subsidence across the region has left most of the man-made islands below mean sea level and the levees maintaining their integrity are subject to a wide range of threats, including failure during earthquakes on the nearby Hayward and San Andreas fault.\nThis research was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "Helium and CO2 isotope compositions and CO2/3He ratios of Turkish geothermal fluids from various neotectonic provinces suggest genetic relationships with magmatic and tectonic activities. The provinces include western and eastern Anatolia, experiencing extensional and compressional regimes, respectively, and the North Turkish province experiencing strike-slip tectonics associated with the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ). He-isotope compositions display a range of values from 0.27-1.67 Ra for western Anatolia, 0.85-7.76 Ra for eastern Anatolia, and 0.28-2.19 Ra for NAFZ fluids, with δ13C values between -8.04 and +0.35 ‰, -14.59 and +1.30 ‰ , and -1.92 and +1.52‰ , respectively. CO2/3He ratios lie between 1.66x109-2.35x1013, 2.4x105-3.7x1013and 32x109-26x1013for the fluids of western and eastern Anatolia and the NAFZ, respectively. Combined He-CO2 systematics suggest that degassing and preferential CO2 loss significantly affects some samples resulting in the fractionation of elemental CO2/He ratios.Quantitative assessment of the volatile inventory suggests ~97% and 10% mantle-derived component in the He- and C-inventories, the C-budget being dominated by carbonate contributions in agreement with the composition of basement metamorphics (containing marble) and reservoir lithologies (marble, limestone) in most fields. The highest mantle-He contribution, accompanied by the highest mantle-C, is recorded in eastern Anatolia in the vicinity of the most recently-active Nemrut volcano. Relatively high mantle-He and mantle-C contributions in the Tuzla field of western Anatolia display close spatial association with young, alkaline volcanics. Along the NAFZ, the highest mantle contributions are recorded at the most seismically-active western-central segment. Collectively, these observations suggest the addition of mantle volatiles to crust by young magmatic activities and their transfer to the surface via fault zones of these tectonic provinces.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude regions are experiencing rapid and extensive changes in ecosystem composition and function as the result of increases in average air temperature. Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost, which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Further warming could lead to increasing ground temperatures, thickening active-layers, and accelerated thawing and degradation of permafrost. Despite permafrost’s influence on ecosystem structure and functions, relatively little has been done to quantify permafrost properties across extremely large areas and at high resolutions. Detection and mapping of permafrost are difficult, however, because it is a subsurface condition of the ground, heterogeneous in nature, and largely exists in remote locations. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map permafrost through empirical modeling approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated high-resolution (30-m pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1 m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout most of Alaska. Our calibrated models were then used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) may be measured by mass balance methods and estimated by flux sensing methods. The mass balance methods are typically restricted in terms of the area that can be represented (e.g., surface area of weighing lysimeter (LYS) or equivalent representative area of neutron probe (NP) and soil core sampling techniques), and can be biased with respect to ET from the surrounding area. The area represented by flux sensing methods such as eddy covariance (EC) is typically estimated with a flux footprint/source area model. The dimension, position of, and relative contribution of upwind areas within the source area are mainly influenced by sensor height, wind speed, atmospheric stability and wind direction. Footprints for EC sensors positioned several meters above the canopy are often larger than can be economically covered by mass balance methods. Moreover, footprints move with atmospheric conditions and wind direction to cover different field areas over time while mass balance methods are static in space. Thus, EC systems typically sample a much greater field area over time compared with mass balance methods. Spatial variability of surface cover can thus complicate interpretation of flux estimates from EC systems. The most commonly used flux estimation method is EC; and EC estimates of latent heat energy (representing ET) and sensible heat fluxes combined are typically smaller than the available energy from net radiation and soil heat flux (commonly referred to as lack of energy balance closure). Reasons for this are the subject of ongoing research. We compare ET from LYS, NP and EC methods applied to field crops for three years at Bushland, Texas (35° 11’ N, 102° 06’ W, 1170 m elevation above MSL) to illustrate the potential problems with and comparative advantages of all three methods. In particular, we examine how networks of neutron probe access tubes can be representative of field areas large enough to be equivalent in size to EC footprints, and how the ET data from these methods can address bias and accuracy issues.",

            "abstract": "Root water uptake (RWU) affects underground water dynamics, with consequences on plant water availability and groundwater recharge. Even though hydrological and climate models are sensitive to RWU parameters, no consensus exists on the modelling of this process. Back in the 1940ies, Van Den Honert’s catenary approach was the first to investigate the use of connected hydraulic resistances to describe water flow in whole plants. However concerns such as the necessary computing when architectures get complex made this approach premature.\nNow that computing power increased dramatically, hydraulic RWU models are gaining popularity, notably because they naturally produce observed processes like compensatory RWU and hydraulic redistribution. Yet major concerns remain. Some are more fundamental: according to hydraulic principles, plant water potential should equilibrate with soil water potential when the plant does not transpire, which is not a general observation when using current definitions of bulk or average soil water potential. Other concerns regard the validation process: water uptake distribution is not directly measurable, which makes it hard to demonstrate whether or not hydraulic models are more accurate than other models. Eventually parameterization concerns exist: root hydraulic properties are not easily measurable, and would even fluctuate on an hourly basis due to processes like aquaporin gating.\nWhile offering opportunities to validate hydraulic RWU models, newly developed observation techniques also make us realize the increasing complexity of processes involved in soil-plant hydrodynamics, such as the change of rhizosphere hydraulic properties with soil drying. Surprisingly, once implemented into hydraulic models, these processes do not necessarily translate into more complex emerging behavior at plant scale, and might justify the use of simplified representations of the soil-plant hydraulic system.",

            "abstract": "Modern topsoils, as well as many paleosols, display enhanced induced magnetizations compared to their parent materials. Such enhanced magnetism has been successfully correlated with local Mean Annual Rainfall (MAR), but a generally applicable deduction of MAR from magnetic properties remains difficult to establish. In fact, there are enough cases of observed departures from the above model to warrant a number of provisos that require knowledge of variability in parent material character, precipitation minus evaporation, and perhaps other local data. Another problem is that we lack the knowledge to construct a forward model that proceeds from fundamental parameters like mineralogy, particle size, non-stoichiometry and structural defects. Increasing knowledge about iron oxide, oxyhydroxide and sulfide nanoparticles, likely first stages of parent material alteration, should help in constructing competing forward models as defined above.\nIn this talk we try to learn from observed magnetic behavior of fully characterized synthetic ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite, their alteration to second phases such as goethite, magnetite, maghemite and hematite, as well as further alterations of some secondary phases to more stable ones. We find that the multiple pathways of alteration depend on structural order, impurities, non-stoichiometry and kinetic stability of end products. By ranking the effects of these parameters, we can try to modify current forward models of alteration based on thermodynamic stability of iron oxides in parent materials. The ultimate goal should be to determine degrees of confidence in our claims of past climatic or environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Climate variability has been associated with a range of societal and individual outcomes including migration, violent conflict, changes in labor productivity, and health impacts. Some of these may be direct responses to changes in mean temperature or precipitation or extreme events, such as displacement of human populations by tropical cyclones. Others may be mediated by a variety of biological, social, or ecological factors such as migration in response to long-term changes in crops yields. Research is beginning to elucidate and distinguish the many channels through which climate variability may influence human behavior (ranging from the individual to the collective, societal level) in order to better understand how to improve resilience in the face of current variability as well as future climate change. Using a variety of data sets from South Africa, we show how climate variability has influenced internal (within country) migration in recent history. We focus on South Africa as it is a country with high levels of internal migration and dramatic temperature and precipitation changes projected for the 21st century. High poverty rates and significant levels of rain-fed, smallholder agriculture leave large portions of South Africa’s population base vulnerable to future climate change. In this study, we utilize two complementary statistical models - one micro-level model, driven by individual and household level survey data, and one macro-level model, driven by national census statistics. In both models, we consider the effect of climate on migration both directly (with gridded climate reanalysis data) and indirectly (with agricultural production statistics). With our historical analyses of climate variability, we gain insights into how the migration decisions of South Africans may be influenced by future climate change. We also offer perspective on the utility of micro and macro level approaches in the study of climate change and human migration.",

Developing a good, mechanistic understanding of halogen activation chemistry – and particularly its pH dependence – requires knowledge of surface pH. Here we described the development and use of a surface-sensitive spectroscopic approach to investigate pH at frozen surfaces. The approach, which involves glancing-angle laser-induced fluorescence in conjunction with pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes (acridine and harmine), was used to study pH at frozen surfaces following the deposition of gas phase acids or bases. We demonstrate that frozen ‘pure water’ and frozen ‘salt water’ surfaces exhibit different responses. The responses are consistent with the presence of a chemically unique, disordered region at the frozen ‘pure water’ surface and the presence of liquid brine at the frozen ‘salt water’ surface. Significantly, we show that a frozen sea water surface is resistant to changes in pH, suggesting that some buffering capacity is maintained upon freezing. Finally the pH dependence of bromine and chlorine activation from artificial saline snow is presented. Bromine release is found to depend less strongly on pre-freezing snow pH, but the release of both species is favoured for low pre-freezing pH values. In the context of these pH and halogen activation studies, the potential importance of various frozen sea ice substrates for promoting halogen activation chemistry will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The spectral turbulence model of Lorenz, as modified for surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics by Rotunno and Snyder, is further modified to more smoothly approach nonlinear saturation. This model is used to investigate error growth starting from different distributions of the initial error. Consistent with an often overlooked finding by Lorenz, the loss of predictability generated by initial errors of small but fixed absolute magnitude is essentially independent of their spatial scale when the background saturation kinetic energy spectrum is proportional the -5/3 power of the wavenumber. Thus, because the background kinetic energy increases with scale, very small relative errors at long wavelengths have similar impacts on perturbation error growth as large relative errors at short wavelengths. To the extent that this model applies to practical meteorological forecasts, the influence of initial perturbations generated by butterflies would be swamped by unavoidable tiny relative errors in the large scales.\nThe rough applicability of our modified spectral turbulence model to the atmosphere over scales ranging between 10 km and 1000 km is supported by the good estimate it provides for the ensemble error growth in state-of-the-art ensemble mesoscale-model simulations of two winter storms. The initial error spectrum for the ensemble perturbations in these cases has maximum power at the longest wavelengths. The dominance of large-scale errors in the ensemble suggests that mesoscale weather forecasts may often be limited by errors arising from the large-scales instead of being produced solely through an upscale cascade from the smallest scales. These results imply the predictability of small-scale features in the vicinity of topography may be shorter than currently supposed.",

            "abstract": "The lower Paleozoic Elk Creek carbonatite is a 6-8 kilometer diameter intrusive complex buried under 200 meters of sedimentary rocks in southeastern Nebraska. It hosts the largest known niobium deposit in the U.S. and a rare earth element (REE) deposit. The carbonatite is composed of several lithologies, the relations of which are poorly understood. Niobium mineralization is most enriched within a magnetite beforsite unit, and REE oxides are concentrated in a barite beforsite unit. The carbonatite intrudes Proterozoic country rocks. A high-resolution airborne gravity gradient and magnetic survey was flown over the carbonatite in 2012. The carbonatite is associated with an annular vertical gravity gradient high with a subdued central low, and a central magnetic high surrounded by magnetic field values lower than those over the country rocks. Geophysical, borehole, and physical property data are combined for an interpretation of these signatures. The carbonatite is denser than the country rocks, explaining the gravity gradient high. Most carbonatite lithologies have weaker magnetic susceptibilities than those of the country rocks, explaining why the carbonatite produces a magnetic low at its margin. The primary source of the central magnetic high is interpreted to be mafic rocks that are strongly magnetized and are present in large volumes. Magnetite beforsite is very dense (mean density 3200 kg/m3) and strongly magnetized (median 0.073 SI magnetic susceptibility), producing a gravity gradient high and contributing to the aeromagnetic high. Barite beforsite has physical properties similar to most of the carbonatite volume, making it a poor geophysical target. Geophysical anomalies indicate the presence of dense and strongly magnetized rocks at depths below existing boreholes, either a large volume of magnetite beforsite or another unknown lithology. Studies are underway to investigate possible effects of alteration and magnetic remanence, and to better constrain the 3D distribution of magnetite beforsite.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane Katrina destroyed more than 200,000 homes and led to massive economic and physical dislocation. Using a panel of tax return data, we provide one of the first comprehensive analyses of the hurricane’s long-term economic impact on its victims. We find small and mostly transitory impacts of the disaster on wages, employment, and total income, even among the worst affected. Remarkably, within a few years, Katrina victims have higher incomes than controls from similar cities that were unaffected by the storm. Withdrawals from retirement accounts offset some of the temporary fall in wages. Finally, there is a short-run spike in marriage and little impact on either divorce or child bearing. These findings suggest that, at least in developed countries like the United States, dislocation is unlikely to be an important component of the social or economic costs of dramatic negative events, such as natural disasters or climate change.",

            "abstract": "Applying diffusion models to chemical transects collected across crystal sections is progressively becoming an essential utensil of the earth scientist’s toolbox to extract timescales of magmatic or metamorphic processes. The extent to which the crystal morphology in 3D space, the style of zoning (i.e. normal, reverse. Core-rim), the anisotropy of diffusion, and fluxes from the different dimensions affect timescales retrieved from 1D diffusion modeling remains largely unstudied. Here, we examine the influence of crystal shape and zoning style on calculated diffusion times via series of numerical models. Three-dimensional numerical olivines with various habits (spherical, rectangular parallelepiped, and polyhedral) were built and left to diffuse at magmatic temperatures for various durations. To cover a range of potentially magma mixing and crystallization scenarios, the simulations tested six forsterite zoning configurations. We show that even when diffusion anisotropy is corrected for in 1D models, timescales can still vary between 0.2‒10 times the true 3D diffusion time due to crystal shape and sectioning effects. Zoning style is found to only have a significant influence in the case of core-rim zoning configurations. Most of the problems associated with crystal shape and sectioning cannot be corrected empirically, but we highlight how they can be averted by using careful grain selection procedures.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern Lau Spreading Center exhibits variations in mantle source composition, melt supply, and crustal characteristics consistent with a decreasing influence of slab volatiles on mantle melting with distance from the active Tofua arc. A series of recent geophysical and geochemical studies show that over the past 4 Myr the spreading center has formed distinct zones of oceanic crust as the ridge migrates away from the arc and its underlying mantle melting region. Recent seismic tomographic images reveal that a fundamentally distinct type of oceanic crust forms along back-arc spreading centers located near (<50 km) the active arc. This crust is anomalously thick (8–9 km) and seismically layered, and by inference chemically differentiated, in a manner not observed in crust produced at mid-ocean ridges. Lava samples from this region are enriched in subduction-related components, including water, and have compositions that extend to very low (~1 wt%) MgO contents, indicating erupted lavas have experienced considerably more crystal fractionation on average than typical mid-ocean ridge basalts. Further from the arc, crust produced at the spreading center abruptly transitions (within ~5 km) to a more normal thickness (~6 km) and seismic structure as compared to oceanic crust formed at intermediate-rate mid-ocean ridges. Here, lavas primarily consist of less evolved basalts (~6-8+ wt% MgO) with relatively low arc-like enrichments. Our work suggests a model for the formation of arc-proximal, chemically-stratified oceanic crust that is counter to other published interpretations of stratified crust detected in other back-arc systems: water from the downgoing slab is entrained in the melting zone beneath the ridges where it enhances melting and crustal production. Thereafter, water in the primary magmas suppresses plagioclase crystallization relative to olivine and clinopyroxene, creating an unusually mafic lower crust; residual low-viscosity melts buoyantly rise upward to form a more felsic, porous upper crust. Testing this model, and advancing our understanding of magmatic processes along water-rich spreading centers, is a primary focus of future research.",

            "abstract": "Biodegradation of continuously emitted plumes is known to be most pronounced at the plume fringe, where mixing of contaminated water and ambient groundwater, containing dissolved electron acceptors, stimulates microbial activity. Under steady-state conditions, physical mixing of contaminant and electron acceptor by transverse dispersion was shown to be the major bottleneck for biodegradation, with plume lengths scaling inversely with the bulk transverse dispersivity in quasi two-dimensional settings. Under these conditions, the presence of suitable microbes is essential but the biokinetic parameters do not play an important role. When the location of the plume shifts (caused, e.g., by a fluctuating groundwater table), however, the bacteria are no more situated at the plume fringe and biomass growth, decay, activation and deactivation determine the time lag until the fringe-controlled steady state is approached again. During this time lag, degradation is incomplete. The objective of the presented study was to analyze to which extent flow and transport dynamics diminish effectiveness of fringe-controlled biodegradation and which microbial processes and related biokinetic parameters determine the system response in overall degradation to hydraulic fluctuations.\nWe performed experiments in quasi-two-dimensional flow through microcosms on aerobic toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1. Plume dynamics were simulated by vertical alteration of the toluene plume position and experimental results were analyzed by reactive-transport modeling. We found that, even after disappearance of the toluene plume for two weeks, the majority of microorganisms stayed attached to the sediment and regained their full biodegradation potential within two days after reappearance of the toluene plume. Our results underline that besides microbial growth and maintenance (often subsumed as \"biomass decay\") microbial dormancy (that is, change into a metabolically inactive state) and endogeneous respiration are important to understand the dynamic behavior of electron-acceptor and -donor fluxes under transient environmental conditions and therefore deserve increased consideration in future reactive-transport modeling.",

            "abstract": "ARIA is a joint JPL/Caltech project to automate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GPS imaging capabilities for scientific understanding, hazard response, and societal benefit. We have built a prototype SAR and GPS data system that forms the foundation for hazard monitoring and response capability, as well as providing imaging capabilities important for science studies. Together, InSAR and GPS have the ability to capture surface deformation in high spatial and temporal resolution. For earthquakes, this deformation provides information that is complementary to seismic data on location, geometry and magnitude of earthquakes. Accurate location information is critical for understanding the regions affected by damaging shaking. Regular surface deformation measurements from SAR and GPS are useful for monitoring changes related to many processes that are important for hazard and resource management such as volcanic deformation, groundwater withdrawal, and landsliding.\nObservations of SAR coherence change have a demonstrated use for damage assessment for hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions. These damage assessment maps can be made from imagery taken day or night and are not affected by clouds, making them valuable complements to optical imagery. The coherence change caused by the damage from hazards (building collapse, flooding, ash fall) is also detectable with intelligent algorithms, allowing for rapid generation of damage assessment maps over large areas at fine resolution, down to the spatial scale of single family homes.\nWe will present the progress and results we have made on automating the analysis of SAR data for hazard monitoring and response using data from the Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed constellation of X-band SAR satellites. Since the beginning of our project with ASI, our team has imaged deformation and coherence change caused by many natural hazard events around the world. We will present progress on our data system technology that enables rapid and reliable production of imagery. Lastly, we participated in the March 2014 FEMA exercise based on a repeat of the 1964 M9.2 Alaska earthquake, providing simulated data products for use in this hazards response exercise. We will present lessons learned from this and other simulation exercises.",

            "abstract": "We present a case study of the 7 January 2014 event in order to highlight current challenges in space weather forecasting of CME arrival time and geomagnetic storm strength. On 7 January 2014 an X1.2 flare and CME with a radial speed ~2400 km/s was observed from active region 11943. The flaring region was only ten degrees southwest of disk center with extensive dimming south of the active region and preliminary analysis indicated a fairly rapid arrival at Earth (~36 hours). Of the eleven forecasting groups world-wide who participated in CCMC's Space Weather Scoreboard (http://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/SWScoreBoard), nine predicted early arrivals and six predicted dramatic geomagnetic storm impacts (Kp predictions ranged from 6 to 9). However, the CME only had a glancing blow arrival at Earth - Kp did not rise above 3 and there was no geomagnetic storm. What happened? One idea is that the large coronal hole to the northeast of the active region could have deflected the CME. This coronal hole produced a high speed stream near Earth reaching an uncommon speed of 900 km/s four days after the observed CME arrival. However, no clear CME deflection was observed in the outer coronagraph fields of view (~5-20Rs) where CME measurements are derived to initiate models, therefore deflection seems unlikely. Another idea is the effect of the CME flux rope orientation with respect to Earth orbit. We show that using elliptical major and minor axis widths obtained by GCS fitting for the initial CME parameters in ENLIL would have improved the forecast to better reflect the observed glancing blow in-situ signature. We also explore the WSA-ENLIL+Cone simulations, the background solar wind solution, and compare with the observed CME arrival at Venus (from Venus Express) and Earth.",

            "abstract": "Solutes in snow and ice are present in at least 3 different types of locations: at the air-ice interface (sometimes called the quasi-liquid layer or QLL), in other liquid-like regions (LLRs) within the ice, and in the matrix of the bulk ice. Some reports in the literature show that direct photodegradation of solutes is enhanced in the QLL relative to in solution, while other reports show that solutes in whole ice samples behave as if they were in supercooled aqueous solution. Our overall goal is to understand where solutes reside in laboratory ice samples and whether their photochemistry depends upon location. In this first portion of our work we will describe our efforts to address the first component of this goal, i.e., the location of solutes.\nUsing micro-CT (computed tomography) we can create a 3-dimensional image of a frozen sample, identifying areas of air, water ice, and concentrated solute. Slower freezing methods tend to produce samples with larger air bubbles and concentrated solute inclusions. Interestingly, areas of concentrated solute are often adjacent to internal air bubbles, providing an air-ice interface that is not at the top surface of the sample. We also see some concentrated solute in internal veins or at the ice-air interface at the top of the sample. These areas have some liquid-like behavior, often forming thin layers and moving within the frozen sample in a thermal gradient (but still below 273 K). In contrast, for samples prepared by flash-freezing solution in liquid nitrogen, the solutes are nearly invisible to the micro-CT technique, suggesting they are present in very small domains, possibly dispersed throughout the sample.",

            "abstract": "For decades, forest and water managers have been investigating how forest management (e.g., through strategic thinning or gap cutting) can increase snow retention and help water resources. Predictions of warming temperatures and decreasing snowpacks have renewed interest in taking such actions, but model results about the combined impact of forest change and temperature change on snow are conflicting. Forest interception processes vary with winter temperatures, due to changes in branch stiffness and in the relative cohesion (stickiness) of snowflakes. Models prescribe forest interception to be some fraction of falling snow (interception efficiency, Ie, see Figure), and the total amount of snow that a canopy can hold (Imax, see Figure). However, interception models developed in colder regions (Hedstrom and Pomeroy 1998) prescribe Imax decreasing with temperature, while those developed in warmer regions (Andreadis et al. 2009) prescribe Imax increasing with temperature (see Figure). Here, we use a modular model framework (SUMMA) to isolate model choices related to interception and test the impact of these choices on modeled snow sensitivity to prescribed climate change (delta-T) and forest change (delta-tree) at study sites in both the Pacific Northwest (warm) and the Boreal forest (cold). Independently calibrating model parameters allows snow modeled with either interception formulation to match observations well in both warm and cold study sites, but these different model configurations, while producing matching snow simulations in the calibration year, lead to different predictions of the snow response to change. We discuss when these differences matter most and how carefully-controlled modeling and coordinated multi-site field observations are required to ensure that we have confidence in our modeled prediction of forest snow response under changing conditions.",

            "abstract": "Of the many processes contributing to long-term sea-level change, little attention has been paid to the basin-scale contributions of salinity-driven halosteric changes. We evaluate simulated against observed estimates of long-term (1950-present) halosteric patterns and compare these to corresponding thermosteric changes. Spatially coherent halosteric patterns are visible in the historical record, and are consistent with estimates of long-term water cycle amplification. Our results suggest that Pacific and Atlantic basin-scale halosteric change contributions are substantially larger than previously assumed, with observed estimates and coupled climate models suggesting magnitudes of ~25% of the corresponding thermosteric changes. In both observations and models Pacific basin-scale freshening leads to a density reduction that augments thermosteric expansion whereas in the Atlantic halosteric changes partially compensate strong thermosteric expansion through a basin-scale enhanced salinity density increase. Although regional differences are apparent, at basin-scales consistency is found between the observed and simulated partitioning of halosteric and thermosteric changes, and suggests that models are simulating the processes driving observed long-term basin-scale sea-level change. Further analysis demonstrates that the observed halosteric changes and their basin partitioning are consistent with CMIP5 simulations that include anthropogenic CO2 forcings (Historical), but are found to be inconsistent with simulations that exclude anthropogenic forcings (HistoricalNat).

The ignimbrites are overwhelming rhyodacitic (plagioclase and hornblende or biotite phyric) or rhyolitic (quartz (+/- sanidine) in additon to plagioclase and hornblende or biotite phyric) and sparsely to highly phyric. Preliminary petrographic (phenocryst abundances) and geochemical (major and trace element) will be presented and compared to existing data from elsewhere in the SMO. Future work will include U-Pb zircon dating and whole rock and in-zircon radiogenic isotopes analyses.",

            "abstract": "Most previous studies on the genesis and evolution of bedforms in large rivers have focused on aggradational bedforms within alluvial sediments, with very few investigations that concern either erosive bedform evolution or bedrock channel abrasion processes. Detailed understanding of the processes within bedrock reaches of river channels is vital if an improved understanding of formation and evolution of bedrock scours and bedforms are to be elucidated. The paper presents high-resolution bathymetry and sidescan derived from multibeam sonar (MBES) and detailed flow mapping by acoustic Doppler current profiling (ADCP) to illustrate, in intricate detail, relations between morphology, flow and sediment transport processes through a bedrock reach of the Mekong River (Cambodia) during a large flood event. A 2 by 5 km reach of the Mekong river near Sambor was surveyed with a RESON 7125 MBES system revealing incredible >40 m scour features within the bedrock substrate, with sidescan imagery also revealing the routing of alluvial sediment through the scours. A series of ADCP transects were obtained, both transverse and perpendicular to the primary downstream flow, that map the flows into, around and within these scour features. The paper will conclude by looking at how advances in measurement capability have permitted the detailed processes in such channels to be investigated for the first time at this scale.",

            "abstract": "Global correlations between Al2O3 and Pt/Os in mantle peridotites suggest that Pt behaves incompatibly relative to Os during partial melting [c.f., 1]. Because 190Pt decays to 186Os (t1/2 = 468 Ga), correlations between 186Os/188Os and peridotite fertility can be used to constrain the long-term Pt/Os evolution of the depleted mantle and the initial Pt/Os ratio of the primitive upper mantle (PUM). We examined 186Os/188Os in mantle peridotites from continental (Rio Grande Rift/Colorado Plateau) and oceanic (Lena Trough, Hawaiian Islands) settings that span a wide range in fertility (Al2O3 ~0.67-4.42 %) and 187Os/188Os ratios (0.1138-0.1305). The new data define a narrow range in 186Os/188Os (0.1198338 to 0.1198393, 2 SD~24 ppm), placing constraints on long-term Pt/Os variability in the DMM. 186Os/188Os is broadly correlated with indices of melt depletion including spinel Cr#, clinopyroxene Cr#, and clinopyroxene Yb content, consistent with the inferred relative compatibility of Pt and Os during partial melting. Extrapolation of the alumina-186Os/188Os trend to PUM alumina content (~4.5 wt% Al2O3; [2]) suggests a PUM 186Os/188Os of ~0.1198380±15, similar to the 186Os/188Os of H chondrites (~0.1198398±16; [3]). This 186Os/188Os value is consistent with a PUM Pt/Os of 1.8±0.3, similar to Pt/Os values measured in several classes of chondrites (Carbonaceous ~1.9±0.2, Ordinary ~2.0±0.3 and Enstatite ~1.9±0.2; [3]). Whereas ~84% of peridotites worldwide [excluding low-[Os] samples (<1 ppb Os) that may have been compromised by melt-rock reaction and/or weathering and alteration] with measured Pt/Os ratios have Pt/Os between 0.3 and 3.1 (the range permissible from 186Os/188Os variations for melt extraction from PUM at ~1.5 Ga), only ~36% fall between 1.3 and 2.2 (a narrower range consistent with an older ~4.5 Ga melt depletion age). This suggests that much of the observed Pt/Os variability in mantle peridotites is relatively recent. Close agreement between our inferred Pt/OsPUM with previous estimates inferred from chondrites [3] is consistent with the addition of a chondritic late veneer to explain the HSE abundances in the upper mantle.

            "abstract": "Tracers have always played an essential role in the investigation of hydrologic systems, where water flow pathways cannot be directly observed. The use of tracers in catchment hydrology has been constantly increasing, with countless applications including water travel time estimation and hydrograph separation. Moreover, several high-quality datasets now exist and are publicly available, that enable the systematic use of tracers to improve the process representation of hydrologic models. However, tracer information is integrated over space and time and is best interpreted using a coherent and robust theoretical framework. Here, we propose methods derived from the time-variant theory of travel time distributions to interpret tracer measurements and model catchment functioning under different hydrologic conditions. In such a framework, the population of water particles moving within a catchment is considered as a dynamical system, where individuals move and mix inside a control volume before reaching the sampling point. The variability of flow, storage states and mixing experienced by the catchment are explicitly accounted for, providing rigorous tools for tracer investigation. We present applications to highly monitored watersheds (including Hubbard Brook (USA), Hupsel Brook (NL) and Plynlimon (UK)) that show how the transition between catchment states is mirrored by changes in the ages stored and released by the catchment, causing the chemical composition in the discharge to vary accordingly. This can be used to address a number of environmental problems, such as quantifying the interactions between shallow and deep flow systems and understanding nutrient loading persistence.",

            "abstract": "A wide range of geophysical observations suggest that an active partially molten region (Altiplano Puna Magmatic Body or APMB) lies in the mid-upper crust of the Altiplano Puna Plateau, in the Central Andes, with its upper contact at around 20 km depth. In particular, gravity, magnetotellurics and seismics have helped delineating the overall geometry of this intrusive body, which is approximately 200 km in diameter and could be many kilometers thick. The average melt fraction is poorly constrained, although it has been suggested that it could be rather high, around ~15% or higher. In addition to constraining the general shape of the APMB, its dynamics can in principle be partially accessed through geodetic measurements at the surface. In fact, recent InSAR-related studies have shown a ground deformation rate in the order of centimeter per year, with a central uplifting region, centered roughly around a lava-dome complex type of system, Uturuncu volcano, surrounded by an extensive peripheral zone of subsidence. This wealth of observations has leaded us to propose two different hypotheses to partially explain the inner workings of the APMB: (i) the dynamic deformation of the uplift-subsidence of the surface is explained by the impingement of a buoyant melt-rich blob on the more brittle upper levels of the crust, and; (ii) such surface deformation could be associated to the poroviscous compaction induced by lateral melt transport toward a central region of ascent. Both scenarios are modeled numerically. In principle the two hypotheses could explain the rate and geometry of subsidence under some simplifications. We discuss the consequences of both hypotheses, and entertain the possibility of both processes operating together.",

            "abstract": "There is growing concern that future flood losses and fatalities might increase significantly in many regions of the world because of rapid urbanization in deltas and floodplains, in addition to sea level rise and climate change. To better anticipate long-term trajectories of future flood risk, there is a need to treat floodplains and deltas as fully coupled human-physical systems. Here we propose a novel approach to explore the long-term behavior emerging from the mutual interactions and feedbacks between physical and social systems. The implementation of our modeling framework shows that green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of floodplains, are more resilient to increasing flood frequency than technological societies, which deal with flooding by building levees. Also, we show that when coupled dynamics are accounted for, flood-poor periods could (paradoxically) be more dangerous than flood-rich periods.",

            "abstract": "About 85% of the annual precipitation in southern Vietnam (ca. 8–12°N, 104–110°E) occurs during the southwest monsoon season (June to October). Large-scale equatorial waves like the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) are known to modulate the large-scale convective activity, often indicated by variations in (filtered) satellite-observed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies. The present contribution analyses and quantifies the role of the MJO and CCEWs for rainfall not only in southern and central Vietnam as a whole, but also for smaller climatological sub-regions.\nUsing circum-equatorial NOAA OLR (15°S–15°N), prominent spectral peaks are identified in wavenumber–frequency diagrams along the dispersion curves for the solutions of the shallow water equations. They are interpreted as CCEWs. Meridionally averaged wave-filtered OLR and its time derivatives are used to define phases and amplitudes of CCEWs. This will allow determining active and inactive phases of CCEWs in the vicinity of Vietnam. Eastward propagating deep convection is also related to the 30–90-day MJO. The OLR MJO Index (OMI) is used for the definition of convectively active and inactive phases of the MJO. TRMM 3B42 V7, APHRODITE MA V1101 data, and rain gauge measurements are used to investigate the relation between tropical wave phases and amplitudes and precipitation in southern and central Vietnam and adjacent regions. Results using the OMI are compared with those using the Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) Index.\nThe major findings are: (a) Precipitation amounts in southern Vietnam are higher during convectively active phases of the MJO and CCEWs. The waves differ in terms of their relative importance for rainfall enhancement. (b) For increasing CCEW amplitudes, the difference between area-averaged precipitation during inactive and active phases increases. We provide evidence that precipitation amounts are higher when multiple wave types are in their convectively active phases over the Vietnam region.",

            "abstract": "One of the mission objectives for Swarm is to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere, under the influence of the Sun and Earth's magnetic field. For this purpose, each of the three satellites carries a sensitive three-axis accelerometer, an accurate GPS receiver and a laser retroreflector. The GPS receiver data is used both for calibration of the acceleration data, as well as for precise orbit determination. Validation of the precise orbits with independent satellite laser ranging data confirms that the location of each of the three satellites is known to within 2 cm.\nThe data from both the accelerometer and GPS receiver can be used to derive a data set of thermospheric density along the satellite tracks, in a similar way as has been done using CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE. The acceleration data is combined with information on the satellite attitude from the star cameras, and models of the aerodynamic and radiation pressure forces. When density and drag levels are high enough in the future, possibly data on the neutral wind speed in the satellite's cross-track direction can be derived as well.\nDuring commissioning, it was found that the accelerometer observations are affected by a large number of bias jumps, as well as a much larger than expected sensitivity to variations in on-board temperature. This presentation will provide details on investigations into corrections for these effects, as well as on the quality of the density data resulting from the acceleration measurements from the three Swarm satellites.",

            "abstract": "Pesticides are widely used all over the world whether in agricultural production or in non-agricultural settings. They may pose a potential human health effects and environmental risks due to their physico-chemical properties and their extensive use which is growing every year. Pesticides are found in the atmosphere removed from the target area by volatilization or wind erosion, and carried over long distances. These compounds are partitioned between the gaseous and particulate atmospheric phases. The increasingly used pesticides are semi-volatile compounds which are usually adsorbed on the surface of the atmospheric particles. These pesticides may undergo chemical and photo-chemical transformation. New compounds may then be formed that could be more hazardous than the primary pesticides. The atmospheric fate and lifetime of adsorbed pesticides on particles are controlled by the these (photo)chemical processes. However, there is a lack of kinetic data regarding the pesticides in the particle phase.\nThis current work focuses on the photolytic degradation of commonly used pesticides in particulate phase. It aims at estimating the photolytic rates and thus the lifetimes of pesticides adsorbed on silica particles as a proxy of atmospheric particles. The following eight commonly used pesticides, cyprodinil, deltamethrin, difenoconazole, fipronil, oxadiazon, pendimethalin, permethrin, tetraconazole, were chosen because of their physico-chemical properties. The photolysis rates of tetraconazole and permethrin were extremely slow ≤ 1.2 · 10-6 s-1. The photolysis rates for the other pesticides were determined in the range of: (5.9 ± 0.3) · 10-6 < k < (1.7 ± 0.1) · 10-4 s-1 from slowest to the fastest: pendimethalin < cyprodinil < deltamethrin < difenoconazole < oxadiazon < fipronil. Finally, the identification of the surface products upon light irradiation was performed, using GC-(QqQ)-MS/MS and LC-(Q-IMS-ToF)-MS/MS. The potentially formed gas-phase products during these photolysis processes were followed continuously and on-line by PTR-ToF-MS. We hope that the obtained results from this study will help in the development of future environmental strategies to better understand and control phyto-sanitary product application and human exposure.",

As more than 40% of irrigation water comes from groundwater, groundwater abstraction rates are large and exceed natural recharge rates in many regions of the world, thus leading to groundwater depletion. In this paper we provide an overview of recent research on global groundwater depletion. We start with presenting various estimates of global groundwater depletion, both from flux based as well as volume based methods. We also present estimates of the contribution of non-renewable groundwater to irrigation water consumption and how this contribution developed during the last 50 years. Next, using a flux based method, we provide projections of groundwater depletion for the coming century under various socio-economic and climate scenarios. As groundwater depletion contributes to sea-level rise, we also provide estimates of this contribution from the past as well as for future scenarios. Finally, we show recent results of groundwater level changes and change in river flow as a result of global groundwater abstractions as obtained from a global groundwater flow model.",

            "abstract": "Very few laboratory experiments have been made up to date to understand the influence of emerging angle on measured emissivity spectra of particulate materials. Most of the existing works are based on measurements of flat, solid surfaces (mainly metals) that are not easily usable for the analysis of remote sensing data. We believe that a systematic study on the influence of emerging angle for emissivity and reflectance laboratory spectra of asteroids analogs is of crucial importance for the interpretation of data from future missions to asteroids (among them, NASA OSIRIS-Rex, and JAXA Hayabusa II) and for the modelling of surface properties of minor bodies in general.\nAt the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) of DLR in Berlin we set-up an experiment to measure the emissivity of two asteroid analogs, fine powdered (<25 µm) meteorite Millbillillie and a synthetic enstatite at surface temperature of 373K, with emerging angle (e) from 0° to 60°, with 10° step intervals. Special wedges have been created to incline the samples at the right emission angles: to prevent powder to slipper from the sample cups (always happening for e>30°), the samples have been packed using ethanol. For comparisons, we measured reflectance spectra of the same samples, keeping the incidence angle to the allowed minimum (i=13°) and varying the emerging angle as we did for emissivity measurements. All the data show very small spectral variations up to e=30°, while starting from e=40° the changes in band depth and shape become significant, and increase for each 10° step of increasing emerging angle.",

            "abstract": "Recent work in Lesotho, based on the identification and mapping of freshly-fractured, unweathered angular basalt blocks, shows that lightning, and not water-related freeze-thaw cycles, is the dominant contributor to weathering in low-latitude mountains (Knight & Grab 2014, Geomorphology). Lightning strikes generate a distinctive geomagnetic remanent field due to the strong magnetic pulse associated with lightning discharge. This effect can be identified qualitatively with a compass. Here we confirm this interpretation with the use of total magnetic intensity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The field site is located in the high Drakensberg of eastern Lesotho, southern Africa. The summit studied is ~3350 m asl, comprising a series of Jurassic basalt flows in step-like plateaus separated by steep scarps that demarcate individual flow units. Using a Geometrics Walkmag with built in GPS, we collected detailed total magnetic intensity data on a grid of ~1 m x 1 m in a region ~500 m x 500 m where geomorphologic evidence indicates a high concentration of lightning strikes. In addition we collected over 1500 magnetic susceptibility measurements using a ZH Instruments SM-30 susceptibility meter. The susceptibility data show limited variability (from ~0.001 – 0.02 SI), although the magnetic intensity data show tremendous variation from less than ~20,000 to over ~40,000 nT. The most variable data are closest to the steep scarps, with intensity and variation falling off dramatically in the slope regions. Forward modeling of the susceptibility data demonstrates that the variations in measured susceptibilities cannot be responsible for the magnetic intensity variations. This indicates that strong, lightning-induced remanent magnetization is the cause. Detailed magnetic observations indicate that the most intensely remanently magnetized region is not necessarily where the rock has fractured, indicating that the magnetization process is complicated and likely related to preferential lightning energy transfer along rock microfractures away from the strike location. This study provides conclusive evidence that lightning is a dominant process affecting low-latitude mountains, and that this can be identified using geomagnetic techniques.",

            "abstract": "There seems to be less and less doubt that preferential flow pathways in soils have a profound impact on hydrology by enhancing infiltration rates, reducing the filter function of soils or by enhancing fast subsurface flow in hillslopes. Soil hydrological or catchment models have been developed including the different kind of preferential flow pathways like earthworm like macropores (e.g. earthworm channels), pipes, roots, etc. and they have been successfully applied to make predictions at a range of spatial scales. One of the biggest issue using hydrological models including preferential flow routines is the parameterization. What are the landscape features influencing the occurrence and quantity of specific preferential flow features? Will certain macropres be more probable to occur under forest than under grassland soils? In this study, I will highlight several studies looking at the effect of land-use and landscape features on preferential flow properties and parameters. Several field experiments studied on the one side the properties among topographic locations or vegetation cover, but also at the hydrological functions and hence the relevance of preferential flow pathways. In the second part the soil hydrological model ROGER is introduced, which will further evaluate and predict the relevance of vertical and lateral preferential flow pathways at the plot, hillslope and catchment scale.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is an important greenhouse gas and a global air pollutant originating from photo-chemical oxidation of ozone precursors in the presence of NOX. Eastern Asia has the fastest growing anthropogenic emissions in the world, possibly affecting both the pollution in the local troposphere as well as in the trans-Pacific region. Local measurements over Asia show that tropospheric ozone has increased by 1 to 3% per year since the start of the millennium. This increase is often invoked to explain positive ozone trends observed in western United States, but to date there is no unambiguous evidence showing that enhanced Asian pollution is responsible for these trends.\nHere we interpret satellite measurements of tropospheric ozone and its precursor nitrate dioxide from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) using the TM5 global chemistry-transport model to directly show that tropospheric ozone over China has increased by ~10% from 2005-2010 in response to both a ~15% rise in Chinese emissions and an increased downward ozone transport from the stratosphere.\nWhat is more, we demonstrate that Chinese export of ozone and its precursors have offset one-third of the reduction in free tropospheric ozone over the western United States that should have occurred during 2005-2010 via emissions reductions associated with air quality policies in the United States. The issue of export and long-range transport of pollution from other countries indicates that global efforts may be required to address both the global as well as the regional air quality and climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous period is generally considered to have been a time of warm climate, but there is an on-going dispute about the existence of cool interludes - including the short-termed installation of polar ice caps. Mid-Cretaceous shoal-water ecosystems have been proven to show characteristic response modes (e.g., microencruster-blooms) to major climatic and environmental changes related to oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), times of widespread pelagic organic matter burial. Some biotic changes predate OAE1a by few 100kyrs, an observation that is in favour of gradual and pulsed volcanic CO2-outgassing as main trigger of this event.\nWe aim at reconstructing the evolution of Barremian-Aptian sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and SST seasonalities in the prelude, during and in the aftermath of OAE1a. The outer low-Mg calcite-shell layer of rudist bivalves (e.g., Toucasia), collected at carbonate platform settings in the (sub-)tropical Tethyan realm (France, Croatia, Spain), serves both as chemostratigraphic and palaeoclimatic archive. Sclerochronological variations in isotopic (δ18O, δ13C, Mg/Ca, clumped isotopes) and geochemical composition (Sr, Fe, Mn, Ba, Ca/Mg) provide insights into seasonal and long-term palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes. The outcome of this work will be of significance both for those studying the triggering factors of oceanic anoxic events and the palaeoecology of rudist bivalves.",

            "abstract": "Seismic signals near rivers are partially generated by sediment particles impacting the river bed as they are transported downstream. Predicting river channel evolution depends heavily upon understanding when and at what rate this sediment moves. We present two approaches to using these seismic signals to constrain sediment transport. First, we examine hysteresis in the relationship between 1-45 Hz seismic amplitude and flow depth over the course of individual flood events following the removal of a 13 m dam on the Chijiawan River in northern Taiwan. We compare two floods of similar magnitudes with and without bedload transport, and find that the seismic amplitude generated at a given flow depth changes over a single storm only when sediment transport is active. Along-stream variation in hysteresis for each storm appears to scale qualitatively with total sediment transport along the river, and reveals transport patterns consistent with a migrating sediment pulse that is a predicted consequence of the dam removal. Second, we examine the spectral signals of water turbulence, rain, and bedload sediment transport during flood events on the Erlenbach stream in Switzerland. We perform a general linear least squares inversion of the data and find that the signal generated by rain exhibits a roughly broadband spectrum, while discharge and sediment transport exhibit power primarily in lower frequency bands. Our results indicate that seismic signals near rivers may be used to track sediment transport.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary methods focused on increasing urban sustainability are largely based on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. While these efforts are essential steps forward, continued characterization of urban sustainability solely within a biogeochemical framework, with neglect of the biophysical impact of the built environment, omits regional hydroclimatic forcing of the same order of magnitude as greenhouse gas emissions. Using a suite of continuous, multi-year and multi-member continental scale numerical simulations with the WRF model for the U.S., we examine hydroclimatic impacts for a variety of U.S. urban expansion scenarios (for the year 2100) and urban adaptation futures (cool roofs, green roofs, and a hypothetical hybrid approach integrating biophysical properties of both cool and green roofs), and compare those to experiments utilizing a contemporary urban extent. Widespread adoption of adaptation strategies exhibits regionally and seasonally dependent hydroclimatic impacts. For some regions and seasons, urban-induced warming in excess of 3°C can be completely offset by all adaptation approaches examined. For other regions, widespread adoption of some adaptation approaches leads to significant rainfall decline. Sustainable urban expansion therefore requires an integrated assessment that also incorporates biophysically induced urban impacts, and demands tradeoff assessment of various strategies aimed to ameliorate deleterious consequences of growth (e.g., urban heat island reduction).",

            "abstract": "Seasonal runoff and sea-ice cover create highly dynamic estuarine conditions in the Arctic. Studies focusing on major systems such as the Mackenzie have demonstrated how these variables interact to influence nutrient supply and uptake dynamics. Far less is known about the seasonality of smaller estuarine systems in the Arctic. Data collected from lagoons along the eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast show that salinities range from near zero in the spring to as high as 50 in the winter. Runoff and sea-ice thaw in the spring create highly stratified conditions, with hyper-saline bottom waters persisting through the summer in some locations. These variations in physical conditions are accompanied by variations in nitrogen availability within the lagoons. High concentrations of ammonium, and to a lesser extent nitrate, build up under the ice during the winter months. These nutrients are rapidly depleted during the ice break-up period and remain low throughout the summer. Concentrations of organic nitrogen, on the other hand, peak during the ice break-up period. While river inputs contribute directly to this nitrogen peak through the supply of land-derived organic matter, fatty acid markers also show that locally produced organic matter (primarily diatoms) peaks during the ice break-up period. Seasonal changes in nitrogen are accompanied by distinct shifts in microbial community composition as well as changes in stable isotope values of metazoan consumers. Changes in climate that are altering both runoff and sea-ice have the potential to influence the quantity and timing of nutrient availability and associated biological production in arctic coastal waters.",

They record the extreme impacts of an intense interglacial characterized by stronger insolation, warmer mean global temperatures, and higher sea-levels than the Holocene. Results show both extreme hyper-aridity during MIS5e, including an unprecedented drawdown of Dead Sea water levels, and the impacts of a strong precession-driven African monsoon responsible for a major sapropel event (S5) in the eastern Mediterranean.\nHyper-arid conditions at the beginning of MIS5e prior to S5 (~132-128 ka) are evidenced by halite deposition, indicating declining Dead Sea lake levels. Surprisingly, the hyper-arid phase is interrupted during the MIS5e peak (~128-120 ka), coinciding with the S5 sapropel, which is characterized by a thick (23 m) section of silty detritus (without any halite) whose provenance indicates southern-sourced wetness in the watershed. Upon weakening of the S5 monsoon (~120-115 ka), the return of extreme aridity resulted in an unprecedented lake level drawdown, reflected by massive salt deposition, and followed by a sediment hiatus (~115-100 ka) indicating prolonged low lake level. The resumption of section follows classic Levant patterns with more wetness during cooler MIS5b and hyper-aridity during warmer MIS5a.\nThe ICDP core provides the first evidence for a direct linkage between an intense precession-driven African monsoon and wetness at the high subtropical latitude (~30N) of the Dead Sea watershed. Combined with coeval deposition of Negev speleothems and travertines, and calcitification of Red Sea corals, the evidence indicates a wet climatic corridor that could facilitate homo sapiens migration out of Africa during the MIS5e peak. In addition, the MIS 5e hyper-arid intervals may provide an important cautionary analogue for the impact of future warming on regional water resources.",

            "abstract": "Observations of ancient fault zones and results of high temperature friction experiments indicate that silica redistribution influences the rate (response to velocity increases) and state (time-dependent healing) behavior of megathrusts. The Kodiak Accretionary Complex in Alaska has four shear zones that record plate boundary deformation: the Ghost Rocks mélange, the Uganik thrust, the Uyak mélange, and the central belt of the Kodiak Formation. All these examples of underplated rocks represent top-toward-the-trench shear zones that extend along the plate margin for 100’s of kms. The first three examples were accreted within the seismogenic zone and record a progressive history from stratal disruption and particulate flow to localized shearing on pervasive web-like arrays of scaly microfaults in shales. Microfaults show evidence for silica dissolution and local reprecipitation in dilational stepovers and in intensely veined sandstone blocks. The fourth example (the central belt) was accreted further downdip, and these rocks have pervasive, regularly spaced en echelon quartz vein systems. Microstructures within veins indicate periodic cracking and sealing during progressive simple shear. Silica depletion zones adjacent to veins indicate diffusive transport of silica in response to local chemical potential gradients. A simple 1-D transport-kinetics model indicates that cracks in this case could be filled with quartz in less than a year and in as little as a week. Rock friction experiments on lithologies similar to Kodiak examples depict three distinct regimes of frictional behavior as a function of increasing temperature, with velocity weakening in a T range that can be related to the seismogenic zone. These three regimes are predicted by a model for gouge deformation that includes thermally activated pressure solution during shear of quartz grains embedded in a foliated matrix. The slip instabilities that characterize the seismogenic zone may therefore be related in part to grain scale diffusive mass transfer of silica. The observations of Kodiak Fault zones indicate that silica redistribution also plays an important role in the interseismic period through crack healing and dissolution of silica, both along the plate interface and within the adjacent rocks that store elastic strain.",

However, the other half of the eco-morphodynamic feedback—the effects that landscape formation processes have on ecosystem processes—has received focus more recently. Only by studying the couplings in both directions between biological and physical processes simultaneously can we understand the mechanisms important in shaping many landscapes. Here I will illustrate this point with representative examples from recent literature. Although the two-way coupling is essential in landscapes as large and slowly changing as mountain ranges, coastal landscapes provide clear and instructive examples, largely because of the relatively short timescales for landscape/ecosystem evolution in many coastal environments.",

            "abstract": "Undergraduate students in the Keck Geology Consortium Lava Project participated in a month-long investigation of features of basaltic lava flows from two very different perspectives. The first half of the project focused on field relations in basaltic lava flows from the 1984 Krafla Fires eruption in northern Iceland. Students gained valuable experience in the collection of observations and samples in the field leading to hypotheses for the formation of selected features related to lava flow dynamics. Studies focused on a wide range of features including: morphology and heat loss in lava tubes (pyroducts), growth and collapse of lava ponds and overflow deposits, textural changes of lava falls (flow over steep steps), spaced spatter cones from flows over wet ground, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility related to flow kinematics. In the second half of the program students designed, helped execute, documented, and analyzed features similar to those they studied in the field with large-scale (50-250 kg) basaltic lava flows created in the Syracuse University Lava Project (\nhttp://lavaproject.syr.edu\n). Data collected included video from multiple perspectives, infrared thermal (FLIR) images, still images, detailed measurements of flow dimensions and rates, and samples for textural and magnetic analyses. Experimental lava flow features provided critical tests of hypotheses generated in the field and a refined understanding of the behavior and final morphology of basaltic lava flows. The linked field and experimental studies formed the basis for year-long independent research projects under the supervision of their faculty mentors, leading to senior theses at the students’ respective institutions.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere is a primary pathway by which mercury (Hg) enters ecosystems. To adequately assess the risk to humans and wildlife the chemistry of atmospheric Hg must be understood, along with the processes controlling deposition and assimilation into ecosystems. Given current high uncertainties with the Tekran analytical system used to measure gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM) and particulate bound Hg (PBM) recent work has combined these for data analyses as Reactive Hg (RM). GOM measurements using this system are biased low due to lack of efficient collection of different compounds and interferences with water vapor and ozone. Because of this, estimation of GOM dry deposition to ecosystems using concentrations derived from this instrument in models are biased low, and dry deposition measured with surrogate surfaces are typically higher than model values. It is likely that different compounds of GOM are present in the atmosphere. These will have different chemical and physical properties that will influence atmospheric behavior. Field and laboratory results have shown that a new active Hg collection system using membranes collected higher GOM concentrations than the Tekran KCl-coated denuder. Field data from 5 locations showed that different GOM compounds were present across space and time.\nMore work is needed to calibrate existing methods and develop methods to measure GOM. New approaches include collection of GOM on a membrane to determine concentrations; couple this with a ramp heating thermo-desorption through a pyrolyzer into a Tekran 2537, or GC-MS, to understand the chemistry of GOM compounds; and passive samplers for long-term global Hg monitoring of GOM. Lastly, during the NOMADSS/SAS experiment 2 Hg analyzers were used, with one having a cation exchange membrane and the other a pyrolyzer in-line to get GOM by difference. In all cases, calibration sources must be used to understand the GOM collection and recovery efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas contribute ~75% of fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) emissions, and city governments are often leading the way in emission reduction efforts. As emissions are regulated and assigned a price, there is an increasing need to independently evaluate the reported bottom-up emissions and to attribute them to specific source sectors (e.g. electricity production, industry, vehicles). We demonstrate how multispecies atmospheric observations can be used to achieve this.\nThe Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) aims to develop and evaluate methods for detection and attribution of urban GHG fluxes. The INFLUX observation network includes twelve towers measuring in situ CO2 and CO and flask measurements of another 50 species. 14CO2 measurements have shown that in winter, the total CO2 enhancement over Indianapolis approximates the CO2ff added. This somewhat surprising result allows us to use the wintertime in situ total CO2 and CO measurements to determine the observed CO:CO2ff ratio (RCO) at high resolution. First, we demonstrate that the USEPA CO inventory for Indianapolis overestimates CO emissions by a factor of about 2.5. Then we use the Hestia bottom-up CO2ff data product and revised characteristic RCO values for each CO2ff source sector to predict the diurnal cycle in RCO for Indianapolis. The tower observations and bottom-up RCO estimates are consistent during the daytime, but the observed RCO is significantly higher than the bottom-up estimate during the night. We show how the bottom-up and top-down methods can be used together to determine the cause of this discrepancy and improve CO2ff estimates from both methods.",

            "abstract": "The Indian Ocean tsunami (IOT) devastated several countries of North Indian Ocean. India is one of the worst affected countries after Indonesia and Sri Lanka. In India, Tamil Nadu suffered maximum with fatalities exceeding 8,000 people. Historical records show that tsunami has invaded the shores of Tamil Nadu in the past and has made people realize that the tsunami threat looms over Tamil Nadu and it is necessary to evolve strategies for tsunami threat management. The IOT has brought to light that tsunami inundation and runup varied within short distances and for the disaster management for tsunami, large scale maps showing areas that are likely to be affected by future tsunami are identified. Therefore threat assessment for six villages including Mamallapuram (also called Mahabalipuram) which is famous for its rock-cut temples, from the northern part of Tamil Nadu state of India has been carried out and threat maps categorizing the coast into areas of different degree of threat are prepared. The threat was assessed by numerical modeling using TUNAMI N2 code considering different tsunamigenic sources along the Andaman – Sumatra trench. While GEBCO and C-Map data was used for bathymetry and for land elevation data was generated by RTK – GPS survey for a distance of 1 km from shore and SRTM for the inland areas. The model results show that in addition to the Sumatra source which generated the IOT in 2004, earthquakes originating in Car Nicobar and North Andaman can inflict more damage. The North Andaman source can generate a massive tsunami and an earthquake of magnitude more than Mw 9 can not only affect Tamil Nadu but also entire south east coast of India. The runup water level is used to demarcate the tsunami threat zones in the villages using GIS.",

            "abstract": "The last two years have seen the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the third US National Climate Assessment (NCA). In addition to these high profile climate assessments, many regional, state, and municipal entities are leveraging the emerging climate science and scaling the process and the data to develop climate assessments relevant to decision making at sub-national scales. One such example is the assessment Climate Change in Colorado: A Synthesis to Support Water Resources Management and Adaptation. The report (released in August 2014) expands and updates an earlier Climate Change in Colorado assessment that was published in October 2008.\nThe 2008 Colorado assessment took a hybrid approach to assessment, marrying the IPCC Working Group I focus on physical science, with the adaptation components raditionally embedded within Working Group II. The Colorado assessment approach included the transparency and open review that underpin the credibility of the IPCC and NCA processes. A modest amount of original research was undertaken, which is a slight deviation from the IPCC and NCA processes. The state-based process also used a co-production model that engages users directly at the outset of the process. The 2008 and 2014 reports used the same process, but the newer assesment is vastly expanded in scope.\nThe efficacy of the process is demonstrated by the use of the Colorado assessments by decision makers. The science in the 2008 report supported the Colorado State Drought Plan, Climate Adaptation Plans for several Colorado Counties, and the State Water Supply Initiative. Components of the 2014 assessment have been used as the science basis for Denver's Climate Adaptation Plan.\nDecisions that involve climate adaptation tend to happen at sub-regional scales. Consequently, IPCC and NCA documents are not as informative for adaptation planning at regional and state scales as localized assessments. This does not diminish the importance of the IPCC and NCA. Without concerted effort at larger scales, the rich pool of climate science available to inform efforts at smaller scales would not exist. Ensuring that processes are implemented that connect climate assessment at multiple scales will ensure the value of climate assessments in decision making.",

            "abstract": "Dating of single detrital mineral grains (typically zircon and apatite) using geochronology and low-temperature (LT) thermochronology is now an established tool in the investigation of a range of geologic processes and problems. For example, detrital zircon U-Pb (DZ) geochronology can be applied to derive maximum depositional age, reconstruct sediment provenance and routing systems, correlate isolated stratigraphic horizons, and characterize remote source terrane geology. Detrital LT thermochronology (fission track and (U-Th)/He dating) can be applied additionally to reconstruct source region cooling and exhumation history through use of lag-time – the time taken between a mineral grain cooling below its closure temperature and its time of deposition. While each of these methods in isolation are very valuable tools, they do have some limitations. For example, DZ geochronology cannot differentiate different sources with the same crystallization age, the youngest DZ age population may be older than depositional age, large orogenic or metamorphic episodes may not produce much primary zircon, and recycling of zircon grains can lead to incorrect interpretation of syn-depositional versus primary sediment source. Detrital LT thermochronology has additional problems such as syn-depositional age volcanic grains leading to erroneous lag-time interpretation. Many of these issues can be overcome by obtaining combining multiple dating techniques on single grains, with the bonus of acquiring higher resolution provenance information. While multi-dating does present analytical challenges, a number of studies have explored this approach in recent years. Here we show how detrital apatite and zircon double- and triple-dating of sediments of varying age (Cretaceous to Holocene) from offshore Antarctica provides a novel new approach to reconstructing the pre-glacial and glacial landscape evolution of this hidden continent over the last few hundred million years. In addition it provided an opportunity to test the optimum methodological approach to triple-dating, particularly for apatite, as well as evaluate potential issues such uncertainties inherent in (U-Th)/He ages acquired from part-polished grains, and whether lasing and/or fission track etching influence age reliability and reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "The thermal conditions of magma storage control many aspects of the dynamics of a magma reservoir system. For example, the temperature of magma storage directly relates to the crystallinity, and magmas stored at relatively low temperatures in a crystal mush (more than 40-50% crystalline) must be remobilized (e.g., by heating) before they can be erupted. A better understanding of the duration of magma storage at largely-liquid vs. largely-solid conditions is thus critical to understanding crustal magmatic processes such as magma mixing and for quantifying the hazard potential of a given volcano. Although mineral thermometry reflects the conditions of crystal growth or equilibration, these may not correspond to the thermal conditions of crystal storage. The duration of crystal storage at high temperatures can be quantified by comparing U-series crystal ages with the time scales over which disequilibrium trace-element profiles in the same crystals would be erased by diffusion. In the case of Mount Hood, OR, such a comparison for the two most recent eruptions shows that <12% of the total lifetime of plagioclase crystals (minimum 21 kyr) was spent at temperatures high enough that the magma would be easily mobilized. Partial data sets for other systems suggest such behavior is common, although the diffusion and U-series ages in these cases are from different samples and may not be directly comparable. We will present preliminary data combining U-series dating and diffusion timescales on the same samples for other volcanic systems (e.g., Lassen Volcanic Center, Mount St. Helens, Okataina Volcanic Center, New Zealand). Combining these data with numerical models offers additional insights into the controls on the conditions of storage. In addition, extension of this approach to combining U-Th ages with time scales of Li diffusion in zircon offers a promising new method to quantify thermal histories of silicic reservoir systems.",

            "abstract": "Iron is an important element in soils, often in forms either of crystalline mineral or amorphous colloids upon redox cycling in hydromorphic soils. However, role of iron particularly via oxyhydrates in organic matter dynamics n rice soils has been not yet well assessed. Rice paddy soils of China have been recognized as a unique type of Anthrosols mostly with iron accumulation and dynamic movement in soil profile through long term hydroagric management. Soil organic matter contents of rice soils are shown significantly correlated with the contents of free or amorphous iron oxyhydrates. And organic matter accumulation in young rice soils followed iron oxyhydrate content changes as rice cultivation proceed, which could be often traced by the changes in iron oxyhydrate-bound OC fractions. The importance of association of OC with iron oxyhydrates is known by the fact that organic carbon was not related to total free iron oxyhydrates in wetland but in rice soil shifted from the wetlands, with OC contents much higher in rice soils than in the precedent wetland soil. This could be attributed to the chemical binding of OC to oxyhydrate surface, contributing to the stabilization of newly sequestered OC. This has been again confirmed by lab incubation studies, where total mineralization of OC has been found significantly lower in iron-oxyhrate rich soil than in iron-oxyhrate poor soils. This effect has been further explored in an incubation study with experimental warming that the temperature dependence of OC mineralization of rice soils from a long term fertilizer treated trial was linked to the abundance of iron oxyhydrate content, varying with the long term management practice. Initial carbon sequestration in rice soil subject to new carbon input was promoted by the iron oxyhydrates in the soil, showing a fast increase in iron hydrate-bound OC in the initial stage. The bound OC exerted further stabilization through enhanced humification to form residual OC fraction in long term, which was demonstrated with the molecular changes in iron oxyhydrate bound fraction of OC in the final stage of incubation. Therefore, iron cycling through dynamic changes with redox fluctuations could be closely linked to C cycling in rice sols, of which the processes and the associated mineral-OC-microbial interactions have been poorly understood.",

Intense occurrences of these storms are classified as monsoon depressions and are responsible for many monsoon precipitation extremes. Despite the importance of monsoon low pressure systems, their dynamics are incompletely understood and there is little understanding of their sensitivity to larger scale climate forcings such as changing greenhouse gas concentrations. In this talk I present an overview of monsoon low pressure systems, their dynamics, and their connection with meteorological extremes. I discuss the possible relevance of both moist baroclinic growth and tropical cyclogenesis mechanisms to disturbance amplification, and review how these systems cluster in association with larger-scale intraseasonal modes such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation. I summarize recent results indicating that, contrary to previously established thinking, Indian monsoon depressions propagate westward against the low-level mean monsoon flow because of nonlinear, adiabatic self-advection (i.e. beta drift).

Yet, at least anecdotally, there is a growing tendency for many people to reject science without knowing what they are rejecting, and the ranks of scientists are thinned by having so many students arrive at our universities neither prepared to study science nor open to the possibility of doing so. This growing gap represents a growing opportunity for scientists to use their expertise in the service of humanity. Based on my experience, the biggest requirement for scientists to do so is simply to engage, but engagement is more successful in teamwork with experienced communicators and unexpected voices, and using narrative and history.",

They also investigate the predictability of MC precipitation variations. The hindcast of the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) and several other NOAA data sets are mainly analyzed.\nThe seasonal evolution of MC precipitation does not exhibit features for four seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter) apparently as the precipitation variations over many places of the world do. Instead, it is clearly characterized by a wet season (from December to March) and a dry season (from July to October). Both the wet-season precipitation and the dry-season precipitation over MC are significantly related to ENSO and Asian-Australian monsoon features. When ENSO signal is removed, the MC precipitation is more strongly related to climate features over East Asia in the wet season and tropical Australia in the dry season.\nThe NCEP CFSv2 shows a high skill in predicting the main features of MC precipitation variations and their relationships with larger-scale climate anomalies. It can predict the total amount and the most dominant mode of MC precipitation skillfully by several months in advance, especially for the dry season.",

            "abstract": "Space plasmas are often characterized by the presence of energetic particles in the background, e.g. due to various electron acceleration mechanisms [1]. This phenomenon is associated with a power-law dependence at high (superthermal) velocity values, modeled by a kappa-type distribution function, which reproduces observed data more efficiently that the standard Maxwellian distribution approach [2]. It has been shown from first principles that this ubiquitous superthermal feature of plasmas may alter the propagation characteristics of plasma modes, and modify the plasma screening properties [3].\nIn this presentation I will review, from first principles, the effects of a non-Maxwellian electron distribution on the characteristics of electrostatic plasma modes. A kappa distribution function [1] is employed to model the deviation of a plasma constituent (electrons, in general) from Maxwellian equlibrium. It will be shown that the excess in superthermal propulation modifies the charge screening mechanism, affecting the dispersion laws of both low- and higher frequency modes significantly. Various experimental observations may thus be interpreted as manifestations of excess superthermality [2]. Focusing on the features of nonlinear excitations (shocks, solitons), we investigate the role of superthermality in their propagation dynamics (existence laws, stability profile) and dynamical profile [3]. The relation to other nonthermal plasma theories is briefly discussed.\n[1] See V.M. Vasyliunas, J. Geophys. Res. 73, 2839 (1968), for a historical reference; also, V. Pierrard and M.

            "abstract": "Agricultural management in river catchments must combine the objectives of economic profit and environmental stewardship and, in many countries, mitigate the decline of water quality and/or maintain high water quality. Achieving these objectives is, amongst other activities, in the remit of ‘sustainable intensification’. Of concern is the efficient use of crop nutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, and minimising or offsetting the effects of transfers from land to water – corner-stone requirements of many agri-environmental regulations. This requires a robust monitoring programme that can audit the stages of nutrient inputs and outputs in river catchments and indicate where the likely points of successful policy interventions can be observed – or confounded. In this paper, a catchment, or watershed, experimental design and results are described for monitoring the nutrient transfer continuum in the Irish agricultural landscape against the backdrop of the European Union Nitrates and Water Framework Directives. This Agricultural Catchments Programme experimental design also serves to indicate water quality pressure-points that may be catchment specific as agricultural activities intensify to adapt to national efforts to build important parts of the post-recession economy.",

            "abstract": "After the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, we have intensively explored earthquake-induced records in the deep-sea basins close to rupture zones of the 2011 and past earthquakes in Tohoku, Our study area focuses on small terminal basins near the trench for the following reason. Mass transport deposits from up-slope area down into the Japan Trench axis floor during the 2011 event were documented (e. g. Oguri et al., 2013). Similarly past earthquake-induced turbidites were expected to have been deposited in a number of small basins in the trench floor and in a lower slope terrace. Here we introduce our recent results and future prospects for paleoseismology in the Japan Trench. We collected cores from areas that are generally composed of diatomaceous fine grain sediment and fine-grained turbidites. Occasionally, wide spread tephra patches/layers are intercalated in the sediment. In the trench floor, two thick turbidite units below (older) than the 2011 event deposits were identified in up to 10m long sedimentary cores. An intercalated tephra within these turbidite units indicates that turbidites were triggered by historical earthquakes in Tohoku (Ikehara et al., in prep). On the other hand, frequent occurrence of thin-bedded turbidites was identified in the lower slope terrace. Several turbidite layers can be correlated over a wide area by tephra-correlation and matching of paleomagnetic secular variations (Usami et al., in this session). Turbidite-stratigraphy from both locations, the trench and lower slope terrace shows a similar pattern, and seems to be tied to the onland tsunami deposit stratigraphy straightforwardly. These observations suggest that deep-sea turbidite records are more reliable proxy for paleoseimic-stratigraphy of the Tohoku area. Encouraged by the results obtained so far, we plan extensive investigations in the area over the next few years to document effectively the spatiotemporal distribution of earthquake records of Tohoku.",

            "abstract": "Granitoid dykes up to several hundred metres wide and 2 km long are found in depleted harzburgites in the mantle section of the Oman ophiolite. They vary in composition from tonalite to potassic granite and are generally more potassic than the crustal plagiogranites found within the sheeted dyke complex higher up within the ophiolite stratigraphy. Some granites are strongly peraluminous and contain garnet and andalusite. They are geochemically variable, some with REE that are relatively unfractionated ((La/Yb)n= 3.5-6.0, flat middle to heavy REE, steep light REE) to those which are highly fractionated ((La/Yb)n= 28-220). On primitive-mantle normalised plots some have very high concentrations of fluid-mobile elements – Cs, Rb, Th, U and Pb. Few have significant Ta-Nb anomalies. On the Ca-Fe-Mg-Ti discrimination diagram of Patino Douce (J. Petrol., 1999) whole-rock compositions define a spectrum between felsic-pelite derived melts and amphibolite-derived melts.\nThere is a chemical similarity between the least REE fractionated plagiogranites (generally tonalites and granodiorites) and melts of an amphibolitic parent. This is supported by the occurrence of mafic xenoliths in some dykes, the presence of hornblende and highly calcic cores (up to An85) in some plagioclase grains. Trace element modelling using Oman Geotimes lavas as the starting composition indicates that melting took place in the garnet stability field, although enrichment in the melt in Cs, Rb, Ba and Pb suggests that there was another component present in addition to the mafic parent. Other plagiogranites (trondhjemites and granites) have a strongly peraluminous chemistry and mineralogy and geochemical similarities with the Himalayan leucogranites implying that they were derived from a sedimentary protolith. These mantle plagiogranites are more prevalent in the northern outcrops of the ophiolite.\nThe volume of granitoid melt and the depth of melting preclude their derivation from the sole of the ophiolite, rather they were derived during subduction by the partial melting of the slab and associated sediment and emplaced into the overlying mantle wedge. Current subduction-initiation models for supra-subduction ophiolites should integrate this process into their thinking.",

            "abstract": "The Sybaris town was founded by the Greeks in 720 B.C and its life went on up to the late Roman time (VI-VII century A.D.). The town was located within the Sibari Plain near the Crati River mouth (Ionian northern Calabria, southern Italy). Sybaris occurs in area repeatedly affected by natural damaging phenomena, as frequent flooding, high local subsidence, marine storms, and earthquakes. The 2700 year long record of history of Sybaris stores the traces of these natural events and their influence on the human ancient environment through time.\nAmong the natural disasters, we recognize two Roman age earthquakes striking the town. We isolate the damaging of these seismic events, set their time of occurrence, and map a shear zone crossing the site. These results were obtained through i) survey of coseismic features on the ruins, ii) geoarchaeological stratigraphy analysis, and TL and C14 dating, iii) analysis of high-resolution topographic data (1m pixel LiDAR DEM).\nThe Sybaris town showed a persistent resilience to the earthquakes, and following their occurrences the site was not abandoned but underwent remodeling of the urban topography.\nThe interaction of the different approaches reveals the presence of a previously unknown fault crossing the archeological site, the Sybaris fault. The high-resolution topography allows the characterization of subtle geomorphological features and hydrological anomalies, tracing the fault extension, whose Holocene activity is controlling the local morphology and the present Crati river course.",

One reason is that it is hardly possible to directly monitor at depth the magma storage areas. One way to overcome this limit is to use seismic waves that, through their propagation, directly sample the targets of interest. This presentation will summarize recent advances and perspectives in characterizing volcanic systems using noise-based seismic monitoring. In particular, we will focus on Piton de la Fournaise volcano where a wide variety of processes including long-term magma pressure buildup, flank deformation, environmental perturbations and short-term eruption preparation are imaged. We will also show an example in Japan where mapping the seismic velocity susceptibility to transient stress perturbations allows characterizing the state of pressurized volcanic systems. We will discuss the perspectives of noise-based 4-D tomography that will be made possible in the future thanks to the availability of dense seismic networks including large-N arrays and intensive computational facilities.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Suigetsu cores (SG06 and SG14) from Honshu Island, central Japan, provide a high-resolution paleoenvironmental record for the last ~200 kyrs. The composite record is ~85 m-long and it contains numerous tephras, more than 35 visible and numerous non-visible layers (cryptotephra).\nThe major and trace element glass chemistry of these tephras allows the layers to be correlated to specific eruptions and tephra layers in other archives [1]. The record preserves large eruptions from volcanoes from Kyushu, Honshu, South Korea, and smaller explosive events from more proximal volcanoes, Daisen and Sanbe. The Lake Suigetsu has a very detailed varve and radiocarbon chronology [2] that has been exploited to provide precise ages for the tephra layers from the last 50 kyrs [1]. These ages can constrain the tempo of volcanic activity, and the age models of other sedimentary (paleoenvironmental and archaeological) records that contain the tephra.\nThe deeper parts of the Suigetsu core are not continuosly annually laminated and are outside the radiocarbon timeframe and therefore do not have a well constrined chronology. The tephra layers can be used to provide an absolute chronology as eruption deposits from South Korea, Daisen and Sanbe often contain K-rich crystal phases, which can be dated using 40Ar/39Ar methods. Correlating these distal tephra layers in Lake Suigetsu to proximal deposits, using the glass chemistry, is essential as large crystals are required to obtain precise 40Ar/39Ar ages and these are only abundant in the coarser proximal deposits [3, 4].\nThese widespread marker layers can be also be used for relative chronology. Identifying the same tephras in disparate high-resolution archives allows them to be directly compared so that leads and lags in paleoclimate can be identified on the regional to continental scale, providing some insight into the fundamental drivers of the Earth’s climate system.\n ",

            "abstract": "Tropical mid-tropospheric temperature (TMT) time series have been constructed by several independent research teams using satellite microwave sounding unit (MSU) measurements beginning in 1978 and advanced MSU (AMSU) measurements since 1998. Despite careful efforts to homogenize the MSU/AMSU measurements, tropical TMT trends disagree by a factor of three even though each analysis uses the same basic data. Previous studies suggest that the discrepancy in tropical TMT temperature trends is largely caused by differences in both the NOAA-9 warm target factor and diurnal drift corrections used by various teams to homogenize the MSU/AMSU measurements. This work introduces a new observationally-based method for removing biases related to satellite diurnal drift. The method relies on minimizing inter-satellite and inter-node drifts by subtracting out a common diurnal cycle determined via linear regression. It is demonstrated that this method is effective at removing intersatellite biases and biases between the ascending (PM) and descending (AM) node of individual satellites in the TMT time series. After TMT bias correction, the ratio of tropical tropospheric temperature trends relative to surface temperature trends is in accord with the ratio from global climate models. It is shown that bias corrections for diurnal drift based on a climate model produce tropical trends very similar to those from the observationally-based correction, with a trend differences smaller than 0.02 K decade-1. Differences among various TMT datasets are explored further. Tropical trends from this work are comparable to those from the Remote Sensing System (RSS) and NOAA datasets despite small differences. Larger differences between this work and UAH are attributed to differences in the treatment of the NOAA-9 target factor and the UAH diurnal cycle correction.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mandate is an example of this type of ‘gap filling,’ in which the elimination of uncertainties is presumed to enable rational decision making for individuals and rational governance for societies. Presumed knowledge deficits, though, are unsuited to controversial problems with social, cultural, and economic dimensions; likewise, communication to educate is an ineffective means of inciting behavioural change. An alternative is needed, particularly given the economic, social, and political scale that action on climate change requires. We review the 'deficit-education framing' and show how it maintains a wedge between those affected and those whose knowledge is required.

We are able to produce ever more sophisticated models but they can only inform us about the Earth in a meaningful way if we can assign uncertainties to the models. Bayesian inference is a natural choice for this task as it handles uncertainty in a natural way by explicitly modeling assumptions. Another desirable property is that Bayes' theorem contains Occam's razor implicitly. I will present our efforts over the that last 10 years to infer Earth properties using an approach we called probabilistic tomography. The word pragmatic has several meanings in this context. In more classical Bayesian inference problems, we usually prescribe subjective or informative priors. I will illustrate this by showing examples which employ the neighborhood algorithm (Sambridge, 1999) or a Metropolis rule (Mosegaard and Tarantola, 1995). Recently we started to use neural networks to parametrize the posterior. In our implementation, we do not sample the posterior directly, but make predictions on some properties of the posterior. The interpretation of the uncertainty is therefore slightly different, but the method informs us on the information gain with respect to the prior. I will show examples on source and structural inversions using so-called mixture density networks.",

            "abstract": "A substantial increase in fluvial sediment supply causes complex, large-magnitude changes in river and floodplain morphology. Although sedimentary and geomorphic responses to sediment influx are a fundamental part of landscape evolution, few opportunities exist to quantify those processes over field scales. We investigated downstream effects of sediment released during the largest dam removal in history, on the Elwha River, WA, USA, by measuring changes in riverbed elevation and topography, bed-sediment grain size, and channel planform as two dams were removed in stages over two years.\nAs 10.5 million t (7.1 million m3) of sediment was released from two former reservoirs, downstream dispersion of a sediment wave caused widespread bed aggradation of ~1 m (greater where pools filled), changed the river from pool-riffle to braided morphology, and decreased the slope of the lowermost river. The newly deposited sediment, which was finer than most of the pre-dam-removal bed, formed new bars (largely pebble, granule, and sand material), prompting aggradational channel avulsion that increased the channel braiding index by almost 50%. As a result of mainstem bed aggradation, floodplain channels received flow and accumulated new sediment even during low to moderate flow conditions. The river system showed a two- to ten-fold greater geomorphic response to dam removal (bed-elevation change) than it had to a 40-year flood event four years before dam removal. Two years after dam removal began, as the river had started to incise through the new deposits, approximately 1.2 million t of new sediment (~10% of the amount released from the two reservoirs) was stored along 18 river km of the mainstem channel and 25 km of floodplain channels. The Elwha River thus was able to transport most of the released sediment to the river mouth. The geomorphic alterations and changing bed-sediment grain size along the Elwha River have important ecological implications, affecting aquatic habitat structure, benthic fauna, salmonid fish spawning and rearing potential, and riparian vegetation. Response of the Elwha River to dam removal represents a unique opportunity to observe and quantify fundamental geomorphic processes associated with a massive sediment influx, and also provides important lessons for future river restorations.",

The predictability of 21stcentury climate change in this region is affected significantly by the large atmospheric internal variability, driven in part by external tropical influences.\nIn this talk an assessment of 21st century projections of westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea (UAS) will be presented, based on output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble. The focus will be on quantifying the importance of model uncertainty and internal climate variability in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario projections and identifying potential sources of model uncertainty. In general the CMIP5 ensemble-mean response exhibits increases in UAS over the 21st century, with the Amundsen Sea being positioned on the poleward flank of large-scale westerly wind increases across mid-to-low latitudes. In terms of the annual mean, increases of 0.3 and 0.7 m s-1are simulated following the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively. However, as a consequence of large internal climate variability over the Amundsen Sea, it takes until approximately 2030 (2065) for the RCP8.5 response to exceed one (two) standard deviation(s) of decadal internal variability.\nIn all scenarios and seasons the model uncertainty is large. However the present-day climatological zonal wind bias over the whole South Pacific, which is important for tropical teleconnections, is strongly related to inter-model differences in projected change in UAS (more skilful models show larger UAS increases). This relationship is significant in winter (r = -0.56) and spring (r = -0.65), when the influence of the tropics on the Amundsen Sea region is known to be important. Horizontal grid spacing and present day sea ice extent were not found to be significant sources of inter-model spread. Possible physical/dynamical explanations for the above correlations will be discussed, in particular considering the role of tropical-Antarctic teleconnections and including current work extending the analysis to the Atlantic and Indian sectors.",

Users are given the option to search based on high-level parameter groups, individual common names, mission and platform, as well as date ranges. Experienced users can immediately filter by keyword using the global search option. Once the user has chosen their required variables, they are given the option to either request PI data files based on their search criteria or create merged data, i.e. geo-located data from one or more measurement PIs. The purpose of the merged data feature is to allow users to compare data from one flight, as not all data from each flight is taken on the same time scale. Time bases can be continuous or based on the time base from one of the measurement time scales and intervals.

            "abstract": "The evacuation of large silicic magma reservoirs via catastrophic caldera forming eruptions that emplace 100s to 1000s of km3 of material is a devastating and rare natural disaster on Earth. Given the destructive nature of these eruptions, it is critical to better understand the evolution of large silicic systems and what parameters are responsible for either maintaining magma in storage conditions or triggering an eruption. The formation of large, shallow magma bodies requires thermal maturation of the upper crust through elevated magma fluxes over periods of 104-106 years. Once the crust is thermally primed, the viscoelastic response of the host rock buffers the reservoir and stifles the generation of significant overpressure, thus accommodating the accumulation of large magma volumes (103-104 km3). Given that overpressures are difficult to generate in magma reservoirs of this size, increasing attention has been focused on better understanding what mechanisms may trigger their eruption. Recent analytical models suggest that buoyancy may play a critical role in generating the necessary overpressures to trigger eruption of the largest systems. We build upon these findings and utilize numerical models to quantify overpressure generation due to buoyancy and magmatic recharge. Furthermore, the interplay between reservoir growth and fault formation is explored to determine whether eruption triggering is most likely to occur due to fault development within the overlying roof or due to rupture at the reservoir boundary. Specifically, we utilize viscoelastic finite element models with Mohr-Coulomb and von Mises failure criteria to explore foundering in the roof and failure development at the reservoir boundary during buoyant magma recharge. Presented results will compare temperature- and non-temperature dependent viscosities with elastic models to investigate end-member controls on fault formation and reservoir rupture.",

            "abstract": "Over the past century, hydrological science has evolved through distinct eras as judged by ideas, information sources, technological advances and societal influences: Empirical Era which was data based with little theory, Systems Era that focused on input-output relationships, Process Era with a focus on processes, and the Geosciences Era where hydrology was considered an Earth System science. We argue that as the human footprint on earth becomes increasingly dominant, we are moving into a Co-evolution Era. Co-evolution implies that the components of the Earth system are intimately intertwined at many time scales – fast scales of immediate feedbacks that translate into slow scale interdependencies and trends. These involve feedbacks between the atmosphere, biota, soils and landforms, mediated by water flow and transport processes. The human factor is becoming a key component of this coupled system. While there is a long tradition of considering effects of water on humans, and vice versa, the new thrust on socio-hydrology has a number of defining characteristics that sets it apart from traditional approaches:\n- Capturing feedbacks of human-natural water system in a dynamic way (slow and fast processes) to go beyond prescribing human factors as mere boundary conditions. These feedbacks will be essential to understand how the system may evolve in the future into new, perhaps previously unobserved, states.\n- Quantifying system dynamics in a generalizable way. So far, water resources assessment has been context dependent, tied to local conditions. While for immediate decision making this is undoubtedly essential, for more scientific inquiry, a more uniform knowledge base is indispensable.\n- Not necessarily predictive. The coupled human-nature system is inherently non-linear, which may prohibit predictability in the traditional sense. The socio-hydrologic approach may still be predictive in a statistical sense and, perhaps even more importantly, it may yet reveal possible futures not predicted by traditional forecasts, yet essential for long-term decision making.\nGuided by these overarching arguments, and a review of recent progress, we will present a structured overview of socio-hydrology, framing the theoretical, observational and methodological challenges that lie ahead and ways to address them.",

We present a conceptual modeling framework to understand and characterize these transitions. In this way, we aim to capture the potential drivers of the desired shift towards achieving sustainability of socio-hydrological systems. This is done through a synthesis of detailed socio-hydrological analyses of four river basins in three continents, carried out using different quantitative socio-hydrologic models: Murrumbidgee River Basin in eastern Australia, Lake Toolibin Catchment in Western Australia, Tarim River Basin in Western China and Kissimmee River Basin, in south-east United States. The case studies are analysed using either place-based models designed specifically to mimic observed long-term socio-hydrologic trends, or generic conceptual models with foundations in diverse strands of literature including sustainability science and resilience theory. A comparative analysis of the four case studies reveals a commonality in the building blocks employed to model these socio-hydrologic systems; including water balance, economic, environmental and human-feedback components. Each model reveals varying interpretations of a common organising principle that could explain the shift between productive (socio-economic) and restorative (environmental) forces that was evident in each of these systems observed over a long time frame. The emergent principle is related to the essential drivers of the human feedback component and rests with a general formulation of human well-being, as reflected by both their economic and environmental well-being. It is envisaged that the understanding of the system drivers gained from such a comparative study would enable more targeted water management strategies that can be administered in developing basins to achieve overall sustainability.",

We conduct a statistical analysis to correlate changes in these four key drivers to potential causal mechanisms, including atmospheric aerosol concentration and changes in the extent of irrigated cropland, which we identify using a novel, high accuracy landcover dataset. Finally, we use the DSSAT maize model, together with counter-factual climate scenarios, to investigate the implications of the PET decline on maize yields and maize irrigation demand.

Here we present the first seawater Si isotope data set from the East China Sea (ECS), a large and productive marginal sea system in the western North Pacific, to examine sources and utilization of Si(OH)4. During two cruises in summer (August 2009) and in winter (December 2009-January 2010), samples for δ30SiSi(OH)4 analyses were collected along a cross-shelf transect, extending from near the mouth of the Changjiang River estuary to the slope area open to the Kuroshio Current (KC). In summer, the lowest surface δ30SiSi(OH)4 coincided with the highest Si(OH)4 concentrations observed nearest to the shore in the Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW). During advection on the ECS inner shelf, surface δ30SiSi(OH)4 increased rapidly from ~2.1‰ to ~3.1‰ while Si(OH)4 became highly depleted, indicating significant biological utilization and fractionation of Si isotopes from the CDW. Such fractionation was also seen from the vertical profiles characterized by a general decrease of δ30SiSi(OH)4 and an increase of Si(OH)4 with depth. In winter however, values of both parameters were nearly constant throughout the water column on the ECS shelf. The enhanced intrusion of the KC and vertical mixing dominated the distribution of the seawater δ30SiSi(OH)4 signatures. Significant seasonal differences in δ30SiSi(OH)4 were detected in the surface waters beyond the CDW region on the ECS shelf, where the winter values were ~1.0‰ lower than those in summer. Given that Si(OH)4 in these surface waters were primarily sourced from the Kuroshio subsurface water during both seasons, such seasonality suggested higher biological consumption and fractionation in summer than in winter.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional seismic images of slabs and other mantle structures provide a first order constraint on the forces driving plate motions. Previous attempts to invert for plate motions from seismic images have blurry slabs that do not act as stress guides. Using forward models, we describe characteristics needed to capture the coupling between mantle structures and plates. In forward models, we capitalized on advances in adaptive mesh refinement and scalable solvers to simulate global mantle flow and plate motions, with plate margins resolved down to 1 km. Cold thermal anomalies within the lower mantle are coupled into oceanic plates through narrow high-viscosity slabs, altering the velocity of oceanic plates. Back-arc extension and slab rollback are emergent consequences of slab descent in the upper mantle. The forward models require the solution of a highly ill-conditioned non-linear Stokes equation. Based on a realistic rheological model with yielding and strain rate weakening from dislocation creep, we formulate inverse problems casted as PDE-constrained optimization problems and derive adjoints of the nonlinear Stokes and incompressibility equations. An inexact-Gauss Newton method is used to infer the rheological parameters while quantifying the uncertainty using the Hessian at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point. Through 2-D numerical experiments we demonstrate that when the temperature field is known from seismic images, we can recover all of these properties to varying levels of certainty: strength of plate boundaries, yield stress and strain rate exponent in the upper mantle. When the system becomes more unconstrained (when all three mechanical properties are unknown), there can be tradeoffs depending on how well the data approximates the realistic dynamics. As plate boundaries become weaker beyond a limiting value, the uncertainty of the inferred parameters increases due to insensitivity of plate motion to plate coupling. Using the inverse of the Hessian, we show approximations to tradeoffs between inferred quantities and compare them against tradeoffs exhibited by forward solves within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We find that posterior distribution using the Hessian at the MAP point is locally a good approximation to the posterior distribution found with MCMC.",

An overview of the potential sources of Arctic sea ice predictability on these timescales will be given. Then, current approaches to generate ensemble sea ice reconstructions and initialize climate predictions will be described. The performances over the satellite era of the EC-Earth and CNRM-CM coupled models in predicting the Arctic sea ice cover and its spatial characteristics on seasonal timescales will finally be presented.",

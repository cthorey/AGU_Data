            "abstract": "The topography of an orogen reflects the complex interplay between processes that occur at depth in the crust and processes such as erosion and weathering that shape the surface landscape. Reconstructions of paleotopography are critical for evaluating geodynamic models and separating effects of climatic and tectonic change in terrestrial records. Stable isotope paleoaltimetry has proved to be an important tool for understanding changes in topography through time, however this approach is complicated by factors such as mixing of moisture sources, uncertainty over how uplift impacts air mass transport and resultant isotope hydrology, and debate over what some proxies actually record. Hydrogen isotopes of organic molecules provide a means of reconstructing isotopes of ambient water, but these data are also impacted by factors that affect biological processes and stomatal regulation. Despite the myriad factors that can impact isotope fractionation in plant waxes, a growing body of data show these molecules to be an important record of precipitation isotopes when coupled with data that relates to ecosystem type. This study will examine the distribution of hydrogen isotopes of higher plant waxes across the western U.S. at key intervals of the Cenozoic to provide a snapshot of long-wavelength changes to topography and moisture sources from the Eocene to recent. These data demonstrate the utility of biomarker isotopes as a paleohydrologic/paleotopographic proxy and point to long-standing high topography over much of western U.S. throughout the Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, NASA has been committed to making our Earth Science data more useable and accessible, not only to the community of NASA science researchers, but also to the world-wide public research community. The data collected by NASA’s remote sensing instruments represent a significant public investment in research. NASA holds these data in a public trust to promote comprehensive, long-term Earth science research. The Earth Observing System Data & Information System (EOSDIS) was established to meet this goal. From the beginning, NASA employed a free, open and non-discriminatory data policy to maximize the global utilization of the products derived from NASA’s observational data and related analyses. EOSDIS is designed to ingest, process, archive, and distribute data in a multi-mission environment. The system supports a wide variety of Earth science disciplines, including cryosphere, land cover change, radiation budget, atmosphere dynamics and composition, as well as inter-disciplinary research, including global climate change.  A distributed architecture was adopted to ensure discipline-specific support for the science data, while also leveraging standards and establishing policies and tools to enable interdisciplinary research, and analysis across multiple instruments. Over the past 2 decades the EOSDIS has evolved substantially. Today’s EOSDIS is a tightly coupled, yet heterogeneous system designed to meet the requirements of a diverse user community. The system was scaled to expand to meet the ever-growing volume of data (currently ~10 petabytes), and the exponential increase in user demand that has occurred over the past 15 years. We will present how the EOSDIS has evolved to support the variety and volume of NASA’s Earth Science data.",

            "abstract": "Rapid changes due to anthropic interventions in high-altitude environments, such as the Altiplano region in South America, require new approaches to understand the connections between physical and biogeochemical processes. Alterations of the water quality linked to the river morphology can affect the ecosystems and human development in the long-term.\nThe future construction of a reservoir in the Lluta river, located in northern Chile, will change the spatial distribution of arsenic-rich sediments, which can have significant effects on the lower parts of the watershed.\nIn this investigation we develop a coupled numerical model to predict and evaluate the interactions between morphodynamic changes in the Lluta reservoir, and conditions that can potentially desorb arsenic from the sediments. Assuming that contaminants are mobilized under anaerobic conditions, we calculate the oxygen concentration within the sediments to study the interactions of the delta progradation with the potential arsenic release.\nThis work provides a framework for future studies aimed to analyze the complex connections between morphodynamics and water quality, when contaminant-rich sediments accumulate in a reservoir. The tool can also help to design effective risk management and remediation strategies in these extreme environments.\nResearch has been supported by Fondecyt grant 1130940 and CONICYT/FONDAP Grant 15110017",

            "abstract": "Frictional stick-slip is considered to be the mechanism of shallow earthquakes, in which elastic energy slowly accumulates and is released during dynamic failure. Frictional materials can fail via stick-slip or stable sliding. In the context of rate-and-state friction, the transition between these behaviors is a Hopf bifurcation. However, laboratory and field observations suggest that more complicated behavior occurs, manifested by a range of slip modes that include slow earthquakes and slow slip transients. In the laboratory, these behaviors arise in materials exhibiting two-state variable friction behavior, or in systems with more complex elastic coupling than 1D interactions for a spring and rigid slider.\nTo explore this problem, we conducted shearing tests on layers of quartz powder with a mean grain size of 10 µm in a double-direct-shear geometry. Elastic stiffness of the loading system was varied by changing the central forcing block and the applied normal stress. Experiments were run at room temperature under a controlled relative humidity of 100%. Shear loading velocity was fixed at 10 µm/s. We unloaded and reloaded the shear stress at fixed intervals during experiments to measure the aggregate system stiffness at multiple strains.\nFor more compliant systems we observe slow stick-slip behavior, with slip durations on the order of seconds. Stiffer loading systems exhibit linearly stable behavior, even to velocity perturbations of an order of magnitude. The critical stiffness boundary suggested by rate-and-state friction appears to be a good first order predictor of the system, but does not capture its behavior completely. Our observations suggest that the interplay between loading stiffness and friction constitutive properties can in some cases produce an extended transition between stable and unstable sliding as a function of net slip in a given experiment, including a regime of complex slip behavior with slow stick-slip. This transition is caused by systematic changes in both gouge layer stiffness and friction as a function of accumulated strain, possibly related to shear localization. Our results suggest that the behavior of tectonic faults may evolve with accumulated slip that drives changes in stiffness, its spatial distribution along the fault, and frictional parameters.",

            "abstract": "Western Anatolia is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, undergoing broad N-S extension associated with the rollback of the Aegean slab in the south. This region is characterized by high heat-flow, recent volcanism, and core-complex formation. We use >3500 receiver functions from a dense array of 47 stations located in western Turkey and dispersion data from a recent regional-scale, ambient noise tomography study to invert for shear-wave velocity as a function of depth. Using this technique, we obtain an unprecedented three-dimensional shear-wave velocity model that characterizes the crust of western Turkey.\nWe find a sharp Moho transition beneath much of western Anatolia, with crustal thickness varying from ~25 km near the Aegean Sea to ~35 km beneath the Fethiye Lobe correlating with the topography in western Turkey. The lower crust exhibits a relatively continuous ~10-15 km thick low shear-wave velocity layer (LVL) beneath most of western Anatolia, reaching velocities below 3.0 km/s in some places. The top of this LVL marks the lower boundary of crustal seismicity. These characteristics suggest that the lower crust in western Anatolia is behaving as a ductile solid, as seismic velocities in this range at lower crustal depths are indicative of the presence of fluids (possibly partial melts when considering the high heat-flow in the region). We propose that the lower crust in this region may be undergoing local crustal flow due to the N-S dominated stress regime, which led to the formation of the sharp, low-relief Moho observed in western Turkey.\nAcross the Fethiye-Burdur Fault Zone, we see the slowest S-wave velocities in the lower crust, reaching ~2.8 km/s. Unlike elsewhere in western Turkey, this region has relatively low surficial heat-flow and no recent volcanism. Therefore, the anomaly in the Fethiye Lobe is likely due to a different mechanism than western Turkey. We also observe a very slow uppermost mantle beneath this region, with shear-wave speeds < 4.2 km/s. We attribute this anomaly to subduction related processes, such as the introduction of aqueous fluids from the underthrusting of thick, hydrated sediments or alternatively, to possible serpentinization of the upper-mantle. Mantle wavespeeds transition to more typical velocities across the Fethiye-Burdur Fault Zone.",

            "abstract": "The patterns and processes influencing runoff generation are many and complex. In the northern Great Plains, threshold-like activation of infiltration-excess overland flow during spring snowmelt is common. However, the multiple controls on, and their hierarchy in determining, hydrological connectivity are poorly understood in space and time. Here we present analysis of a 52-year data set from three 5 ha runoff plots in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. We found that the key controls on the activation of snowmelt runoff are firstly snow water equivalent, followed by soil moisture in the preceding fall, and finally maximum depth of the surface thawed layer during snowmelt. Building on this analysis, we conducted a field experiment during the spring 2014 snowmelt period to assess these controls in high spatial and temporal detail. We found that soil moisture and thawed layer depth show little spatial variability during snowmelt, while the spatial patterns of snow water equivalent and snow cover ablation show time-varying hot spots of snowmelt. Catchment connectivity is determined by the topography of the soil surface, specifically the local micro-scale depressional area, volume and slope. Finally, we analyzed the stable isotope composition of soil water, snowmelt water from the base of the snowpack (both exhibiting high spatial variability) and hillslope runoff (with high temporal variability). This further illustrates how these time-varying controls on runoff generation are sequenced in an individual melt season, where filling and spilling of surface depressions over frozen ground dominates.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the development of a new generation of optical biogeochemical sensors coupled with increasingly widespread and relatively inexpensive data storage and transmission technology, has enabled watershed scientists to collect high-frequency water quality data that can be transmitted to researchers, managers and stakeholders in quasi real-time. However, the application of this technology to address regional water quality challenges across different types of land-use/cover is just being explored. Here we present the development of new regional water quality monitoring network in the northeastern United States (DE, RI,VT) - the North East Water Resources Network (NEWRnet). NEWRnet is used as a case study in the process associated with development and implementation of a regional, cross-state collaborative network for monitoring water quality; one of the first, we believe, of its kind. . Two fundamental questions that we address are: 1) What is the impact of climate variability and other disturbances on water quality for watersheds with different land uses extending across the north-south gradient (VT to DE)? 2) Do high-frequency water quality data provide valuable information and insights to stakeholders and thus lead to better and time efficient decision making? Our network consists of a suite of sites across each state with similar basic land covers (forested, agricultural and urban). Each site within the network is currently equipped with an s::can spectrolyser and YSI EXO2 sonde, as well as pressure transducers for estimating discharge and ISCO automated sampling systems. All sensor data is telemetered on an hourly basis from the monitoring site to a regional database housed at the University of Delaware, which is accessible to the entire research team In addition to university scientists and researchers, we also partner with local/state drinking water utilities (DWUs) to assess how this real-time water quality data can assist with their day-to-day operations and planning. We will present initial data from the network highlighting regional water quality responses to episodic events or “hot moments”. We also discuss challenges regarding regional data management, quality assurance and control, which are likely applicable to other similar networks under development.",

            "abstract": "Granitoid lithic clasts from the 0.7 ka Kaharoa eruption at the Tarawera volcano (Okataina Volcanic Complex, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand) – the world’s most productive region where rhyolite volcanism is currently active – give insight into the processes of rhyolite formation. The plutonic lithic clasts of the Kaharoa eruption consist of (1) quartz phenocrysts, which are often grouped into clusters of two to eight quartz grains, (2) plagioclase phenocrysts with anorthitic cores and albitic rims, and (3) interstitial potassium feldspar. Quartz orientations obtained through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) methods show that 78% of the 82 analyzed clusters have at least one pair of quartz grains with matched dipyramidal faces that are in either parallel or Esterel twin orientation. Variations in cathodoluminescence (CL) zoning patterns of the quartz suggest that quartz clusters in the plutonic lithics formed after initial crystal growth and that many quartz crystals were subject to one or more resorption events. Thus, individual quartz crystals with different magmatic histories came together into preferred orientations to form clusters; this process is indicative of oriented quartz synneusis and suggests a history of crystal accumulation. The quartz clusters are interpreted to have formed as part of a crystal cumulate mush within a shallow magma chamber where quartz crystals rotated into contact along their dipyramidal faces during hindered settling and/or compaction. Therefore, the preservation of oriented quartz clusters from the Kaharoa plutonic lithics provides direct evidence for synchronous, shallow pluton formation from a cumulate mush during active volcanism. This result is consistent with a model whereby melt-rich, high-silica rhyolite formation occurs via interstitial melt extraction from a low-silica rhyolite mush in the shallow crust.",

We present results from experiments in which a high concentration (50% by volume) of granular solids suspended in a non-Newtonian carrier fluid (0.75% guar gum in water) flowed through a transparent parallel-plate fracture. Digital particle-image-velocimetry analysis demonstrates the development of a strongly heterogeneous velocity field within the fracture that persists for the length of the fracture. The highest velocities were observed along the no-flow boundaries and the lowest velocities along the centerline; we carried out numerical simulations and additional experiments to elucidate this surprising result. Depth-averaged (2D) simulations using a rheological model of concentrated suspensions of mono-disperse solids in Newtonian fluids reproduced experimental observations of the velocity field when small (3%) variations in solid concentration were introduced. Such concentration variability led to significant (factor of two) velocity variations within the fracture yet negligible changes in observed pressure gradients. Two plausible explanations for solid-concentration variability are: (i) shearing of the fluid at the no-flow boundaries induced these concentration variations or (ii) they were induced by upstream boundary conditions. A second set of experiments was performed to identify which of the two phenomena caused the observed velocity variations. A narrow obstruction was placed along the centerline of the same cell; reduced velocities along the obstruction were observed, indicating that the observed velocity variations are the result of solid concentration heterogeneities that occurred in the upstream boundary and not from concentration heterogeneities developing inside the fracture. Our results suggest that small variations in solid concentration can lead to significant velocity variations such that a simple fracture-averaged conductivity may not reliably predict transport of suspended solids within fractures.",

            "abstract": "A key process for the formation of deltas and their fluvial networks is the deposition of mouth bars. Predicting mouth bar formation on marine coastlines is complex because of the interactions between waves, tides, vegetation, water and sediment discharge. In this work an analytical model for the hydrodynamic interaction between incoming waves and a turbulent expanding jet is developed and tested with the numerical model Delft3D coupled to the wave model SWAN. Both the analytical model and Delft3D predict that incoming surface gravity waves increase the spreading of the jet and the interaction between wave and current boundary layers causes an increase in bottom friction. Our numerical results show that in the presence of waves, mouth bars form up to 35% closer to the river mouth and 40% faster when compared to cases without waves. From a morphodynamic point of view, we show that wave characteristics (height, period and direction) play an important role in the formation of mouth bars. In our numerical experiments waves affect bar development in three ways: by modifying the direction of the river jet, by increasing bottom shear stresses at the river mouth, and by changing bottom friction and hence increasing jet spreading. In addition, we show that high waves with long period prevent the formation of mouth bars and therefore should be considered in the design of restoration schemes for deltaic land.",

            "abstract": "Global changes such as biological invasions and sea level rise can significantly affect GHG emissions from coastal wetlands by changing plant community composition and/or environmental conditions. To first characterize GHG fluxes across major plant-defined marsh zones, CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes were compared between S. patens- dominated high marsh and S. alterniflora low marsh during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons in 3 New England marshes. To test how these fluxes may change in response to biological invasions and sea level rise, GHG fluxes were then compared between native, P.australis- invaded, and permanently inundated marsh zones at these sites in 2013 and 2014. GHG emissions were analyzed simultaneously from marsh ecosystems using infrared-based spectrometers connected to static flux chambers. Daytime CO2 uptake rates (ranging on average between -2 and -21 μmol CO2 m-2s-1) were generally greater in S. alterniflora low marsh zones than in S. patens high marsh among all 3 sites. Methane fluxes were generally low in both native marsh zones (< 50 μmol CH4 m-2 h-1) and N2O emissions were rare. However, CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions from P. australis zones were typically more than an order of magnitude greater than those of either native marsh zone. In contrast, permanently inundated marsh soils had similar GHG emissions to native marsh zones. . Though large, the P. australis CH4 emissions are estimated to offset less than 5% of observed CO2 uptake rates based on a global warming potential of 25 (100 years). These results suggest that two alternative fates for coastal marshes in the future- conversion to P. australis marshes or to standing water with sea level rise- will substantially affect CO2 and CH4 emissions. Net impacts on climatic forcing of these ecosystems will depend on how long term C sequestration is affected as these emissions shift.",

This allows for (1) characterization of the mantle source(s) at Hess Deep, (2) insight into the extent of isotopic homogeneity or heterogeneity in the area, and (3) constrain the relative contributions from the intruding Cocos–Nazca spreading center.\nThe observed Pb–isotopic variation at Hess Deep covers almost the entire range of EPR MORB (10°N to –5°S). Hess Deep samples range from 208Pb (37.3–38.25), 207Pb (15.47–15.58), 206Pb (17.69–18.91). These compositions suggest that this part of Hess Deep mantle is no more isotopically homogeneous than EPR mantle. Two distinct arrays are also observed: 208Pb–enriched (r2=0.985; n=30) and 208Pb–depleted (r2=0.988; n=6). The 208Pb/204Pb isotopes indicates that the Pb–source for some of the samples at Hess Deep had very low Th/U ratios, whereas other areas around the Galapagos microplate seem to have more “normal” ratios. These trends are less apparent when viewed with 207Pb–isotopes. Instead, the majority of basalts and gabbros follow the NHRL, however, at the depleted–end of this array a negative excursion to more enriched compositions is observed. This negative but linear trend could signify an alteration trend or mixing with an EMI–type mantle source, yet this mixing is not observed with 208Pb. This trend is also observed at Pito Deep, which has similar origins to Hess Deep (Barker et al., 2008; Pollack et al., 2009).\nThe Galapagos region has been considered a testing ground for mixing of HIMU, Enriched Mantle, and Depleted Mantle reservoirs (e.g., Schilling et al., 2002). According to our data, however, an EPR–component must also be considered. We model Hess Deep Pb–isotopes as a 4–component system. EPR–DM–EM comprise a ‘local’ reservoir, but the majority of samples contain a mixture of modified-HIMU–EM–EPR, a product of incoming plume material entrained within the Galapagos Spreading Center.",

As a part of broadening the community beyond NASA-funded researchers, NASA through an agreement with Amazon Inc. made available to the public a large collection of Climate and Earth Sciences satellite data. The data, available through the Open NASA Earth Exchange (OpenNEX) platform hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud, consists of large amounts of global land surface imaging, vegetation conditions, climate observations and climate projections. In addition to the data, users of OpenNEX platform can also watch lectures from leading experts, learn basic access and use of the available data sets.\nIn order to advance White House initiatives such as Open Data, Big Data and Climate Data and the Climate Action Plan, NASA over the past six months conducted the OpenNEX Challenge. The two-part challenge was designed to engage the public in creating innovative ways to use NASA data and address climate change impacts on economic growth, health and livelihood. Our intention was that the challenges allow citizen scientists to realize the value of NASA data assets and offers NASA new ideas on how to share and use that data. The first “ideation” challenge, closed on July 31st attracted over 450 participants consisting of climate scientists, hobbyists, citizen scientists, IT experts and App developers. Winning ideas from the first challenge will be incorporated into the second “builder” challenge currently targeted to launch mid-August and close by mid-November. The winner(s) will be formally announced at AGU in December of 2014. We will share our experiences and lessons learned over the past year from OpenNEX, a public-private partnership for engaging and enabling a large community of citizen scientists to better understand global climate changes and in creating climate resilience.",

            "abstract": "There have been a number of multiple GCM-RCM programs, covering Europe, North America, and now, through CORDEX, most regions of the world. Standard metrics of success for these programs include number of publications, number of users of the data, and number of citations to the program. However, these metrics do not necessarily reflect the scientific value of the program, for example, what new scientific knowledge has been developed. We began to carefully consider how one does establish the scientific value of such programs. We thought that establishing the scientific value of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) would be a good way to examine this issue. We present in this paper our thinking so far on this issue and demonstrate how we are proceeding. We hope that our analysis will prove useful for explicitly establishing the value of such programs throughout the world. Perhaps the most direct indication of a program’s value is whether the goals set out for the program have been met. In the case of NARCCAP, this is relatively straightforward. We can point to the research papers published that quantify the uncertainty based on the global and regional climate simulations (e.g., Mearns et al., 2013), and we can point to the number of data users and the number of papers published by the impacts community using the NARCCAP data. Of particular interest, however, is determining what we have learned about future climate projections and their impacts based on the use of higher resolution dynamically generated future climate information. We evaluated all research articles and major reports that used the NARCCAP database, and we report in this talk the major research advances indicated in this literature.",

Stable isotope analysis of carbon reservoirs provides information about carbon cycling, allowing carbon to be tracked along groundwater flow paths from the surface atmosphere, through the soil and epikarst, and into caves and karst aquifers. In the Ozarks of northwestern Arkansas, karstified carbonates are covered with a mantle of cherty regolith, which can serve as either a sink or source of carbon. Samples for δ13C analysis of gaseous CO2 and aqueous DIC were collected from two soil lysimeters installed in the soil zone above a cave, a drip-water pool in a side-passage of the cave, and three locations along the cave stream and spring outlet. A two-component, concentration-dependent mixing model of δ13C-CO2 was used to calculate the proportions of cave-air CO2 sourced from the surface atmosphere versus the soil zone. Median CO2 concentrations were 2,578 ±1,504 ppm in the soil and 1,026 ±939 ppm in the cave, and CO2 concentration increased with outside surface temperature. Median δ13C-CO2 was -21.5 ±2.1 ‰ in the soil and -17.5 ±4.3 ‰ in the cave. Median DIC concentrations were 1.7 ±1.0 mg/L in the soil and 23.3 ±6.6 mg/L in the cave, and as discharge increased, DIC concentration decreased in the cave. Median δ13C-DIC was -19.5 ±2.5 ‰ in the soil and -14.3 ±1.6 ‰ in the cave. The concentration and isotopic composition of carbon species varied seasonally; for example, in the soil and cave, CO2 was greatest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Additionally, the proportion of soil CO2 contributing to the cave air was lowest during fall (8 %) and greatest during summer (71 %). At the spring outlet during storm events, DIC and calcite saturation decreased and δ13C-DIC became lighter, likely as pre-event water stored in the soil zone was displaced by storm-event water. Data indicate that, depending on the time of year, cave carbon species were sourced from the surface atmosphere, soil, and deeper groundwater flow paths.",

            "abstract": "Detrital minerals within the stratigraphic record provide key constraints for a range of geologic problems, including the first order tectonic setting of basins, structural histories within orogens, changes in climate, and major drainage network reorganizations. Numerous provenance techniques exist for linking detrital minerals to their source areas, but the majority of these methods share an underlying assumption that sediment delivered to a basin is a representative sample of the bedrock geology of the source area. Satisfying this assumption requires that sediment production rates, i.e. erosion rates, of a source area are uniform throughout. In detail, erosion rates within a source area vary as a function of patterns of landscape evolution dictated by rock erodibility, climate, and relative uplift rate, thus long-term and transient biasing of sediment provenance records is expected. Biases associated with landscape evolution in response to changes in climate, tectonics, or strength of exposed rock can last 10s Myr. Previous work recognized a potential influence of differential erosion on provenance records, but the relative importance of this effect has proven difficult to quantify with field data. To address this, we are using a modified version of the CHILD landscape evolution model (LEM), which supports numerous lithologies with different erodibilities within a landscape. We perform a sensitivity analysis on the relative influence of rock strength and changes in climate or uplift rate on provenance records. We focus on U-Pb detrital zircon records because these data have seen wide adoption as a provenance tool and the refractory nature of zircon makes them less likely to be influenced by chemical weathering effects that are beyond the scope of this work. We plan to test several scenarios including variations in rock erodibility and temporal changes in climate or uplift rate. We will then use results from the LEM to calculate erosion rates from different lithologies within the landscape and generate synthetic detrital zircon age spectra. We will quantify the potential strength of any biasing effects by comparing the results of models with differing erodibilities or transient changes in climate and uplift to steady-state cases with uniform erodibilities.",

This unique orbit geometry will bring Cassini closer than ever to the planet and has the potential of substantially improving our knowledge of Saturn's internal planetary magnetic field.

The lidar dataset, acquired for us by the US National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) and New Zealand Aerial Mapping (NZAM), comprises 254 km of fault-parallel imagery in 1.2-to-1.5-km-wide swaths. These high-resolution data have an average shot density of ≥12 shots/m2, and encompass the central Wairau, central and eastern Awatere, western and eastern Clarence, and eastern Hope fault segments. In this study, we focus on detailed measurements of small (3-25 m) and large (10s-100s of meters) geomorphic offsets at multiple sites along the central Wairau and eastern Hope faults. In addition to showing compilations of these offset observations, we present examples of the lidar data at several key study sites where offsets at multiple scales are discernable. The precise fault offsets we measure at these sites, combined with post-IR IRSL (225°C) single-grain K-feldspar dating of fluvial terrace sediments, will provide the basis for determining incremental slip rates on these faults at a range of latest Pleistocene to late Holocene timescales. This project is part of a broader effort to generate incremental slip rates and paleoearthquake ages from all four of the main faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System with the goal of further understanding how mechanically complementary faults work together to accommodate relative plate motions.",

            "abstract": "The design of seismic networks for the monitoring of induced seismicity is of critical importance. The recent introduction of regulations in various locations around the world (with more upcoming) has created a need for a priori confirmation that certain performance standards are met. We develop a tool to assess two key measures of network performance without an earthquake catalogue: magnitude of completeness and location accuracy. Site noise measurements are taken at existing seismic stations or as part of a noise survey. We then interpolate between measured values to determine a noise map for the entire region. The site noise is then summed with the instrument noise to determine the effective station noise at each of the proposed station locations. Location accuracy is evaluated by generating a covariance matrix that represents the error ellipsoid from the travel time derivatives (Peters and Crosson, 1972). To determine the magnitude of completeness we assume isotropic radiation and mandate a minimum signal to noise ratio for detection. For every gridpoint, we compute the Brune spectra for synthetic events and iterate to determine the smallest magnitude event that can be detected by at least four stations. We apply this methodology to an example network. We predict the magnitude of completeness and the location accuracy and compare the predicted values to observed values generated from the existing earthquake catalogue for the network. We discuss the effects of hypothetical station additions and removals on network performance to simulate network expansions and station failures. The ability to predict hypothetical station performance allows for the optimization of seismic network design and enables prediction of network performance even for a purely hypothetical seismic network. This allows the operators of networks for induced seismicity monitoring to be confident that performance criteria are met from day one of operations.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic and seismic studies over the past decade have revealed a wide range of slow earthquake phenomena including long- and short-term slow slip events (SSEs), non-volcanic tremor, low and very-low frequency earthquakes (LFEs, V-LFEs) in major subduction zones. Despite much progress, the physical mechanisms of SSEs and seismic slow earthquakes and how these phenomena relate to each other are still not clear. The Japanese GPS network (GEONET) with ~1450 stations provide a unique opportunity to study subduction zone dynamics and to understand these different faulting behaviors at various spatiotemporal scales. We extended our reanalysis of GPS position time series for the entire GEONET from 1996 to 2014 using JPL GIPSY/OASIS-II based GPS Network Processor and raw data provided by Geospatial Information Authority of Japan and Caltech. The reestimated JPL precise GPS orbits, GMF troposphere model, and single receiver phase ambiguity resolution strategy were used in the analysis. The resultant ~18 years position estimates show good consistency and reduced scattering over the entire time period compared to prior analysis. We perform a systematic time series analysis to identify and correct the offsets caused by earthquakes, instrument and other unknown sources. We image the spatiotemporal variation of slip transients and investigate how they interact with seismic slow earthquakes. Our application to recurrent long-term SSEs in Bungo Channel region shows these events share the similar spatial distribution with regard to interplate coupling model, consistent with their recurrent nature. The universal modulation of transient slip rate on downdip LFEs/tremors and their different spatial patterns and moment release suggest that they are not different manifestations of the same physical process. There is considerable difference in space-time details of these slip transients, indicating that these recurrent events are not identical. We find a clear difference in temporal correspondence between transient slip rate and up-dip V-LFEs, possibly reflecting different triggering mode from that of LFEs/tremors. The high quality of GPS position time series also help reveal much smaller events over the “quiet” inter-SSE period, showing that not all SSEs are accompanied by LFE/tremors.",

A more recent innovation has been the ability to create point clouds similar to those from LiDAR through photogrammetric Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. This newer technique, which we like to call Photogrammetric Detection and Ranging (PhoDAR), has huge potential for being able to collect data over a variety of terrain types. Here we present a case study of how PhoDAR compares with LiDAR and ground data in regards to forest canopy height modeling. Our results to this point have been promising and seem to indicate that PhoDAR could become a viable alternative or complementary technology to LiDAR.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing subsurface hydraulic properties is essential for predicting flow and transport, and thus, for making informed decisions, such as selection and execution of a groundwater remediation strategy; however, obtaining accurate estimates at the necessary resolution with quantified uncertainty is an ongoing challenge. For over a decade, the development of hydraulic tomography (HT) – i.e., conducting a series of discrete interval hydraulic tests, observing distributed pressure signals, and analyzing the data through inversion of all tests together – has shown promise as a subsurface imaging method. Numerical and laboratory 3-D HT studies have enhanced and validated such methodologies, but there have been far fewer 3-D field characterization studies.\nWe use 3-D transient hydraulic tomography (3-D THT) to characterize a highly heterogeneous unconfined alluvial aquifer at an active industrial site near Assemini, Italy. With 26 pumping tests conducted from 13 isolated vertical locations, and pressure responses measured at 63 spatial locations through five clusters of continuous multichannel tubing, we recorded over 800 drawdown curves during the field testing. Selected measurements from each curve were inverted in order to obtain an estimate of the distributed hydraulic conductivity field K(x) as well as uniform (“effective”) values of specific storage Ss and specific yield Sy. The estimated K values varied across seven orders of magnitude, suggesting that this is one of the most heterogeneous sites at which HT has ever been conducted. Furthermore, these results are validated using drawdown observations from seven independent tests with pumping performed at multiple locations other than the main pumping well. The validation results are encouraging, especially given the uncertain nature of the problem. Overall, this research demonstrates the ability of 3-D THT to provide high-resolution of structure and local K at a non-research site at the scale of a contaminant source zone.\nWe would like to especially thank Michael Cardiff, Carsten Leven, Francesco Chidichimo, and Riccardo Borella for their insightful and tireless efforts as part of the field campaign for this research.",

The aim of the application is to make climate model results more accessible and understandable to a wide range of users. The application is based on high resolution (~800 m) statistically downscaled climate projections (NEX-DCP30, RCP4.5 and 8.5, produced by NASA) from 30 of the CMIP5 GCMs. We used the climate data to drive a simple water balance model to provide additional insights into the potential for climate-driven change in surface hydrology. The application contains a robust set of tools for characterizing future climate change, including interactive maps, climographs, time series, data tables and downloadable summary reports for each region. The NCCV generally finds future temperature and evaporative demands increase, winter snowpack decreases and the timing of peak runoff is shifted earlier in the season, particularly in the Northeast and mountainous West.

            "abstract": "Soluble salt assemblages formed through aqueous processes are widespread on Mars. These minerals are important for understanding the past aqueous history of Mars and indicate critical habitability parameters such as pH, temperature, water activity, and salinity. Equilibrium models have been used to determine solution chemistry and salt precipitation sequences from aqueous chemical data; however, current models are limited by a lack of experimental data for low-temperature perchlorates, and some model predictions are clearly anomalous. To address the need for accurate equilibrium models, we have developed a comprehensive model for low-temperature perchlorate-rich brines using (1) previously neglected literature data, (2) experimental solubilities determined in low-temperature perchlorate solutions, and (3) solubility and heat capacity results determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Our resulting model is a significant improvement over existing models, such as FREZCHEM, particularly for perchlorate mixtures. We have applied our model to evaporation and freezing of a nominal Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) solution measured at the Phoenix site. For a freezing WCL solution, our model indicates that ice, KClO4, hydromagnesite (3MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·3H2O), calcite (CaCO3), meridianiite (MgSO4·11H2O), MgCl2·12H2O, NaClO4·2H2O, and Mg(ClO4)2·6H2O form at the eutectic (209 K); whereas, KClO4, hydromagnesite, kieserite (MgSO4·H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4), halite (NaCl), NaClO4·H2O, and Mg(ClO4)2·6H2O form upon complete evaporation at 298 K. In general, evaporation yields more dehydrated mineral assemblages than salts produced by freezing. Hydrated phases that form during evaporation contain 0.3 wt. % water, which compares with 1.2 wt. % during freezing. Given independent evidence for the presence of calcite and minimum water contents in Martian soils of ~1.5 wt. %, salts at the Phoenix site, and possibly elsewhere, appear more likely to have formed during freezing. Furthermore, our model indicates that some minerals, such as halite, kieserite, epsomite, and mirabilite (Na2SO4·10H2O) form only under limited temperature and water activity conditions, and could be used to constrain the past aqueous history of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Deuterium and oxygen-18, combined with noble gases and radioisotopes (e.g., 3H, 14C, 36Cl), are routinely used to infer climate during recharge and groundwater age. However, along flow paths on the order of 10 – 103 km long, groundwater velocities may be low enough to allow diffusion of 2H and 18O between a confined aquifer and bounding aquitards, which could alter isotope concentrations and the inferred temperature of recharge. While the need to account for 14C diffusion between aquifer waters and confining layers has been suggested by a prior model (Sudicky and Frind, 1981), a literature review revealed no similar study of stable water isotopes. Based on the geologic and hydraulic properties of the confined Wilcox aquifer in the middle Mississippi Valley, we are constructing a numerical model to determine whether, and to what degree, diffusion can influence 2H and 18O concentrations in regional aquifers with residence times on the order of 104 – 105 y. This model combines solutions for a 1D forward-in-time, finite-difference groundwater flow equation and a combined explicit-implicit, advection-diffusion Crank-Nicholson algorithm to solve for flow velocity and isotope concentration.",

            "abstract": "Charged ions and neutral atoms exchange electrons in many space plasma venues. Soft X-rays are emitted when highly charged solar wind ions, such as C6+, O7+, and Fe13+, interact with Hydrogen and Helium atoms. Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) are produced when solar wind protons encounter neutral atoms. Consequently ENA and soft x-ray images can be a powerful technique to probe remotely the plasma and neutral density structures created when the solar wind interacts with planetary exospheres, such as those at the Earth, Moon, Mars, Venus, and comets. Here, we use the OpenGGCM global magnetosphere-ionosphere MHD model and the Hodges model for the Earth’s exosphere to simulate both soft X-ray and ENA images of Earth's dayside cusps and magnetosheath in preparation for future mission planning. We consider several solar wind and IMF scenarios, such as a sudden increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure and southward IMF turning. We then predict the time-dependent variations in X-Ray and ENA images that would be observed by spacecraft far outside the magnetosphere. As expected, strong signals appear near to and define the positions of the bow shock, magnetopause, and cusps. The soft X-ray imager observes changes in the dayside system nearly instantaneously, while the ENA imager measures the changes later due to the finite travel time of ENAs from the dayside systems to the spacecraft location.",

            "abstract": "Several different classes of organic nitrogen compounds are produced when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are oxidized in the presence of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx). The peroxyacyl nitrates and organic nitrates are particularly important as they serve as temporary or permanent sinks for NOx. PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate, CH3C(O)O2NO2) is the most important NOx reservoir, and its eventual decomposition acts as a pathway by which NOx reaches the remote troposphere. The emissions from oil and gas extraction represent a new VOC regime that could change the local fate of NOx because the particular mix of VOCs emitted from oil and gas operations should favor PAN formation.\nWe present new PAN observations from Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO) for the period 11 July to 15 August. The observations were collected during the Colorado Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ). PAN was measured at ROMO with a custom built gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). At the time of submission, preliminary campaign mean and maximum PAN mixing ratios were 170 pptv and 1345 pptv respectively. Initial analyses of the data collected to date suggest that the maximum PAN mixing ratios at ROMO occurred on the afternoons of 22 and 23 July. Co-located measurements of VOCs on 22 July indicate that the elevated PAN coincided with elevated abundances light alkanes and other secondary species (O3 and alkyl nitrates). The ratio of i-pentane to n- pentane (≤1) indicates that this air mass was strongly impacted by oil and gas production operations.",

            "abstract": "The maximum force from ridge push available is about 5 TN/m, lower than that required by 2D and 3D numerical experiments to rift the lithosphere in the absence of magmatic input. We carry out 2D numerical experiments without any magmatic input to study the extensional force necessary to start a rift basin and to breakup a continent. We assume a range of initial temperature structure, crust and mantle initial thicknesses and composition. In a first step, we use velocity boundary conditions (1cm/yr) and we monitor the force necessary to breakup the continent. Results can be classified in two groups according to the amount of force needed to rift through time: (1) The initial force builds up rapidly to 12-20 TN/m within 0.4-1.0 Myr. This is followed by an exponential decrease due to early strain localization and lithospheric weakening. The force is < 5TN/m after 4.4-7.0 Myr of extension. Continental breakup occurs approximately 10 Myr after the onset of extension forming narrow conjugate margins. This group encompasses experiments with initial Tmoho < 650oC and crustal thicknesses ≤ 35 km, where crust and mantle deformation are coupled from the early stages of rifting. (2) The initial build-up is more discrete, from < 3 TN/m to 4-6.5 TN/m in the first 0.1 Myr, followed by a decrease to a nearly constant value of 3-5 TN/m from 0.4 Myr to 10 Myr, when strain starts localizing. The constant force through time reflects lithosphere strengthening and migration of the deformation. This rift migration forms a wide basin (> 250 km wide) that may evolve to form very asymmetric conjugate margins. Breakup occurs 18 Myr after the onset of rifting or later. This second group corresponds to experiments with initial Tmoho > 650 km and crustal thicknesses ≥ 35 km. High bending stresses result in upper crust brittle failure and on enhancement of lower crust lateral flow. Interaction between ductile failure in the lower crust and brittle failure in the upper crust controls the migration of the deformation. In a second step, we repeat the same experiments applying a constant extensional force ≤ 5 TN/m to test whether and how the limited ridge push force naturally available can rift and breakup a continent. We then compare our results to the evolution of aborted rifts and to along strike variations in rifted magins such as the South Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Web 2.0 technologies are useful resources for reaching out to larger stakeholder communities and involve them in policy making and planning efforts. While these technologies have been used in the past to support education and communication endeavors, we have developed a novel, web-based, interactive planning tool that involves the community in using science-based methods for the design of potential runoff management strategies on their landscape. The tool, Watershed REstoration using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of Resources (WRESTORE), uses a democratic voting process coupled with visualization interfaces, computational simulation and optimization models, and user modeling techniques to support a human-centered design approach. The tool can be used to engage diverse watershed stakeholders and landowners via the internet, thereby improving opportunities for outreach and collaborations. Users are able to (a) design multiple types of conservation practices at their field-scale catchment and at the entire watershed scale, (b) examine impacts and limitations of their decisions on their neighboring catchments and on the entire watershed, (c) compare alternatives via a cost-benefit analysis, (d) vote on their “favorite” designs based on their preferences and constraints, and (e) propose their “favorite” alternatives to policy makers and other stakeholders. In this presentation, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of WRESTORE for designing alternatives of conservation practices to reduce peak flows in a Midwestern watershed, present results on multiple approaches for engaging with larger communities, and discuss potential for future developments.",

            "abstract": "Surface water quality is a major concern in the Yahara watershed (YW) of southern Wisconsin, home to a thriving dairy industry, the city of Madison, and five highly valued lakes that are eutrophic. Despite management interventions to mitigate runoff, there has been no significant trend in P loading to the lakes since 1975. Increases in manure production and heavy rainfall events over this time period may have offset any effects of management. We developed a comprehensive, integrated modeling framework that can simulate the effects of multiple drivers on ecosystem services, including surface water quality. The framework includes process-based representation of terrestrial ecosystems (Agro-IBIS) and groundwater flow (MODFLOW), hydrologic routing of water and nutrients across the landscape (THMB), and assessment of lake water quality (YWQM). Biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic transport of P have been added to the framework to enable detailed simulation of P dynamics within the watershed, including interactions with climate and management. The P module features in-soil cycling of organic, inorganic, and labile forms of P; manure application, decomposition, and subsequent loss of dissolved P in runoff; loss of particulate-bound P with erosion; and transport of dissolved and particulate P within waterways. Model results will compare the effects of increased heavy rainfall events, increased manure production, and implementation of best management practices on P loads to the Yahara lakes.",

These \"synoptic\" maps (available from a number of ground-based and space-based solar observatories) are built up over a solar rotation. A well-known problem with this approach is that the maps contain data that is as much as 27 days old. The Sun's magnetic flux is always evolving, and these changes in the flux affect coronal and heliospheric structure. Flux evolution models can in principle provide a more accurate specification, by estimating the likely state of the photospheric magnetic field on unobserved portions of the Sun. The Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric flux Transport (ADAPT) model (Arge et al. 2010) is especially well suited for this purpose. ADAPT can also incorporate information from helioseismic acoustic images to estimate the emergence of new active regions on the Sun's far side.\nIn this presentation we describe MHD models with boundary conditions derived from ADAPT maps. We investigate the June-August 2010 time period, when there was significant coronal hole evolution observed by the STEREO and SDO spacecraft. We compare model results using ADAPT maps, including those with far side data, as well as models using traditional synoptic maps, to STEREO EUVI and SDO AIA data.\nResearch supported by AFOSR & NASA.",

Based on the literature and new three-dimensional laser scanning data acquired in the Alaskan Arctic, we revisited the existing classifications of snow forms, and suggest a new genetic classification. Next we compared the morphology of aeolian snow features to analogous sand features, and then investigated the processes responsible for the differences. Although previous studies have suggested close similitudes between sand and snow features (barchan dunes, transverse dunes, etc.), we find significant differences, including:\n1) snow features are smaller by a factor of a 100, 2) snow dunes are flatter, 3) snow dunes move four orders of magnitude faster than sand dunes, and 4) sand dunes last millennia, while snow dunes are by and large ephemeral. Coupling equations for dune age, propagation speed, snow flux, and wind speed, we find that the lower density of snow grains vs. sand (which should produce a higher flux) is balanced by sintering, which serves as a countdown timer, eventually bonding grains together, reducing material fluxes, and thereby limiting the growth and age of snow dunes.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission was successfully launched in February 2014. It is the next satellite mission to obtain global precipitation measurements following success of TRMM. The GPM core satellite is equipped with a dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) operating at Ku and Ka band. DPR is expected to improve our knowledge of precipitation. Profile classification module of GPM-DPR is a critical module in the retrieval system for space borne radar. It involves two aspects: 1) precipitation type classification;and 2) melting region detection. Dual-frequency classification method that has been implemented into DPR algorithm relies on the microphysical properties using the difference in measured radar reflectivities at two frequencies, a quantity often called the measured dual-frequency ratio (DFRm). There are two aspects that control DFRm vertical profile: a) the non-Rayleigh scattering; b) the path- integrated attenuation. The DFRm is determined by the forward and backscattering properties of the mixed phase and rain and the backscattering properties of the ice. It holds rich information to assist in precipitation type classification and melting layer detection. In order to quantify DFRm features, a set of indices are defined. V1=(DFRm_max-DFRm_min)/(DFRm_max+DFRm_min). Where DFRm_max and DFRm_min are DFRm local max and min values. V2 is the absolute value of the mean slope for DFRm below the DFRm local min point. To further enlarge the difference between rain types, a third DFRm index V3 is defined V3=V1/V2. V3 is an effective parameter and provides a separable threshold for different rain types. The criteria for the melting layer top is defined as the height at which the slope of the DFRm profile hits a peak value. Similarly, the melting layer bottom is defined as the height the DFRm profile has a local minimum value. These criteria show good comparisons with other existing criteria. Dual-frequency classification method has been evaluated using GPM DPR real data since it is available. Initial evaluation shows good comparison on rain type classification from both dual-frequency classification method and Ku only method at a statistical point of view. Reasonable comparison can also be seen from melting region detection.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric seismology is a new branch of geophysics aiming to study ionospheric response to such natural hazards as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcano eruptions. One of the very modern and exciting applications of the ionospheric seismology is the use of ionospheric measurements to determine parameters of seismic source and tsunamis, in addition to the “traditional” seismological measurements.\nIt is now experimentally proved that earthquakes with moment magnitudes Mw>6.8 are very much probable to cause ionospheric perturbations, referred to as co-seismic ionospheric disturbances (CID). The CID are usually N-shaped, in response to propagation of compression-rarefaction wave launched from the ground. Besides the primary waves generated directly by the co-seismic crustal displacements, it is possible to observe multi-mode CID propagation, especially in places with good instrumental coverage. These multiple modes are triggered and correspond to the surface Rayleigh waves (3.0-3.5 km/s), free gravity waves, tsunami propagation, etc. When the observations take place directly over the seismic fault regions, ionospheric measurements can help to obtain information on the dimensions on seismic fault and its location, as it was shown on the example of the Tohoku-oki earthquake (Astafyeva et al., JGR, DOI: 10.1002/jgra50556, 2013).\nThe next step toward the use of the ionospheric measurements for seismological purposes is to analyze resemblance in generation of tsunamis and CID. For this purpose, we analyze ionospheric response to strike-slip earthquakes that occurred in 2001-2013. We show that, unlike tsunamis, earthquakes with small vertical component of the co-seismic ground motion, can generate sufficiently large ionospheric perturbations. Therefore, independently on a focal mechanism, larger earthquakes generate larger ionospheric perturbations.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon is becoming a more commonly utilized tool for C cycling studies, as it helps constrain biotic ecosystem processes such as C turnover times and sources of production. However, for studies that focus on CO2, the sampling methods for Δ14CO2 (surface chambers and subsurface gas wells) can be affected by abiotic processes, which may bias results as a function of gas transport regime (diffusion and advection). The radiocarbon community currently uses a δ13C correction to account for mass-dependent fractionation, but to date this correction has not been validated for the soil gas environment, where atmospheric invasion and gas transport are important. This study used an analytical soil gas transport model across a range of soil diffusivities and production rates, in which we could control Δ14CO2 and δ13CO2 signatures of production and atmosphere. This synthetic situation allowed us to assess the bias that results from using the conventional correction method for estimating Δ14CO2 of soil production. We found that the conventional correction is not strictly valid in this setting for interpreting the signature of production and does not account for diffusion and atmospheric invasion. The resultant Δ14CO2 bias scales with soil diffusivity and production rates. We propose a new two-step correction for Δ14CO2 work in the soil environment that accounts for atmospheric invasion and the δ13CO2 correction, and is able to reproduce a true value of Δ14CO2 of production. This work not only assists in data interpretation, but also helps clarify a methodological window of opportunity for accurately measuring the Δ14CO2 of soil production using subsurface sampling.",

            "abstract": "Integrating geodetic data into seismic earthquake early warning (EEW) is critical for accurately resolving magnitude and finite fault dimensions in the very largest earthquakes (M>7). We have developed G-larmS, the Geodetic alarm System, as part of our efforts to incorporate geodetic data into EEW for Northern California. G-larmS is an extensible geodetic EEW infrastructure that analyzes positioning time series from real-time GPS processors, such as TrackRT or RTNET. It is currently running in an operational mode at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) where we use TrackRT to produce high sample rate displacement time series for 62 GPS stations in the greater San Francisco Bay Area with 3-4 second latency. We employ a fully triangulated network scheme, which provides resiliency against an outage or telemetry loss at any individual station, for a total of 165 basestation-rover pairs.\nG-larmS is tightly integrated into seismic alarm systems (CISN ShakeAlert, ElarmS) as it uses their P-wave detection alarms to trigger its own processing and sends warning messages back to the ShakeAlert decision module. Once triggered, G-larmS estimates the static offset at each station pair and inputs these into an inversion for fault slip, which is updated once per second. The software architecture and clear interface definitions of this Python implementation enable straightforward extensibility and exchange of specific algorithms that operate in the individual modules. For example, multiple modeling instances can be called in parallel, each of which applying a different strategy to infer fault and magnitude information (e.g., pre-defined fault planes, full grid search, least squares inversion, etc.). This design enables, for example, quick tests, expansion and algorithm comparisons.\nHere, we present the setup and report results of the first months of operation in Northern California. This includes analysis of system latencies, noise, and G-larmS’ response to actual events. We also test how differential positions over relatively short baselines (like those produced at the BSL) compare to absolute positions in the case of a very large earthquake. We perform this analysis using data from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake, add randomly selected real-time noise, and invert for slip along the subduction zone interface.",

            "abstract": "Metamorphic core complexes in the North American Cordillera are interpreted as sites of large–magnitude crustal extension, yet many aspects of their development remain controversial. Most core complexes in the central and southern Basin and Range are thought to have been exhumed by a single fault that evolved from ductile to brittle during the Miocene. However, new field relationships and U-Pb zircon geochronology from the lower plate of the Harcuvar core complex in western Arizona raise questions about the age and tectonic significance of mylonites in the evolution of this core complex.\nVariably mylonitic plutonic rocks dominate the lower plate. Plutonic units yield three major age populations. A foliated biotite granite yielded a U–Pb zircon age of 152 ± 3 Ma, and a gneiss with an E–W lineation yielded a similar 152 ± 4 Ma age, with some 179 ± 9 Ma cores. Leucogranite plutons and sills dominate much of the footwall and yield 71–72 Ma ages, with some inherited ~152 and ~180 Ma cores. A migmatitic biotite gneiss yielded younger U–Pb zircon ages of ~55 Ma and ~61 Ma with some ca. 1.4–1.5 Ga cores. Pegmatite dikes that cross–cut top-NE-directed mylonitic shear zones at high angles and are only weakly deformed also yield 55–64 Ma ages.\nThese results indicate that a phase of Middle to Late Jurassic magmatism was followed by a major magmatic event at ~72 Ma that emplaced large volumes of leucogranite. Minor melting (mainly pegmatites) continued until ca. 55 Ma. The pegmatites are likely late to post–tectonic and suggest that much of the lower plate mylonitization, including shearing related to top–NE extension, occurred during the Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary (Laramide) rather than the Miocene. Laramide extension may have been driven by Late Cretaceous crustal thickening and partial melting that weakened the crust and caused gravitational collapse. Thus, Miocene extension mainly occurred by brittle fault slip rather than widespread ductile shearing. These results raise questions about the time scales of core complex development and the role of tectonic inheritance in Miocene extension. U–Pb zircon and monazite geochronology currently in progress will further refine the timing of plutonic and metamorphic events and their role in the development of this core complex.",

The experimentally derived composition of the SRM can thus be compared to the certified (or otherwise accepted) value. This comparison gives a direct measure of the accuracy of the method used. Similarly, if the same SRM is analyzed as an unknown over multiple analytical sessions, the external reproducibility of the method can be evaluated.\nTwo common bulk digestion methods used in geochemical analysis are flux fusion and acid digestion. The flux fusion technique is excellent at ensuring complete digestion of a variety of sample types, is quick, and does not involve much use of hazardous acids. However, this technique is hampered by a high amount of total dissolved solids and may be accompanied by an increased analytical blank for certain trace elements. On the other hand, acid digestion (using a cocktail of concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids) provides an exceptionally clean digestion with very low analytical blanks. However, this technique results in a loss of Si from the system and may compromise results for a few other elements (e.g., Ge). Our lab uses flux fusion for the determination of major elements and a few key trace elements by ICP-ES, while acid digestion is used for Ti and trace element analyses by ICP-MS.\nHere we present major and trace element data for BHVO-2, a frequently used SRM derived from a Hawaiian basalt, gathered over a period of over two years (30+ analyses by each technique). We show that both digestion techniques are well suited to our applications and that it is possible to achieve a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility using a combination of these methods. For elements analyzed by both digestions and instruments, agreement is strong. Lastly, we recommend new and improved elemental concentrations for BHVO-2 based on our analyses and literature/database values.",

            "abstract": "Coseismic surface deformation is typically measured in the field by geologists and with a range of geophysical methods such as InSAR, LiDAR and GPS. Current methods, however, either fail to capture the near-field coseismic surface deformation pattern where vital information is needed, or lack pre-event data. We develop a standardized and reproducible methodology to fully constrain the surface, near-field, coseismic deformation pattern in high resolution using aerial photography.\nWe apply our methodology using the program COSI-corr to successfully cross-correlate pairs of aerial, optical imagery before and after the 1992, Mw 7.3 Landers and 1999, Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquakes. This technique allows measurement of the coseismic slip distribution and magnitude and width of off-fault deformation with sub-pixel precision. This technique can be applied in a cost effective manner for recent and historic earthquakes using archive aerial imagery.\nWe also use synthetic tests to constrain and correct for the bias imposed on the result due to use of a sliding window during correlation. Correcting for artificial smearing of the tectonic signal allows us to robustly measure the fault zone width along a surface rupture. Furthermore, the synthetic tests have constrained for the first time the measurement precision and accuracy of estimated fault displacements and fault-zone width. Our methodology provides the unique ability to robustly understand the kinematics of surface faulting while at the same time accounting for both off-fault deformation and measurement biases that typically complicates such data. For both earthquakes we find that our displacement measurements derived from cross-correlation are systematically larger than the field displacement measurements, indicating the presence of off-fault deformation. We show that the Landers and Hector Mine earthquake accommodated 46% and 38% of displacement away from the main primary rupture as off-fault deformation, over a mean deformation width of 183 m and 133 m, respectively. We envisage that correlation results derived from our methodology will provide vital data for near-field deformation patterns and will be of significant use for constraining inversion solutions for fault slip at depth.",

The experiment involves active- and passive-source seismology, magnetotellurics, and geochemistry/petrology. Seventy passive-source broadband seismometers were deployed in a 100-km-diameter array centered on MSH, with an average spacing of 10 km, and a planned duration of two years. The deployment over two weeks in June 2014 involved a group of 18 people split into 6 teams. Approximately half of the seismic stations have aircell batteries and/or pole-mounted solar panels in order to maintain power through deep snow at higher elevations during the winter months. Data will be retrieved 2-4 times a year throughout the duration of the experiment. The first service run performed in mid-July 2014 had a 98.4% data recovery. This is one of the largest wide-aperture two-dimensional arrays covering a volcano anywhere.\nThe active-source portion of the experiment successfully set off 23 shots in late-July 2014. These were recorded clearly at permanent stations run by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network up to 200 km away, and are expected to be well-recorded on many of the 70 broadband seismometers in addition to the 2500 Reftek “Texans” deployed temporarily for this purpose. For the 2-4 weeks of broadband data collected in July, local earthquakes down to magnitude 0 are recorded across the array, with clear P- and S- arrivals. Earthquakes of this size occur daily within 50 km of MSH. We are keeping a careful catalog of all activity in the region for the duration of the iMUSH experiment.\nWe will pick P- and S-wave travel times at the 70 broadband stations from local earthquakes and active shots, for available data from between June and October 2014. We will also use a tomographic code (Preston et al, 2003, Science) to invert the travel times to obtain preliminary earthquake location and 3-D velocity structure.",

Not only because data is knowledge, but it is often costly to acquire and is sometimes collected under unique circumstances. Another part of the science enterprise is the development of software to process and analyze the data. Developed software is also a large investment and worthy of preservation. However, the long term preservation of software presents some challenges. Software often requires a specific technology stack to operate. This can include software, operating systems and hardware dependencies. One past approach to preserve computational capabilities is to maintain ancient hardware long past its typical viability. On an archive horizon of 100 years, this is not feasible. Another approach to preserve computational capabilities is to archive source code. While this can preserve details of the implementation and algorithms, it may not be possible to reproduce the technology stack needed to compile and run the resulting applications. This future forward dilemma has a solution. Technology used to create clouds and process big data can also be used to archive and preserve computational capabilities. We explore how basic hardware, virtual machines, containers and appropriate metadata can be used to preserve computational capabilities and to archive functional software systems. In conjunction with data archives, this provides scientist with both the data and capability to reproduce the processing and analysis used to generate past scientific results.",

In order to obtain freshly soot particles emitted by home-made wood-burning cook stoves, copper grids for Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) were placed on the last two of an 8-stages MOUDI cascade impactor. The analysis of HRTEM micrographs revealed the nanostructure and the particle size of soot particles. The XPS survey spectra show a large carbon peak around 285 eV and the oxygen signal at 533 eV. Some differences observed in the carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio of the particles probably depend on the combustion process efficiency of each cook-stove analyzed. The C-1s XPS spectra show an asymmetric broad peak and other with low intensity that corresponds to sp2 and sp3hybridization, which were fitted with a convolution using Gaussian functions. Elastic backscattering technique allows a chemical elemental analysis of samples and confirms the presence of C, O and Si observed by XPS.\nAdditionally, the morphological properties of soot aggregates were analyzed calculating the border-based fractal dimension (Df). Particles exhibit complex shapes with high values of Df. Also, real-time absorption (σabs) and scattering (σsct) coefficients of fine (with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm) soot particles were measured. The trend in σabs and σsct indicate that the cooking process has two important combustion stages which varied in its flaming strength, being vigorous in the first stage and soft in the second one.",

            "abstract": "The competition between diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and advective transport in valleys sets fundamental spatial and temporal landscape scales, including ridge-valley spacing and landscape response time. However, the interactions between hillslopes and channels are difficult to measure in natural landscapes, due to long timescales and confounding climatic and lithologic factors. Laboratory experiments allow us to observe complex sediment dynamics in a controlled setting, but past work on erosive landscapes does not include diffusive hillslopes and hence cannot provide insight into channel-hillslope interactions. Here, we present the first results from a novel laboratory experiment combining hillslope diffusion and valley advection. Our experimental apparatus, the eXperimental Landscape Modeling (XLM) facility at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, consists of a 0.5 m x 0.5 m test flume filled with crystalline silica (D50 = 30μ) mixed with water, a high-resolution laser scanner to measure topography, and a series of load cells to measure sediment flux. Baselevel lowering is simulated by dropping two motorized weirs. During each run, we alternated between: (1) advective transport induced by a series of misting nozzles, where drops are not large enough to disturb sediment on impact, and (2) diffusive rainsplash transport driven by a constant head drip tray. We report a series of experiments where the relative strength of advection and diffusion are varied systematically between runs, testing theoretical predictions that dominantly diffusive landscapes will have larger ridge-valley spacing and respond more slowly to perturbations in baselevel. Our work provides an invaluable dataset for both testing numerical models of landscape evolution and guiding field investigations of channel-hillslope interactions.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is an important nutrient that contributes to eutrophication of water bodies and plays a key role in various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes. Thus, understanding the amounts and timing of N inputs from watersheds to aquatic ecosystems is critical. Most research to date has focused on the dissolved forms (< 0.45 micron) of N such as nitrate-N and organic N, which constitute a major portion of the N flux during baseflow and small to moderate storm events. The amounts of particulate N (PN > 0.45 micron) in runoff, can however, increase dramatically with large storms such as those associated with tropical depressions and hurricanes and can have a lasting impact on downstream aquatic systems. We determined the exports and storm-event patterns of PN for two (12 and 79 ha) intensively instrumented, headwater, forested, catchments located in the Piedmont Region of Maryland. Stream runoff sampling has been performed for baseflow and storm events since 2011 and has included numerous large tropical storms including Irene (2011) and Sandy (2012). Key questions that we address are: How significant is the PN flux, i.e., what proportion of the annual N is exported as PN during the large tropical events? How does PN export vary with storm magnitude? How do PN exports change with catchment scale? What are the temporal patterns of dissolved and particulate N species during the largest storms? Observations for tropical storm Irene (2011) revealed that in just 59 hours this storm contributed to one-third of the annual (2011) N flux from the 12 ha watershed and 87% of this N was in particulate form. A large portion of this particulate N is likely deposited in the fluvial network, especially in headwater reaches, and could potentially become bioavailable. Understanding these contributions from large events is especially important considering that climate-change scenarios indicate increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and thus potentially a greater role for PN in watershed N fluxes and cycling. This study will also enhance our ability to develop better management practices and decision tools to regulate N exports from watersheds.",

Inversions of seismic and tsunami waveforms indicate little or no megathrust slip near Unalaska in 1957, leading some to designate the region as a seismic gap. In the absence of a long seismic record, inundation modeling validated by geologic evidence for tsunami inundation provide constraints on rupture parameters of tsunamigenic earthquakes. Parameters such as magnitude and slip distribution have broad uncertainties, but are very important in furthering earthquake and tsunami hazard assessments. Field investigations at Stardust Bay on Sedanka Island (near the eastern end of Unalaska) identified a sequence of six paleotsunami deposits over the last 1770 years that inundated up to 18.5 m above sea level, the youngest deposit probably records the tsunami generated by the 1957 earthquake. Tsunami inundation scenarios, modeled in GeoCLAW (simulating tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation) and using published sources of the 1957 tsunami cannot account for the tsunami deposit runup observed at Stardust Bay. Inundation scenarios that used a variety of alternative hypothetical earthquake sources suggest that at least a part of the Unalaska gap must rupture to agree with paleotsunami deposits. Scenarios modeled using a non-uniform slip distribution on the fault consistent with updip strengthening had significantly higher runup compared to scenarios that used a uniform slip distribution. By modeling a variety of non-uniform slip-distributions on a fault representing the subduction zone spanning the Unalaska Gap, we are trying to determine the minimum amount of slip that results in the observed deposit runup. The slip distribution used for the preferred 1957 tsunami scenario [that best fits the 1957 deposit data] provides an estimate of the minimum average slip of the tsunami source. Coupling the inundation model with a forward sediment transport model might reveal relative tsunami magnitudes for each deposit observed in Stardust Bay.",

Thousands of years under intense human exploitation in this region, involving cutting, livestock grazing, agricultural practice and fire have resulted in severe degradation of these water limited ecosystems. The highly degraded state of the native vegetation as found by the new settlers coming to Israel in the beginning of the previous century, has provided the basic motivation for an extensive afforestation enterprise carried out during the last 100 years. This talk will present an overview on the accumulating experience in establishing and managing multifunctional forests in this dryland region. Given their very limited timber value, dryland forests are designed and managed under various goals the important of which are landscape aesthetics, recreation opportunities, grazing land, ecosystem restoration and soil conservation. Being subjected to water scarcity of high temporal and spatial variation, these manmade systems are managed to withstand water deficiency of unpredictable magnitude through the manipulation of both water input and water consumption. In the dry subhumid regions, forest management focuses mainly on controlling water consumption through the manipulation of vegetation structure using thinning and livestock grazing as primary silvicultural tools. Going into the semiarid zone, practices of rainfall redistribution and runoff harvesting become crucial for tree establishment and growth. The implementation of these practices varies depending on topography, rainfall amount and forest goals. The talk will provide a brief description of these unique silvicultural systems, review some of the recent scientific work in them and refer to critical gaps in knowledge. The relevancy to intercrop agroforestry in rainfed ecosystems will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Successful development of chemical profiles that link soil carbon vulnerability and resilience to climate change would greatly facilitate assessment of soil ecosystems response to global climate change. Additionally these signatures could be used to support the design of sustainable agricultural and food/energy crop security practices. We test this possibility using soils obtained from a 17-year reciprocal soil transplant experiment between two elevations in the arid environment of eastern Washington [1]. 30-cm diameter soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between the upper and lower sites. Cores were also transplanted in place to control for disturbance. Extracted subcores were incubated in environmental chambers and measured microbial respiration revealed statically a significant decrease in respiratory response as a function of temperature in cores transferred from low elevation to high elevation. We use ultra high resolution mass spectrometry to identify thousands of organic molecules and changes in geochemistry that would indicate the vulnerability of the soil ecosystem to climate perturbation. In our experiments we used methanol extraction followed by direct injection to 12 T ESI FT-ICR MS to identify about 4000 of individual compounds in about 200 mg soils at sub ppm mass accuracy. Chemical formulae were assigned to approximately 65% of the measured peaks using a modified Kujawinski pipeline and second order Kendrick transformations [2] resulted in approximately 75% assigned peaks.\nOur preliminary analysis finds that while the bulk C content of soils from the cooler, wetter conditions at the upper elevation is approximately twice that of the warmer, drier conditions at lower elevation, the molecular soil geochemistry is remarkably similar. Detailed analysis reveals subtle differences in the lipid, carbohydrate, and condensed hydrocarbon compositional makeup of the soil. Additionally, of the more than 17,000 individual compounds identified approximately 50% contain N which is atypical geochemistry of soil obtained from other ecosystems.\n1.

            "abstract": "While until recently marsh loss was largely thought to be due to an inability for vertical accretion rates to match rates of sea level rise, marsh edge erosion by wind waves is now thought to be the leading cause of marsh loss worldwide. To better understand the response of coastal ecosystems to future changes in sea level and storm intensity, we further develop the coupled barrier-island marsh evolution model GEOMBEST+. We use the relationship between wave height (and therefore energy) and fetch and wind speed to add marsh edge erosion to the model, as well as to provide a more physical formulation for bay bottom erosion. Previous research addressing marshes in isolation from barrier islands (Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013) suggests that the existence of a backbarrier marsh is an unstable state, tending to either grow laterally to completely fill an adjacent basin or to erode away completely. Previous results of GEOMBEST+ experiments (Walters et al., in review) suggest that couplings with an adjacent barrier island can add an additional alternate long-lasting state: a narrow marsh supported by sediment influx from overwash. Here we present the results of new GEOMBEST+ model experiments that address how the addition of lateral erosion by wind waves affects the existence and characteristics of the narrow marsh state. Specifically, we seek to address how the frequency and characteristic time and space scales of the narrow march state are affected. Model experiments also explore more broadly the importance of wind wave effects in understanding the coupled dynamics of marsh-barrier island systems.",

            "abstract": "We analyze newly acquired lidar high-resolution digital topographic data to measure offset geomorphic markers along the Awatere and Clarence faults in the Marlborough Fault System, northern South Island, New Zealand. With an average shot density of ≥ 12 shots/m2, these lidar data, which were acquired for us by the US National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) and New Zealand Aerial Mapping, offer a uniquely detailed view of the topography along ~90 km of the Awatere fault and ~160 km of the Clarence fault, allowing us to measure geomorphic offsets ranging in size from ~1 m to 100s of meters. In this specific study, we examine offset river terraces at the well-known Saxton River site on the Awatere fault, and at Tophouse Road on the Clarence fault. By constraining the ages of those river terraces using post-IR IRSL (225 °C) single-grain K-feldspar dating protocols, we determine latest Pleistocene to late-Holocene slip histories of the Awatere and Clarence faults at those locations. This project is part of a broader effort to generate incremental slip rates and paleoearthquake ages from the four main faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System with the goal of further understanding how mechanically complementary faults work together to accommodate relative plate motions.",

            "abstract": "Jeffreys Ledge, located ~50 km off the coast of New Hampshire, USA, is a major physiographic feature in the western Gulf of Maine (WGOM), extending over 100 km along its axis, while generally only being 5 to 10 km in width (~20 km maximum). The feature rises over 200 m from nearby basins to depths less than 50 m on the ridge surface. A major field campaign was undertaken at Jeffreys Ledge and adjacent areas in order to assess the roles of glaciation, sea-level fluctuations, and marine processes on the development of the major depositional environments. The study focused on an ~500 sq km area that extended from the shallowest reaches to the deep adjacent basins utilizing high resolution multibeam echosounder bathymetry (synthesized and gridded at the highest possible resolution), subbottom seismics, videography, and bottom sediment sampling. Due to the coarseness of the sediments composing the surface of Jeffreys Ledge (which frequently included cobbles and boulders), direct sampling was largely limited. Therefore, a descriptive seafloor classification utilizing video was developed and applied. The seafloor on Jeffreys Ledge typically ranges from sandy pebble gravel to pebble cobble gravel with boulders. Major glacial features include several boulder ridges ~ 5m in elevation that extend kms in length. These ridges, which run roughly parallel to the axis of Jeffreys Ledge, likely reflect winnowed recessional moraines. Smaller, asymmetric linear ridges with varying orientations are found on the western (landward) boundary. Although the origin of these features are unknown, they are believed to be relict glacial features as well. On the seaward (east) edge of the platform facing the open Gulf of Maine is a relatively smooth, sandy bathymetric high that likely was formed by wave processes during the last sea-level low stand. Subbottom seismics show evidence of soft sediment faulting and slumping on the flanks of the ridge and in the adjacent muddy basins. The use of high resolution bathymetry, along with the subbottom seismics, video, and direct sampling, reveal features not previously identified aiding our understanding of the development and controls on the major depositional environments.",

This study provides a quantitative analysis of precipitation associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the equatorial northern Pacific. Results from 31 CMIP5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) Global Circulation Model (GCM) runs and their historical ocean-coupled counterparts are compared with Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations. Differences found between the GCMs and observations are quantitatively analyzed using two innovative feature-based approaches with the intent of separating these discrepancies in the precipitation fields into components of magnitude-based error due to parameterizations, and location-based error due to large scale dynamics. Results show widespread and varied results across all GCMs, with some models showing large under/over-simulation of precipitation magnitude while other models suffer from significant pole-ward or equator-ward position shift of the ITCZ. Linkage between these results with the models' deep/convective and shallow/stratiform parameterizations are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) has been functioning and capturing measurements since the mid 1990s during the very successful Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) project. Unfortunately, in the current environment, some 20 years after the end of the TOGA project, sustaining the observing system is proving difficult. With the many advances in methods of observing the ocean, a group of scientists is taking a fresh look at what the Tropical Pacific Observing System requires for sustainability. This includes utilizing a wide variety of observing system platforms, including Argo floats, unmanned drifters, moorings, ships, etc.\nThis variety of platforms measuring ocean data also provides a significant challenge in terms of integrated data management. It is recognized that data and information management is crucial to the success and impact of any observing system. In order to be successful, it is also crucial to avoid building stovepipes for data management. To that end, NOAA’s Observing System Monitoring Center (OSMC) has been tasked to create a testbed of integrated real time and delayed mode observations for the Tropical Pacific region in support of the TPOS. The observing networks included in the prototype are: Argo floats, OceanSites moorings, drifting buoys, hydrographic surveys, underway carbon observations and, of course, real time ocean measurements.\nIn this presentation, we will discuss how the OSMC project is building the integrated data prototype using existing free and open source software. We will explore how we are leveraging successful data management frameworks pioneered by efforts such as NOAA’s Unified Access Framework project. We will also show examples of how conforming to well known conventions and standards allows for discoverability, usability and interoperability of data.",

Our results show that PMC frequency highly correlates with planetary wave activity in the NH stratosphere as well as surface temperatures in central and eastern states in the US.

            "abstract": "The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform is a collaborative software development project involving geoscientists, earthquake engineers, graduate students, and the SCEC Community Modeling Environment. The SCEC Broadband Platform (BBP) is open-source scientific software that can generate broadband (0-100Hz) ground motions for earthquakes, integrating complex scientific modules that implement rupture generation, low and high-frequency seismogram synthesis, non-linear site effects calculation, and visualization into a software system that supports easy on-demand computation of seismograms.\nThe Broadband Platform operates in two primary modes: validation simulations and scenario simulations. In validation mode, the Platform runs earthquake rupture and wave propagation modeling software to calculate seismograms for a well-observed historical earthquake. Then, the BBP calculates a number of goodness of fit measurements that quantify how well the model-based broadband seismograms match the observed seismograms for a certain event. Based on these results, the Platform can be used to tune and validate different numerical modeling techniques.\nIn scenario mode, the Broadband Platform can run simulations for hypothetical (scenario) earthquakes. In this mode, users input an earthquake description, a list of station names and locations, and a 1D velocity model for their region of interest, and the Broadband Platform software then calculates ground motions for the specified stations.\nWorking in close collaboration with scientists and research engineers, the SCEC software development group continues to add new capabilities to the Broadband Platform and to release new versions as open-source scientific software distributions that can be compiled and run on many Linux computer systems. Our latest release includes 5 simulation methods, 7 simulation regions covering California, Japan, and Eastern North America, the ability to compare simulation results against GMPEs, and several new data products, such as map and distance-based goodness of fit plots. As the number and complexity of scenarios simulated using the Broadband Platform increases, we have added batching utilities to substantially improve support for running large-scale simulations on computing clusters.",

            "abstract": "Research on deep-sea corals has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, as scientists began to realize their value as long-lived structural components of high biodiversity habitats and archives of environmental information. The NOAA Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program’s National Database for Deep-Sea Corals and Sponges is a comprehensive resource for georeferenced data on these organisms in U.S. waters. The National Database currently includes more than 220,000 deep-sea coral records representing approximately 880 unique species. Database records from museum archives, commercial and scientific bycatch, and from journal publications provide baseline information with relatively coarse spatial resolution dating back as far as 1842. These data are complemented by modern, in-situ submersible observations with high spatial resolution, from surveys conducted by NOAA and NOAA partners.\nManagement of high volumes of modern high-resolution observational data can be challenging. NOAA is working with our data partners to incorporate this occurrence data into the National Database, along with images and associated information related to geoposition, time, biology, taxonomy, environment, provenance, and accuracy. NOAA is also working to link associated datasets collected by our program’s research, to properly archive them to the NOAA National Data Centers, to build a robust metadata record, and to establish a standard protocol to simplify the process.\nAccess to the National Database is provided through an online mapping portal. The map displays point based records from the database. Records can be refined by taxon, region, time, and depth. The queries and extent used to view the map can also be used to download subsets of the database. The database, map, and website is already in use by NOAA, regional fishery management councils, and regional ocean planning bodies, but we envision it as a model that can expand to accommodate data on a global scale.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between fault zones and hydrogeological domains are an open challenge and require the understanding of the complex relationship between structure, fluid flow and hydrothermal transport and processes. Faults stimulate hydraulic conductivity when acting as conduit, but it can also be a barrier by mineral precipitation and comminution. Structural heterogeneity of fractured lithology induces a flow partition within the aquifer system creating preferential flows paths and some fracture connectivity. We propose an interdisciplinary approach from hydrogeological and structural point of view, in a low-enthalpy aquifer system in the central valley of Central Chile, where several low-temperature thermal springs are spatially related to regional long-lived fault zone (Pocuro Fault Zone). Pocuro Fault zone is a kilometric NS-striking steeply dipping fault zone, with at least 50 km long. Metric wide fault core includes gouge and cataclastic rocks, whereas decametric damage zone consists of intensely fractured and hydrothermal altered Meso-Cenozoic volcanic and volcaniclastic host rocks, crossed by centimetric to milimetric subvertical NE-striking veins. Preliminary results of vein infill clays minerals and zeolites from damage zone, suggest P-T conditions interpreted as an exhumed fossil high-temperature (120º-230ºC) geothermal system. Currently, only low-temperature thermal springs are discharging with different geochemical patterns (bicarbonate to chlorine and sulphate dominant ions) and a homogeneous temperature range (20º-25ºC). This is an interesting study case, to better understand the permeability evolution of geothermal system and the link between internal fault architecture, hydrogeology and hydrothermal inputs.",

            "abstract": "Ferric iron (Fe(III)) and humic substances (HS) are important terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration in wet tundra soils of the Arctic Coastal Plain near Barrow, Alaska. These soils are rich in both solid phase Fe minerals (including oxides such as ferrihydrite and goethite and other minerals with reduced or mixed valence such as siderite and magnetite) and soluble Fe, chelated by siderophores and other small organic molecules. This latter pool may also include nanocolloidal Fe: extremely fine-grained minerals that pass through a 0.2 micron filter. Both the solid phase and aqueous Fe pools undergo seasonal changes in redox state as a result of biological reduction by Fe-reducing microorganisms and oxidation by a variety of potential mechanisms, both abiotic and biotic. These redox cycles of solid and aqueous pools are not in phase: solid phase Fe became progressively more reduced from mid- to late summer, while aqueous phase Fe became reduced over the first half of the summer. It is well-known that HS interact with Fe, and that HS can act as electron shuttles in the reduction of Fe oxides. In other ecosystems chelated Fe(III) has been incubated with soil samples and the resulting Fe(II) produced is used as an indicator of the reducing power of HS. In these Fe-rich Arctic soils, HS are continuously in contact with chelated Fe, and therefore we interpret the redox state of this pool as an indicator of HS redox status. To verify this we conducted redox titrations of extracted HS with both reduced and oxidized Fe chelates and showed that chelated Fe could interact with HS both as electron acceptor and donator. In a field experiment, the addition of oxidized humic acids to soils resulted in an immediate oxidation of the aqueous Fe pool within 24 hours, which we attribute to abiotic oxidation of Fe by HS, followed by a slow reduction of this pool over the next week, presumably due to biological Fe reduction of the HS/aqueous Fe pool. At the end of summer 2010, both the solid-phase and aqueous Fe pools were in a mostly reduced state. At the beginning of summer 2011, the solid phase Fe pool was unchanged but aqueous Fe was re-oxidized. Several mechanisms for the reoxidation of the HS/aqueous Fe pool during the shoulder seasons and/or winter will be explored.",

            "abstract": "Wildland fire is a primary threat to watersheds that can impact water supply through increased sedimentation, water quality decline, and change the timing and amount of runoff leading to increased risk from flood and sediment natural hazards. It is of great societal importance in the western USA and throughout the world to improve understanding of how changing fire frequency, extent, and location, in conjunction with fuel treatments will affect watersheds and the ecosystem services they supply to communities. In this work we assess the utility of the InVEST Sediment Retention Model to accurately characterize vulnerability of burned watersheds to erosion and sedimentation. The InVEST tools are GIS-based implementations of common process models, engineered for high-end computing to allow the faster simulation of larger landscapes and incorporation into decision-making. The InVEST Sediment Retention Model is based on common soil erosion models (e.g., RUSLE –Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and determines which areas of the landscape contribute the greatest sediment loads to a hydrological network and conversely evaluate the ecosystem service of sediment retention on a watershed basis. We evaluate the accuracy and uncertainties for InVEST predictions of increased sedimentation after fire, using measured post-fire sedimentation rates available for many watersheds in different rainfall regimes throughout the western USA from an existing, large USGS database of post-fire sediment yield [synthesized in Moody J, Martin D (2009) Synthesis of sediment yields after wildland fire in different rainfall regimes in the western United States. International Journal of Wildland Fire 18: 96‐115]. The ultimate goal of this work is to calibrate and implement the model to accurately predict variability in post-fire sediment yield as a function of future landscape heterogeneity predicted by wildfire simulations, and future landscape fuel treatment scenarios, within watersheds.",

            "abstract": "This paper will discuss a new NSF-INSPIRE project that brings together research conducted in the fields of Ocean Sciences, Education & Human Resources and Computer and Information Science & Engineering. Specifically, our objective is to investigate new methods by which telepresence can be used to conduct cutting edge research and provide authentic educational experiences to undergraduate students, remotely. We choose to conduct this research in an Oceanographic context for two reasons: first with the move toward smaller research ships in the national Oceanographic research fleet, we anticipate that access to berth space at sea will continue to be at a premium. Any component of traditional oceanographic research that can be ported to shore without loss of effectiveness would be of immediate benefit to the Ocean Sciences. Equally, however, we argue that any improvements to work place and/or education practices that we can identify while delivering research and education from the bottom of the deep ocean should be readily mappable to any other scientific or engineering activities that seek to make use of telepresence in less extreme remote environments. Work on our TREET project, to-date, has included recruitment of 6 early career scientists keen to take advantage of the research opportunity provided, together with two senior science mentors with experience using Telepresence and a cohort of undergraduate students at three of the ECS partner Universities, spanning 4 time zones across the continental US. Following a 12-week synchronous on-line seminar series taught in Spring-Summer 2014, the entire team joined together at the Inner Space Center in Sept-Oct 2014 to participate, virtually, in a cruise of research and exploration to the Kick’Em Jenny underwater volcano and adjacent cold seep sites, conducted by the Ocean Exploration Trust’s ROV Hercules aboard the Exploration Vessel Nautilus. Our presentation will include preliminary results from that cruise.",

            "abstract": "At mid-ocean ridges magmatic, hydrothermal, and tectonic processes are linked. Understanding their interactions requires mapping magmatic systems and tectonic structures, as well as their relationship to hydrothermal circulation. Three-dimensional seismic images of the crust can be used to infer the size, shape, and location of magma reservoirs, in addition to the structure of the thermal boundary layer that connects magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Travel time tomography has often been used to study these processes, however, the spatial resolution of travel time tomography is limited.\nThree-dimensional full waveform inversion (FWI) is a state-of-the art seismic method developed for use in the oil industry to obtain high-resolution models of the velocity structure. The primary advantage of FWI is that it has the potential to resolve subsurface structures on the order of half the seismic wavelength—a significant improvement on conventional travel time tomography. Here, we apply anisotropic FWI to data collected on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Starting models for anisotropic P-wave velocity were obtained by travel time tomography [Weekly et al., 2014]. During FWI, the isotropic velocity model is updated and anisotropy is held constant.\nWe have recovered low-velocity zones approximately 2-3 km beneath the ridge axis that likely correspond to a segmented magma-rich body and are in concert with those previously resolved using multi-channel seismic reflection methods. The segmented crustal magma body underlies all five known high-temperature hydrothermal vent fields along the Endeavour segment. A high-velocity zone, shallower than the observed low-velocity zones, underlies the southernmost hydrothermal vent field. This may be indicative of waning hydrothermal activity in which minerals are crystallizing beneath the vent field. Our FWI study of the Endeavour Ridge will provide the most detailed three-dimensional images of the crustal structure to date over a spreading center.",

            "abstract": "Near-surface ozone in the western US can be sensitive to transported background pollutants from the free troposphere over the eastern Pacific, as well as various local emissions sources. Accurately estimating ozone source contributions in this region has strong policy-relevant significance as the air quality standards tend to go down. Here we improve modeled contributions from local and non-local sources to western US ozone base on the HTAP2 (Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution) multi-model experiment, along with multi-scale chemical data assimilation. We simulate western US air quality using the STEM regional model on a 12 km horizontal resolution grid, during the NASA ARCTAS field campaign period in June 2008. STEM simulations use time-varying boundary conditions downscaled from global GEOS-Chem model simulations. Standard GEOS-Chem simulation overall underpredicted ozone at 1-5 km in the eastern Pacific, resulting in underestimated contributions from the transported background pollutants to surface ozone inland. These negative biases can be reduced by using the output from several global models that support the HTAP2 experiment, which all ran with the HTAP2 harmonized emission inventory and also calculated the contributions from east Asian anthropogenic emissions. We demonstrate that the biases in GEOS-Chem boundary conditions can be more efficiently reduced via assimilating satellite ozone profiles from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument using the three dimensional variational (3D-Var) approach. Base upon these TES-constrained GEOS-Chem boundary conditions, we then update regional nitrogen dioxide and isoprene emissions in STEM through the four dimensional variational (4D-Var) assimilation of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide columns and the NASA DC-8 aircraft isoprene measurements. The 4D-Var assimilation spatially redistributed the emissions of nitrogen oxides and isoprene from various US sources, and in the meantime updated the modeled ozone and its US source contributions. Compared with available independent measurements (e.g., ozone observed on the DC-8 aircraft, and at EPA and Mt. Bachelor monitoring stations) during this period, modeled ozone fields after the multi-scale assimilation show overall improvement.",

            "abstract": "Germanium (Ge) is an element with a chemical behavior very similar to that of silicon (Si), albeit with some important differences. As a result, Ge/Si ratios in the environment can be used to investigate the Si cycle. For example, glacial-interglacial variations of the global marine Ge/Si ratio1 could be reflecting either changes in terrestrial weathering (river water Ge/Si has been proposed as a proxy for silicate weathering intensity1) or the degree of decoupling between Ge and Si during marine sediment diagenesis and burial2.\nThe investigation of Ge stable isotopes (δ74Ge) may help to better constrain the dynamics of the Ge cycle and aid in the interpretation of Ge/Si paleorecords. It also has the potential to provide useful information on the weathering environment, complementing other isotopic critical zone proxies, such as δ7Li, δ30Si, 87Sr/86Sr, etc..\nWe present the first δ74Ge measurements of river waters. We analyzed δ74Ge as well as Ge/Si ratios and several other major and trace element concentrations across a mountain-to-floodplain gradient reaching from the Peruvian Andes to the Amazon. In contrast with other areas and the global trend1, there is no correlation between Ge/Si and Si concentration among different tributaries, indicating either the heterogeneity of Ge sources or the dominance of different secondary weathering reactions within different tributary catchments. We are currently investigating if Ge/Si varies with seasonal changes in runoff, which may help constrain the factors controlling Ge/Si.\nRiver water δ74Ge ranges from +3.4 to +6.5‰ among the different tributaries and is heavy relative to Bulk Silicate Earth (δ74Ge = +0.6‰3). Significant negative correlation of δ74Ge and Ge/Si suggests that both ratios may be fractionated during Ge uptake with secondary mineral precipitation. Similar (but weaker) correlation is observed for an extended dataset, including multiple U.S. rivers draining various lithologies.\nOverall, our data show that δ74Ge and Ge/Si have the potential to provide useful information on continental weathering processes and further investigation of these proxies in the critical zone is warranted.\nFroelich et al.

            "abstract": "Metadata standards provide common definitions of metadata fields for information exchange across user communities. Despite the broad adoption of metadata standards for Earth science data, there are still heterogeneous and incompatible representations of information due to differences between the many standards in use and how each standard is applied. Federal agencies are required to manage and publish metadata in different metadata standards and formats for various data catalogs. In 2014, the NOAA National Climatic data Center (NCDC) managed metadata for its scientific datasets in ISO 19115-2 in XML, GCMD Directory Interchange Format (DIF) in XML, DataCite Schema in XML, Dublin Core in XML, and Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) in JSON, with more standards and profiles of standards planned. Of these standards, the ISO 19115-series metadata is the most complete and feature-rich, and for this reason it is used by NCDC as the source for the other metadata standards. We will discuss the capabilities of metadata standards and how these standards are being implemented to document datasets. Successful implementations include developing translations and displays using XSLTs, creating links to related data and resources, documenting dataset lineage, and establishing best practices. Benefits, gaps, and challenges will be highlighted with suggestions for improved approaches to metadata storage and maintenance.",

            "abstract": "To establish effective emission controls to achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), state air agencies need to quantify contributions to extreme ozone events from anthropogenic precursor emissions sources from a given state versus from regional and international pollution transport or from natural sources. An understanding of the meteorology and sources contributing to observed high ozone events is a first step towards assessing the impacts on surface ozone from future changes in regional climate. We analyze two Eastern U.S. (EUS) high ozone events that led to exceedances of the ozone NAAQS in multiple states: (1) June 10-18, 2007 and (2) June 24-July 14, 2012. These events are prototypes for determining source contributions and establishing a baseline for comparison with other EUS ozone pollution episodes. We (1) use daily NOAA weather maps, observed surface ozone concentrations, and satellite NO2 columns to identify regional transport and (2) analyze a series of emission perturbation simulations with the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model (2ºx 2.5º) to estimate contributions from several sources. We find that enhancements of the NO2 column persist for days over multiple states and are examining whether the persistence of this typically short-lived ozone precursor is due to regional transport and its contribution to the pollution event. As in other historical EUS extreme ozone events, high pressure systems facilitate regional ozone build-up during June 10-18, 2007. For example, observed surface ozone over WI is 60-85 ppb. GEOS-Chem captures the main features of the observed ozone enhancements and attributes less than 15% (~4-10 ppb) to WI anthropogenic emissions; over 50% (~32-50 ppb) to other U.S. states’ anthropogenic emissions; and greater than 10% (~10-20 ppb) to Canadian anthropogenic emissions. Similar to the 2007 event, high pressure systems dominate the EUS during the 2012 episode and the model indicates that anthropogenic U.S. sources contribute the most to the high ozone observed on these days. During the first two weeks of July, however, the region is influenced by stationary fronts. We will discuss how the changing meteorological situation influences the relative source contributions to regional ozone accumulation.",

            "abstract": "Glacial-interglacial cycles are responsible for the largest natural perturbations in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over the past million years. Ice cores from Antarctica document a two-part rise in atmospheric CO2 by nearly 80 ppm during the last glacial termination in phase with southern hemisphere warm events. Although the source and cause of the rise in atmospheric CO2 remains a mystery, the rapid decrease in the 13C and radiocarbon signature of atmospheric carbon in sync with southern hemisphere warming provides key constraints [Monnin et al., 2001; Lourantau et al., 2010]. These data have led to the hypothesis that carbon accumulated in the abyssal Southern Ocean during glacial periods. Extensive sea ice and/or northward shifted westerly winds reduced upwelling and mixing of the carbon-rich deep waters to the surface ocean under glacial conditions, effectively isolating large volumes of carbon from the atmosphere. If correct, during glacial terminations we expect to find evidence for pulses of old carbon to the Southern Ocean surface and intermediate waters (SOIW) as the climate warmed.\nRadiocarbon measurements on benthic foraminifera provide direct evidence for the presence or absence of old carbon in intermediate and deep water masses. We add to a growing dataset of benthic foraminiferal radiocarbon data from sites bathed by SOIWs during the last glacial termination by evaluating the radiocarbon age of coeval benthic and planktic foraminifera in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP). We find definitive evidence for a sustained input of old carbon to SOIWs during the Younger Dryas and pulses of old carbon during Heinrich Stadial 1. The magnitude and timing of the benthic radiocarbon excursions in our record are comparable to those measured previously at intermediate depths near Baja [Marchitto et al., 2007] but are significantly less depleted than measurements made at a neighboring site in the Galapagos Islands: we record a minimum Δ14C of -310‰ versus the nearly -600‰ measured by Stott et al. [2009]. Our record is strikingly similar in structure to a benthic 14C record from the Southeast Pacific [Bryan, 2010], just below the site of SOIW formation, which thus provides support for a Southern Ocean source of old carbon to the EEP and atmosphere during the last glacial termination.",

            "abstract": "The seismicity of Bhutan is characterized by the apparent lack of great earthquakes and a significantly lower activity compared to most other parts of the Himalayan arc. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of this anomalously low activity and to relate it with possible along-strike differences in the structure of the orogenic belt, a temporary network with 38 broadband seismometers was installed in the Kingdom of Bhutan between January 2013 and April 2014.\nIn this work we present a first catalog of local and regional earthquakes detected and located with the GANSSER (Geodynamics ANd Seismic Structure of the Eastern-Himalaya Region) network. Events were automatically detected using STA/LTA triggers with a global 1-D velocity model. A subset of more than 800 automatic locations were manually reviewed and more than 400 events in Bhutan and surrounding regions have been manually repicked and accurately relocated. Magnitudes of these hypocenters range from ML 0.5 to 5.6. Seismicity along the Main Frontal and Main Boundary Thrusts in south-central Bhutan is very low. The highest activity is clustered along a NE-SW oriented structure in southwest Bhutan, which might be associated with the Goalpara lineament. In eastern Bhutan a cluster of seismicity is identified in the vicinity of the 2009 Mw=6.2 event and the embayment of the Main Central Thrust, near the town of Mongar.\nFor two events in Bhutan a moment tensor was derived. Both solutions indicate strike-slip mechanisms and an Mw of 3.9 and 4.0. The majority of well-constrained focal depths ranges between 10 to 30 km and might be associated with the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). One exception is the Mw=4.0 event in northern Bhutan in June 2013, which occurred at about 70 km depth, most likely in the underthrusting Indian lower crust.\nTo further improve the accuracy of locations, about 100 events were used to simultaneously invert for seismic velocities and hypocenters. We will discuss possible seismotectonic models for Bhutan based on the relocated seismicity, focal mechanisms, seismic velocities, and interfaces (Moho and intra-crustal structures like the MHT) imaged by receiver functions.",

In this work, we explore the distribution of activation energies upon implantation and the associated hydrogen-retention times; this for comparison with recent observation of OH on the lunar surface. We apply a Monte Carlo approach: for simulated solar wind protons at a given local time, we assume a distribution of U values with a central peak, Uc and width, Uw, and derive the fraction retained for long periods in the near-surface. We find that surfaces characterized by a distribution with predominantly large values of U (> 1 eV) like that expected at defect sites will retain implanted Hs (to likely form OH). Surfaces with the distribution predominantly at small values of U (< 0.2 eV) will quickly diffuse away implanted Hs. However, surfaces with a large portion of implantation activation energies between 0.3 eV < U < 0.9 eV will tend to be H-retentive in cool conditions but transform into H-emissive surfaces when warmed (as when the surface rotates into local noon). These mid-range activation energies give rise to a diurnal effect with diffusive loss of H at noontime.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus is a geologically important element making up approximately 0.12 % of the Earth’s crust. It is commonly found as relatively insoluble apatite and this causes phosphorus to be a limiting nutrient in biologic processes. Despite this, phosphorus is a key element in DNA, RNA and other cellular materials. Recent works suggest that reduced phosphorus played a substantial role in the development of life on the early Earth. Reduced phosphorus is considerably more soluble than oxidized phosphorus, and reduced phosphorus may continue to play a role in biologic productivity. This study examines a new methodology for quantification of reduced phosphorus separated by coupled HPLC – ICP-MS. We show that phosphorus species (P1+, P3+ and P5+) are cleanly separated in the HPLC and coupled with the ICP-MS reaction cell (using O2 gas) effectively convert elemental P to P-O producing lower background and flatter baseline chromatography. Results suggest very low detection limits (0.05 mM) for P species analyzed as P-O at M/Z = 47. Additionally this technique has potential to speciate at least 5 other metastable forms of phosphorus. We verified this method on numerous materials including leached Archean rocks to suburban retention pond waters and many samples show small but detectible levels of reduced phosphorus. These data highlight a significant role of redox processing of phosphorus throughout the history of the Earth, with the reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds, phosphite and hypophosphite, potentially acting as significant constituents in the anaerobic environment.",

            "abstract": "During glacial marine transgressions, sediment & carbon are deposited due to the infilling of lowland fluvial systems, material that is then largely removed during ensuing regressions. Measuring & modelling these processes would help quantify the amount, timing, & preservation of these materials, providing insight into the morphodynamics of lowland fluvial systems in response to sea level change.\nWe investigated the infilling dynamics of the Fly and Strickland Rivers, Papua New Guinea. Field data include: 14C dated deep cores recording base level evolution over the Holocene, sonar imaging of floodbasin stratigraphy, and the observations of blocked valley lakes and weathered erosional remnants from LGM conditions. Similar research was conducted on the Mekong River, Cambodia, where we have imaged basin fill stratigraphy and recorded the extent of blocked valley lakes. Such field data provide tantalizing empirical glimpses into the landscapes & flux buffering exhibited by large tropical rivers during glacial-interglacial transitions.\n  We upscale our observations by modelling river system evolution, employing a GpU Lowland Landscape Evolution Model (GULLEM) to predict the evolution of the entire basin. A novel & powerful (>10 Tflops on an inexpensive computer) simulator, GULLEM models morphodynamics and estimates the accommodation space subsequently infilled during marine transgressions by representing a range of geomorphic processes, including: river & tributary incision, non-linear diffusion, sea level and isostatic change, hydraulic geometry, tectonic deformation, sediment production, transport & deposition, & tracking of the resulting stratigraphy. GULLEM's vectorized approach allows for massively parallel operation on GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit), making it practical to model coupled fluvial-landscape evolution for complex lowland river systems over large temporal and spatial scales.\n  Our combined approach affords estimates for the timing and budgets of sediment and carbon storage in Fly and Mekong River floodplains in response to sea level rise. This presentation will provide insights (& animations) illustrating river morphodynamics & resulting landscapes formed during the transgressions from glacial maximums to high-stand conditions.

Compared to previous results, the model errors have been strongly reduced thanks to, among other things, the introduction of currents, coastal reflection,\nand bottom sediment types. This last item allowed unprecedented accuracy at some sites along the French Atlantic coast. The adequate resolution, necessary to represent strong gradients in tidal currents,\nwas made possible by the efficiency brought by unstructured grids. A further increase in resolution, necessary to resolve surf zones and still cover vast regions is now made possible by the use of implicit schemes. First results with that scheme are presented here and should be made available in a future version 5.xx of WAVEWATCH III.",

            "abstract": "Water quality studies that quantify sediment and fecal bacteria loading commonly focus on suspended contaminants transported during high flows. Fecal contaminants in bed sediments are typically ignored and need to be considered because of their potential to increase pathogen loadings during high flows that produce bed load transport. Water (containing suspended sediment) and bed load samples (n = 145 & n = 28, respectively) were collected in a 122 km2 watershed located in N.E. Georgia, USA during the 2013 water year. Continuous discharge was calculated from level data using USGS rating curves. This study quantifies total sediment and fecal indicator bacteria loads (FIB) in an alluvial stream in a mixed land use watershed and provides valuable data for parameterization of watershed models that simulate sediment and bacteria transport. Annual loads for sediment and FIB were determined using linear relationships between the following: turbidity and total suspended solids (R2 = 0.96); turbidity and suspended Escherichia coli and enterococci (R2 = 0.54 and 0.67, respectively); discharge and bed load (R2 = 0.60), and discharge and sediment associated E. coli and enterococci (R2 = 0.55 and 0.50, respectively). The annual sediment load was 3660 t with approximately 95% attributed to suspended sediment load and 5% attributed to bed load. The annual E. coli load was 3.7 x 1014 colonies with approximately 99.5% attributed to suspended transport and 0.50% attributed to bed load sediment-associated transport. The annual enterococci load was 1.1 x 1015 colonies with approximately 100% attributed to suspended transport. Bed load sediment transport ranged from 2% to 8% of the total storm sediment load in several high flow events (Q = 5 to 40 m3 s-1). Bed sediment-associated E. coli load was 0.4% to 0.5% of the total storm E. coli load. Suspended transport is the predominant mechanism describing contaminant loading in this stream and load estimates can be determined using simple relationships between discharge and suspended concentrations.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Tuz basin is the largest intracontinental basin in Turkey and has hydrocarbon and industrial mineral reserves. Thus, there are several studies particularly intended for the pre-Neogene geology of the basin. However, there is not any detailed study related to the geological units of Neogene and Quaternary periods. This study aims to exhibit facies features of these units within spatial and temporal distributions according to field studies. In the other hand, the region has modelled through stratigraphically by computing more than 250 borehole data within 3D GeoScientific Information System. In light of obtained model, basement topographies of Neogene and Quaternary units has revealed. The model indicate high amounts of sedimentation during the Mio-Pliocene with a southward increasing thickness of a freshwater lake basin while it is a shallow saline lake basin today that regressed towards the north during the Plio-Quaternary. The combination of these results with regional geological and geophysical data (i.e. gravity and crustal thickness) allows geodynamic implications for central Turkey. The spatio-temporal variations of Late Cenozoic units reflect the main effect of endogenic forces that were caused due to lithospheric slab break-off and following asthenospheric upwelling under central Turkey.",

            "abstract": "As vehicle-based atmospheric surveying becomes more commonplace, its natural evolution will see an increased movement towards detection of multiple gases and geochemical approaches for discriminating leaks of different origin. While multi-gas surveys are already feasible, the factor limiting our ability to interpret them is the understanding of gas source-sink dynamics, particularly at the soil level. This study aims to understand the relationship between soil processes and atmospheric methane concentrations. Using source regions of approximately 100 km2, extensive soil gas surveys were completed, measuring CH4, δ13CH4 and CO2. We compared this to daytime and nighttime vehicle-based surveys where we acquired data for the same gases to see which of these individual gases, or ratios thereof, could be detected in the lower atmosphere. These surveys were done in two contrasting regions, which were also expected to have different source/sink processes. Results showed that atmospheric CH4 concentration, its isotopic signature, and the CO2/CH4 ratio of above-background concentrations showed the highest level of correspondence with the soil CH4 values. Anomalies in CH4 concentrations in the first study area appeared to be from predominantly biological sources (δ13CH4 values near −60‰) rather than from a fossil source (underlying coal beds). However, the study area also showed anomalous values of δ13CH4, which may have been due to a soil CH4 sink. In both regions, nighttime atmospheric studies generally yield stronger signals and correlations because decreased night winds contributed to pooling of gases and higher atmospheric concentrations. This study helps advance our understanding of the relationship between soil processes and atmospheric methane, which is essential for improving vehicle-based surveys for use in detecting environmental side-effects of energy and geosequestration projects in regions of complex surface gas dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Landslide failures on the scale of mountains are spectacular, dangerous, and spontaneous, making direct observations hard to obtain. Measurement of their dynamic properties during runout is a high research priority, but a logistical and technical challenge. Seismology has begun to help in several important ways. Taking advantage of broadband seismic stations, recent advances now allow: (i) the seismic detection and location of large landslides in near-real-time, even for events in very remote areas that may have remain undetected, such as the 2014 Mt La Perouse supraglacial failure in Alaska; (ii) inversion of long-period waves generated by large landslides to yield an estimate of the forces imparted by the bulk accelerating mass; (iii) inference of the landslide mass, its center-of-mass velocity over time, and its trajectory.\nKey questions persist, such as: What can the short-period seismic data tell us about the high-frequency impacts taking place within the granular flow and along its boundaries with the underlying bedrock? And how does this seismicity relate to the bulk acceleration of the landslide and the long-period seismicity generated by it?\nOur recent work on the joint analysis of short- and long-period seismic signals generated by past and recent events, such as the Bingham Canyon Mine and the Oso-Steelhead landslides, provides new insights to tackle these issues. Qualitative comparison between short-period signal features and kinematic parameters inferred from long-period surface wave inversion helps to refine interpretation of the source dynamics and to understand the different mechanisms for the origin of the short-period wave radiation. Our new results also suggest that quantitative relationships can be derived from this joint analysis, in particular between the short-period seismic signal envelope and the inferred momentum of the center-of-mass. In the future, these quantitative relationships may help to constrain and calibrate parameters used in inversion or simulation of long-period waves generated by landslides. Relating the center-of-mass dynamics to the short-period seismic signal might also yield a new means to estimate kinematic parameters for the smaller events that generate too weak long-period seismic waves to allow inversion or simulation of the seismic source.",

            "abstract": "Investigating climate dynamics governing rainfall over the western US during past warmings and coolings of the last glacial and deglaciation is pertinent to understanding how precipitation patterns might change with future global warming, especially as the processes driving the global hydrological reorganization affecting this drought-prone region during these rapid temperature changes remain unresolved. We present model climates of the Bølling warm event (14,500 years ago) and Younger Dryas cool event (12,200 years ago) that i) uniquely enable the assessment of dueling hypothesis about the atmospheric teleconnections responsible for abrupt temperature shifts in the North Atlantic region to variations in moisture conditions across the western US, and ii) show that existing hypotheses about these teleconnections are unsupported. Modeling results show no evidence for a north-south shift of the Pacific winter storm track, and we argue that a tropical moisture source with evolving trajectory cannot explain alternation between wet/dry conditions, which have been reconstructed from the proxy record. Alternatively, model results support a new hypothesis that variations in the intensity of the winter storm track, corresponding to its expansion/contraction, can account for regional moisture differences between warm and cool intervals of the last deglaciation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mechanism forcing the teleconnection between the North Atlantic and western US is the same across different boundary conditions. In our simulation, during the last deglaciation, and in simulations of future warming, perturbation of the Rossby wave structure reconfigures the atmospheric state. This reconfiguration affects the Aleutian Low and high-pressure ridge over and off of the northern North American coastline driving variability in the storm track. Similarity between the processes governing the climate response during these distinct time intervals illustrates the robust nature of the teleconnection, a novel result that provides context for understanding the climate processes governing the response of moisture variability to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "It is widely reported that land surface models (LSMs) are unable to use all of the information available from boundary conditions [1-4]. Evidence for this is that statistical models typically out-perform physics LSMs with the same forcing data. We demonstrate that this conclusion is not necessarily correct. The statistical models don’t consider parameters, and the experiments cannot distinguish between information loss and bad information (disinformation).\nRecent work has outlined a rigorous interpretation of model benchmarking that allows us to measure the amount of information provided by model physics and the amount of information lost due to model error [5]. Recognizing that a complete understanding of model adequacy requires treatment across multiple locations [6] allows us to expand benchmarking theory to segregate bad and missing information. The result is a benchmarking method that that can distinguish error due to parameters, forcing data, and model structure - and, unlike other approaches, does not rely on parameter estimation, which can only provide estimates of parameter uncertainty conditional on model physics.\nOur new benchmarking methodology was compared with the standard methodology to measure information loss in several LSMs included in the current and developmental generations of the North American Land Data Assimilation System. The classical experiments implied that each of these models lose a significant amount of information from the forcing data; however, the new methodology shows clearly that this information did not actually exist in the boundary conditions in the first place. Almost all model bias can be attributed to incorrect parameters, and that most of the LSMs actually add information (via model physics) to what is available in the boundary conditions.\n1 Abramowitz, G., Geophys Res Let 32, (2005).\n2 Gupta, H.

            "abstract": "The Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) is an aircraft-based Earth Venture 1 mission to study the carbon balance of the Alaskan Arctic ecosystem, with a particular focus on carbon release from melting permafrost. Operating from its base in Fairbanks, AK, the CARVE aircraft covers a range of principle flight paths in the Alaskan interior, the Yukon River valley, and the northern Alaska coast around Barrow and Dead Horse. Flight paths are chosen to maximize ecosystem variability and cover burn-recovery/regrowth sequences. CARVE observations cover the Arctic Spring/Summer/Fall seasons, with multiple flights per season and principle flight path. Science operations started in 05/2012 and are currently envisaged to continue until 2015.\nThe CARVE suite of instruments includes flask measurements, in situ gas analyzers for CO2, CH4 and CO observations, and a three-band polarizing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for column measurements of CO2, CH4, CO, their interfering species (e.g., H2O), and O2. The FTS covers the spectral regions of 4,200-4,900 cm-1 (CH4, CO), 5,800-6,400 cm-1 (CO2), and 12,900-13,200 cm-1 (O2), with a spectral resolution of 0.2 cm-1. Aircraft-based FTS science observations in Alaska have been performed since 23-05-2012. First-version data products from all CARVE instruments derived from observations during the 2012 campaign were publicly released earlier in 2013.\nThe FTS has performed well during flight conditions, particularly with respect to vibration damping. We present results from FTS column observations of CO2, CH4, and CO, observed during the 2012, 2013, and 2014 campaigns, including comparisons of CARVE FTS measurements with satellite observations of CO2 from TANSO/GOSAT retrieved by JPL/ACOS, and MOPITT CO.",

It is bounded to the south by the NE-SW striking Yavapai province, which was accreted along the southeastern margin of North America between 1.71 and 1.68 Ga and was one of a series of major collisional events responsible for the assembly of Laurentia. In this study, PdS teleseismic receiver functions were used to investigate the deep crustal structure associated with these collisions. Using data from over 800 broadband seismic stations distributed throughout the Great Plains/Midcontinent region, we calculated .5 Hz receiver functions using 245 M > 6.0 teleseismic events. The receiver functions were then CCP (common conversion point) stacked to create a 3D image volume. Profiles through this image volume show evidence of crustal scale thrusting of the Wyoming province in the west over the Superior province in the east and structural underplating associated with the Yavapai-Superior boundary. We also performed a density analysis of the region using the 2p1s and 0p1s receiver function phases from 233 stations. These data indicate a relatively low Moho density contrast throughout the THO and northern Yavapai region associated with a region of thickened crust (> 50 km), which we interpret to be evidence of a dense lower crustal layer that may be the result mafic underplating. Additionally, we investigate the role that this dense layer may have on the stabilization of the Superior craton and others relative to compositionally and thermally derived density variations in the mantle lithosphere.",

While global models require a global input grid, direct porosity measurements are sparse. We compare gridding techniques from previous modelers (nearest neighbor interpolation, kriging, etc.) to both physical and statistical prediction techniques including Bayesian networks and random decision forests (RDF). Sparse data (only a few thousand direct seafloor porosity measurements worldwide) and sampling bias (toward shallow water depths and low-middle latitudes) adversely affect the interpolated grids. Estimating porosity as a function of water depth alone is as effective in some regions. We have roughly doubled the number of available data points by calculating porosity from thermal conductivity measurements, but sampling bias and spatial data gaps remain problematic. In contrast, statistical methods such as RDF allow for more geologically intelligent predictions, decreasing the effect of sampling bias and improving predictions in regions with little or no data, while rigorously estimating the uncertainty of the result. Statistical prediction is based on empirical statistical relationships between porosity and other parameters for which we have compiled or generated more densely sampled estimates (e.g. water depth, sediment grain type, proximity to rivers or volcanoes). Our results demonstrate the utility of RDF in predicting properties for use in earth system models.",

            "abstract": "Aurora occurs in different well-known morphologies, or types, including the best-known arcs and patchy-pulsating aurora (PPA). Previous observational studies have demonstrated that the ionospheric effects of auroral precipitation affect the accuracy of global navigation satellite systems, but how different types of aurora might affect GNSS differently has not been investigated to date. In an initial attempt to explore the relationship between auroral type and the resulting effects on GNSS, we have used data from a THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) All-Sky Imager (ASI) located at Sanikiluaq (~67º geo.mag. lat.), Canada. GPS data was also obtained from a Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) GPS receiver collocated with the THEMIS ASI. This GPS receiver is a commercial GPS scintillation receiver. A list of 140 patchy aurora events and 180 auroral arc events were catalogued from the ASI data for the years 2008-2013. Corresponding scintillation data for these time periods were obtained from the GPS receiver. In order to determine the effects of PPA and arcs on GPS signals, the number of cycle slips observed during each event were calculated. A total number of 197 cycle slips were observed during PPA compared to 16 cycle slips observed during arcs. This result suggests PPA affects GPS in a more adverse manner than auroral arcs. Even though the magnitude of the phase scintillation index (σφ) observed for auroral arcs was much higher than for PPA, the receiver was able to keep lock on to the signals much better during arcs compared to patchy aurora. We have also calculated spectral slopes/spectral index for all events which had σφ > 0.3. We obtained around 1500 spectral slopes for events during auroral arcs and around 600 for events during patchy aurora. Although the histograms for these spectral indices seem to reveal that average spectral index for both of these phenomena was ~3.5, spectral indices for auroral arcs seem to tend towards higher values compared to spectral indices of PPA. This result seems to suggest that for auroral arcs, large sized ionospheric irregularities dominate their spectral content compared to PPA. Elevation-angle and azimuthal distributions of PPA and arcs were also considered in this study.",

While co-seismic and post-seismic responses to the three major earthquakes have been extrapolated from temporally correlated well data, here we develop a numerical model to reconstruct the aquifers’ response to each earthquake. By using fault slip distributions modeled from InSAR data, we can project the effects of slip on the fault to monitored well sites around the Canterbury region, ultimately extrapolating the stress regimes at these adjacent localities. Furthermore, our model will enable us to extract the specific responses of the hydrologic systems to both the co-seismic and post-seismic effects of the earthquakes. With this model we hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of aquifer behavior, localized liquefaction, and surface deformation in relation to this devastating series of earthquakes.",

We focus on: Maumee River Basin, a major source of agricultural P to Lake Erie, the southernmost and shallowest of the Laurentian Great Lakes; Thames River Basin, where fluxes of effluent P from the London, England metropolitan area have declined following improvements in wastewater treatment; Yangtze (Changjiang) River Basin, the largest in China, which is undergoing rapid economic development. The Maumee and Thames are intensively monitored, and show long-term declines in basin P inputs that represent a step towards P sustainability. However, river P outputs have been slower to decline, consistent with the hypothesis that legacy P is mobilizing from soils or from within the river network. Published data on the Yangtze indicate the P flux from land to water has clearly increased with industrialization and population growth. Historical trajectories of P accumulation and depletion in major river basins are providing new understanding about the long-term impacts of P management, including watershed P legacies and response times, that may inform future policy towards local, national, and global P sustainability.",

By now we have studied the extreme solar storms in May 1921, October-November 2003 and July 2012. A solid torus model was developed to explain the extreme solar storms of May 1921. The most recent extreme solar storm in July 2012 makes it possible to use magnetic field data of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and derived magnetic field complexity parameters of the SHARP system. Preliminary daily probabilistic warnings of severe solar flares, based on SDO magnetic field complexity and SHARP parameters will be presented. The general goal is to try to integrate the topological with the probabilistic approach into a daily warning system of severe to extreme solar storms.",

            "abstract": "The seismic waves propagating in mountainous areas are highly disrupted by the intricate surface geometry. As a consequence of that effect, the topography produces large ground-motion amplifications in the vicinity of summits, possibly causing damages during large earthquakes. Another consequence is the strong variability of the ground motion occurring on steep slopes, where the amplification patterns are complex and event-dependent. We introduce a new methodology to forecast the topographic site-effect amplification. Ground motions are obtained from a large database of 3-D earthquake simulations with numerical accuracy achieved up to 4 Hz and including the topography surrounding the inter-Disciplinary Underground Science and Technology laboratory (i-DUST/LSBB), Rustrel, France. Those ground motions show that the Earth’s surface curvature, defined as the second spatial-derivative of the elevation map, is correlated with the topographic site amplification. The highest linear correlation between the frequency-dependent topographic amplification and the topographic curvature is reached when the curvature is smoothed over a characteristic length equal to the S-wavelength divided by two, implying that the amplification is caused by topographic features whose horizontal dimensions are similar to half of the S-wavelength. The largest single-station variabilities are found at sites located on slopes and on the largest summits, while intermediate variabilities occur over narrow ridges and a stable behavior in the bottom valleys. The Frequency-Scaled Curvature (FSC) proxy allows the determination of topographic features with similar characteristic dimensions and probabilistic estimates of amplification values accounting on the phenomenon variability. Amplification estimates using the FSC proxy are robust and easily computed from digital elevation maps provided reasonable values of S-velocities in the area of interest.",

            "abstract": "California is experiencing one of its worst droughts in history; in early 2014, the Governor released the Water Action Plan outlining opportunities to secure reliable water supplies. Groundwater recharge and storage is suggested as an alternative to surface storage, but little research has been conducted to see if groundwater recharge is a competitive alternative to other water-supply infrastructure projects. Although groundwater recharge and storage data are not readily available, several voter-approved bonds have helped finance groundwater recharge and storage projects and can be used as a proxy for costs, geographic distribution, and interest in such projects. We mined and analyzed available grant applications submitted to the Department of Water Resources that include groundwater recharge and storage elements. We found that artificial recharge can be cheaper than other water-supply infrastructure, but the cost was dependent on the source of water, the availability and accessibility of infrastructure used to capture and convey water, and the method of recharge. Bond applications and funding awards were concentrated in the Central Valley and southern California – both are regions of high water demand. With less than 60% of proposals funded, there are opportunities for groundwater recharge and storage to play a bigger role in securing California’s water supplies.",

            "abstract": "The Western Solomons forearc has undergone repeated uplifts that probably were coseismic and similar to that during the 1 April 2007 Mw 8.1 megathrust rupture that raised the outer forearc as much as 2.5 m. A parallel swath of the inner forearc subsided ~0.5 m during the 2007 event. The Western Solomons is ideal for crustal motion measurements because both the outer forearc above the seismogenic zone and the inner forearc are occupied by reef-fringed islands enabling land-based measurements of vertical displacements. U-series and 14C dating of uplifted corals and microatolls has provided the ages for a number of paleo-uplift events that we infer to have been coseismic. While the outer forearc has uplifted rapidly in late Holocene time at rates from ~1 to 8 mm/yr, the inner forearc has risen at only 0 – 1.1 mm/yr. It is notable that the inner and outer forearcs are separated by an arc-parallel boundary along which there is little or no net uplift. However, although both the inner and outer forearcs have late Quaternary histories of relatively rapid net uplift, they appear to have quite different uplift histories. The outer forearc has uplifted several times over the past 1000 years by as much as several meters in each event. Although the inner forearc subsided during the 2007 event and should subside during all events that ruptured the seismogenic zone beneath the outer forearc, it also has undergone abrupt late Holocene uplifts that do not correspond to those of the outer forearc. But the most surprising difference between the inner and outer forearcs is that 8-9 ka corals in growth position and emerged solution notches were found in a number of inner forearc sites adjacent to corals of the ~6 ka mid-Holocene high sea level that was a little higher than present sea level. Because sea level at 8-9 ka was 10-20 m lower than present in this region, 10-20 m of uplift is required between 8-9 ka and 6 ka during one or more tectonic events. Some of the 9 ka corals have morphologies indicate abrupt emergence that may have been coseismic. Much slower uplift after ~8 ka allowed rising sea level to almost overtake the 8-9 ka corals. Fortunately they remained slightly above subsequent sea level so that we could discover them. Our presentation will show the evidence and propose hypotheses to explain the early Holocene interval of great uplift inferred from the 8-9 ka corals.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation, we outline the USGS response to dramatically increased earthquake activity in the central and eastern US, with a focus on Oklahoma. Using the November 2011 Prague, OK earthquake sequence as an example, we describe the tensions between the need to conduct thorough scientific investigations while providing timely information to local, state, and federal government agencies, and the public. In the early morning hours of November 5, 2011 a M4.8 earthquake struck near the town of Prague, Oklahoma and was followed by a M5.6 earthquake just over 20 hours later. The mainshock was widely felt across the central US, causing damage to homes close to the epicenter and injuring at least 2 people. Within hours of the initial event several portable instruments were installed and following the mainshock a larger seismic deployment was mounted (Keranen et al., 2013). A sizeable earthquake in the central or eastern US is always of scientific interest due to the dearth of seismic data available for assessing seismic hazard. The Prague sequence garnered especially strong scientific and public interest when a link between the sequence and injection of wastewater at several local deep wells was postulated. Therefore, there was a need to provide immediate information as it became available. However, in the first few days to months it was impossible to confidently confirm or refute whether the seismicity was linked to injection, but it was known that the foreshock occurred close to several deep injection wells and many of the events were shallow; thus, the sequence warranted further study. Over the course of the next few years, several studies built the case that the Prague sequence was likely induced by wastewater injection (Keranen et al., 2013; Sumy et al., 2014; McGarr, 2014) and additional studies suggested that the changes in seismicity throughout Oklahoma were not due to natural variations in seismicity rates (Llenos and Michael, 2013; Ellsworth, 2013). These studies changed the public discourse from providing primary information about the on-going earthquake sequences to how to mitigate the hazard associated with wastewater injection. And, scientific studies are now focused on how to include the impact of induced events within the National Seismic Hazard Maps (e.g. Peterson et al., 2014).",

            "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and other transient solar phenomena play important roles in magnetospheric and exospheric dynamics. Although a planet may only occasionally interact with the products of these events, such transient phenomena can result in departures from the background solar wind that often involve more than an order of magnitude greater ram pressure and interplanetary electric field applied to the magnetosphere. For Mercury, an order of magnitude greater ram pressure can push the magnetopause to the planet’s surface, exposing the surface directly to the solar wind. In order to understand how the solar wind interacts with Mercury’s magnetosphere and exosphere, previous studies have used the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-ENLIL solar wind modeling tool to calculate basic and composite solar wind parameters, such as solar wind velocity (V) and Alfvén Mach number (MA) at Mercury’s orbital location. This model forecasts only the background solar wind, however, and does not include these transient events. The Cone extension permits the inclusion of CMEs and other phenomena, and thus enables characterization of the effect of strong solar wind perturbations on the Mercury system. The Cone extension is predicated on the assumption of constant angular and radial velocities of ejecta to integrate them into the WSA-ENLIL coupled model. Comparisons of the model results with the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft observations indicate that the WSA-ENLIL-Cone model more accurately forecasts total solar wind conditions at Mercury and has greater predictive power for magnetospheric and exospheric processes than the WSA-ENLIL model alone.",

            "abstract": "A common feature of continental collision zones is the entrainment of ophiolitic and subduction complex rock units. The crystallization and metamorphic ages of these units provide important constraints on both subduction zone evolution and the maximum age of ophiolite obduction. Ophiolites and subduction complexes have been well described in the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone (YTSZ), but thus far relatively few high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic assemblages from within the suture zone have been documented and successfully dated. Here we present structural, petrologic, and chronologic data from a recently discovered subduction complex occurrence of high-pressure (blueschist facies) rocks along the YTSZ in south central Tibet (29.31º N, 86.68º E). Mapping of the complex based on ASTER satellite image analysis as well as field work enabled the identification of four major lithostratigaphic units; from structurally highest to lowest, they are: 1) forarc affinity Chengdoi sandstones 2) a variably serpentinized ophiolitic fragment; 3) a structural mélange of blueschist-facies metabasic and metaclastic rocks; and 4) sandstones containing serpentinite and rutile detritus. The second and third of these tectonostratigraphic units are separated by thrust faults, whereas the Chengdoi sandstones unconformably overlie the ophiolitic fragment. We interpret the thrust separating the blueschists from the ophiolites as a paleo-subduction zone that dips northward when the entire section is rotated to restore the Chengdoi formation to horizontal. The subduction complex is further disrupted by oblique faults, including some with apparent normal sense offset that may be pre-collisional, intraoceanic normal faults. U/Pb zircon dating of the blueschist facies metavlocanic rocks implies a ca. 111 Ma protolith age, while a ca. 65 Ma 40Ar/39Ar amphibole date from one blueschist sample is interpreted as representing a close approximation of the timing of high-pressure metamorphism given Zr-in-rutile constraints on maximum metamorphic temperatures of ≤ 540˚C. The metamorphic age also constrains suturing along this segment of the YTSZ to have postdated the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.",

            "abstract": "Implementation of \"The Math You Need, When You Need It\" (TMYN) modules at a wide variety of institutions suggests a broad need for faculty support in helping students develop quantitative skills necessary in introductory geoscience courses. Designed to support students in applying geoscience relevant quantitative skills, TMYN modules are web-based, self-paced and commonly assigned outside of class. They include topics such as calculating slope, rearranging equations, and unit conversions and provide several applications of the mathematical technique to geoscience problems. Each instructor chooses modules that are applicable to the content in his/her individual course and students typically work through the module immediately before the module topic is applied in lab or class. Instructors assigned TMYN modules in their courses at more than 40 diverse institutions, including four-year colleges and universities (4YCs) that vary from non-selective to highly selective and open-door two-year colleges (2YCs). Analysis of module topics assigned, frequency of module use, and institutional characteristics reveals similarities and differences among faculty perception of required quantitative skills and incoming student ability at variably selective institutions. Results indicate that institutional type and selectivity are not correlated with module topic; that is, faculty apply similar quantitative skills in all introductory geoscience courses. For example, nearly every instructor assigned the unit conversions module, whereas very few required the trigonometry module. However, differences in number of assigned modules and faculty expectations are observed between 2YCs and 4YCs (no matter the selectivity). Two-year college faculty typically assign a higher number of modules per course and faculty at 4YCs more often combine portions of multiple modules or cover multiple mathematical concepts in a single assignment. These observations suggest that quantitative skills required for introductory geoscience courses are similar among all higher-education institution types. However, faculty at 4YCs may expect students to acquire and apply multiple quantitative skills in the same class/lab, whereas 2YC faculty may structure assignments to introduce and apply only one quantitative technique at a time.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates seismicity in Greece based on the science of complex systems. The studied area is characterized mainly by active subduction and extensional tectonic features. The evolution of such tectonically active regions is expressed through seismicity and is characterized by complex phenomenology. Nonextensive statistical physics (NESP) is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical physics and has been successfully used for the analysis of a variety of complex systems, where fractality and long-range interactions are important. The frequency-magnitude distribution analysis is performed in a nonextensive statistical physics context. The nonextensive parameter qM, which is related to the frequency-magnitude distribution, reflects the existence of long-range correlations and is used as an index of the physical state of the studied area. Moreover, temperature distribution within the earth’s crust has important effects on the active tectonics and seismicity. The spatial distribution of the nonextensive thermostatistical parameter qM and the heat flow are examined regarding seismicity in Greece. Using them we try to decode the spatial characteristics of seismicity in Greece. The models used, fit rather well to the observed distributions, implying the usefulness of NESP in the investigation of seismicity and such phenomena where non linearity, long range interactions, long memory effects and scaling are important.",

            "abstract": "Southern California represents an ideal natural laboratory to investigate oblique deformation in 3D owing to its comprehensive datasets, complex tectonic history, evolving components of oblique slip, and continued crustal rotations about horizontal and vertical axes. As the SCEC Community Fault Model (CFM) aims to accurately reflect this 3D deformation, we present the results of an extensive update to the model by using primarily detailed fault trace, seismic reflection, relocated hypocenter and focal mechanism nodal plane data to generate improved, more realistic digital 3D fault surfaces. The results document a wide variety of oblique strain accommodation, including various aspects of strain partitioning and fault-related folding, sets of both high-angle and low-angle faults that mutually interact, significant non-planar, multi-stranded faults with variable dip along strike and with depth, and active mid-crustal detachments. In places, closely-spaced fault strands or fault systems can remain surprisingly subparallel to seismogenic depths, while in other areas, major strike-slip to oblique-slip faults can merge, such as the S-dipping Arroyo Parida-Mission Ridge and Santa Ynez faults with the N-dipping North Channel-Pitas Point-Red Mountain fault system, or diverge with depth. Examples of the latter include the steep-to-west-dipping Laguna Salada-Indiviso faults with the steep-to-east-dipping Sierra Cucapah faults, and the steep southern San Andreas fault with the adjacent NE-dipping Mecca Hills-Hidden Springs fault system. In addition, overprinting by steep predominantly strike-slip faulting can segment which parts of intersecting inherited low-angle faults are reactivated, or result in mutual cross-cutting relationships. The updated CFM 3D fault surfaces thus help characterize a more complex pattern of fault interactions at depth between various fault sets and linked fault systems, and a more complex fault geometry than typically inferred or expected from projecting near-surface data down-dip, or modeled from surface strain and potential field data alone.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, many anthropogenic pollutants have been successfully reduced, providing improved air quality. However, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing and natural gas operations could be counteracting some of these benefits. Using hourly measurements from Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) in the Baltimore, MD and Washington, D.C. areas, we observed that following a period of decline, daytime ethane concentrations have increased significantly since 2010. This trend appears to be linked with the rapid natural gas production in upwind, neighboring states, especially Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Furthermore, ethane concentrations failed to display this trend at a PAMS site outside of Atlanta, GA, a region without widespread natural gas operations.\nYear-to-year changes in VOCs were further evaluated by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to perform source apportionment on hourly observations in Essex, MD from 2005-2013. This process takes ambient measurements and attributes them to sources such as biogenic, natural gas, industrial, gasoline, and vehicle exhaust by using tracer species as identifiers. Preliminary PMF results also indicate an increasing influence of natural gas sources for this area.",

            "abstract": "Hodell et al. (2001) suggested that carbonate preservation in the deep Cape Basin represented a qualitative, high-resolution record of the temporal evolution of the carbonate saturation state of the deep sea. The carbonate signal reflects both transient events in the redistribution of alkalinity and DIC in the deep ocean and steady-state mass balance processes. Here we re-analyzed the carbonate records of Sites 1089/TN057-21 using an Avaatech XRF core scanner and measured elemental variations at 2.5-mm resolution for the past 400 kyrs. Log Ca/Ti is highly correlated to weight percent carbonate content and other dissolution proxies and resolves millennial-scale events in carbonate preservation. A high-pass filter removes the low-frequency (orbital) variability in carbonate preservation, which is attributed mainly to steady-state mass balance processes. The high-frequency (suborbital) component reflects transient responses to the redistribution of carbonate ion that is related mainly to changing deep-water circulation.\nDuring the last glacial period, distinct millennial-scale increases in carbonate preservation in piston core TN057-21 occurred during times of enhanced Atlantic Meridional Overtunring Circulation (AMOC) (Barker et al., 2010; Barker and Diz, 2014), as supported by increases in benthic δ13C and less radiogenic εNd values. Carbonate preservation peaked particularly during long, warm interstadials in Greenland when a deep water mass with high carbonate ion concentration was formed in the North Atlantic. Export of NADW may have been greater than the Holocene during some of these events (“overshoots”) and/or preformed carbonate ion concentrations in North Atlantic source areas may have been higher owing to lower atmospheric CO2 and less carbonate production in surface water. Each South Atlantic carbonate peak is associated with the start of Antarctic cooling and declining or leveling of atmospheric CO2, reflecting the signature of a thermal bipolar seesaw. The increased flux of carbonate ion to the Southern Ocean during strong interstadials may have played a role in titrating respiratory CO2, thereby slowing CO2 degassing to the atmosphere and providing a secondary mechanism, in addition to heat transport, for interhemispheric coupling on millennial time scales.",

Here, we present the first detailed glacial geomorphic map of Río Tranquilo valley (47° S), which provide the basis for the reconstruction of the glacial and paleoclimatic history of the region. Río Tranquilo is a valley glacier located in the northern flank of Mount San Lorenzo, an isolated granitic massif, ~95 km to the east of the southern limit of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI). Based on analysis of aerial photographs, satellite imagery and field-checking, we identified glacial landforms, including moraine, moraine ridges, outwash plain, proglacial lake and trimlines. We also included other non-glacial geomorphic features, such as deltas, rivers, lakes, alluvial fans, fluvial terraces, scarps and landslides. Preliminary 10Be ages suggest that all the glacial landforms identified here were deposited during the Late-Glacial and throughout the Holocene. Geomorphic evidence shows at least four periods of glacial stabilization. Identification of these multiples advances may hold implications for the design and interpretation of a dating programme.

            "abstract": "The lunar Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission has provided a global gravity field of unparalleled resolution. There has been a strong scientific effort to understand the Bouguer anomalies (BA) of complex lunar craters (cf., impact basins) so that they can be used as probes of both the lunar crust and the cratering process itself [Phillips et al., 2012]. One of the key challenges in understanding the signal associated with craters has been separating out the background anomaly. We use a database of >1000 craters with the gravity and topography cutoff at degree and order 600. We focus on intermediate-sized craters with a diameter range of ~30–150 km. With this database, we compare different methods of isolating the crater anomaly, including subtracting the mean BA of a background annulus and spectral high-pass filtering. Specifically we set the minimum degree of expansion, lmin, to (2πR0)/(n·D) where R0 is the lunar radius, D is the crater diameter, and n is an integer between 3 and 6. We find that by scaling the background annulus and n as shown in Table 1, the two methods are in very close agreement.\nTable 1\nBackground Annulus\nn\n1.0r ↔ 1.5r\n3\n1.5r ↔ 2.0r\n4\n2.0r ↔ 2.5r\n5\n2.5r ↔ 3.0r\n6\nMonte Carlo simulations are used to test the hypothesis that the crater Bouguer anomalies are due to the pre-existing density structure of the crust or processing artifacts. These simulations have shown that the magnitude of a Bouguer anomaly (by either method of background signal removal) scales with the diameter used and is not diagnostic of the cratering process. We infer this behavior is due to the strong redness (power increases with wavelength) of the Bouguer spectrum.\nWe have also found robust regional differences, including a high predominance of craters with associated negative Bouguer anomalies in South Pole Aitken basin.\nPhillips, R.

            "abstract": "The Canadian Prairies are home to 75% of Canada’s irrigated agriculture. This is supported by the historically reliable streamflow regime in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), which is initiated from snowmelt on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. This streamflow regime, however, is facing various changes. Most obviously, post-settlement water resource management in the prairies has intensively regulated the timing and volume of natural streamflows. Moreover, the natural streamflow regime in the SSR exhibits large inter-annual variability, influenced by the phases of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Finally, some other sources of climate variability have recently resulted in significant shifts in the timing and volume of the regional streamflow, associated with changes in the form and timing of precipitation as well as variations in annual snow accumulation and melt in headwater catchments. By considering five unregulated and three regulated streams, we formally diagnose the post-settlement drivers of variability in the SSR’s streamflow regime using various statistical tests. Our results show that long-term variations in the SSR streamflow timing and volume can be described by complex interactions among the PDO, human regulation and non-PDO sources of climate variability. For instance, human regulation can intensify the variations in annual streamflow volume during extreme PDO conditions, and non-PDO sources of climate variability can be masked by the effects of PDO and/or human regulation. Changes in the annual streamflow timing can be linked to human regulation and non-PDO sources of climate variability; in particular, human regulation is the main driver of recent dependence between annual streamflow timing and volume. Our findings have major importance for water security assessment in the Canadian Prairies and contribute to better understanding of feedbacks in coupled Natural-Human water systems during the current Anthropocene.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we developed the Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS) to fill the gap between complex, spatially distributed models which are often used in lowland regions and simple, parametric models which have mostly been developed for mountainous catchments. This parametric rainfall-runoff model can be used all over the world, both in freely draining lowland catchments and polders with controlled water levels. Here, we present the model implementation and our recent experience in training students and practitioners to use the model.\nWALRUS has several advantages that facilitate practical application. Firstly, WALRUS is computationally efficient, which allows for operational forecasting and uncertainty estimation by running ensembles. Secondly, the code is set-up such that it can be used by both practitioners and researchers. For direct use by practitioners, defaults are implemented for relations between model variables and for the computation of initial conditions based on discharge only, leaving only four parameters which require calibration. For research purposes, the defaults can easily be changed. Finally, an approach for flexible time steps increases numerical stability and makes model parameter values independent of time step size, which facilitates use of the model with the same parameter set for multi-year water balance studies as well as detailed analyses of individual flood peaks.\nThe open source model code is currently implemented in R and compiled into a package. This package will be made available through the R CRAN server. A small massive open online course (MOOC) is being developed to give students, researchers and practitioners a step-by-step WALRUS-training. This course contains explanations about model elements and its advantages and limitations, as well as hands-on exercises to learn how to use WALRUS. All code, course, literature and examples will be collected on a dedicated website, which can be found via www.wageningenur.nl/hwm.\n",

            "abstract": "The East African Rift System was initiated by the impingement of the Afar mantle plume on the base of the non-cratonic continental lithosphere (assembled during the Pan-African Orogeny), producing over 300,000 km3 [1] of continental flood basalts ~30 Ma ago. The contribution of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) to this voluminous period of volcanism is implied based on basaltic geochemical and isotopic data. However, the role of percolating melts on the SCLM composition is less clear. Metasomatism is capable of hybridizing or overprinting the geochemical signature of the SCLM. In addition, models suggest that adding fluids to lithospheric mantle affects its stability [e.g. 2, 3]. We investigated the nature of the SCLM using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) to measure water content in mantle xenoliths entrained in young (1 Ma) basaltic lavas from the Ethiopian volcanic province. The mantle xenoliths consist dominantly of spinel lherzolites and are composed of nominally anhydrous minerals, which can contain trace water as H in mineral defects. Eleven mantle xenoliths come from the Injibara-Gojam region and two from the Mega-Sidamo region. Water abundances of olivines in six samples are 1-5ppm H2O while the rest are below the limit of detection (<0.5 ppm H2O); orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene contain 80-238 and 111-340 ppm wt H2O, respectively. Two xenoliths have higher water contents – a websterite (470 ppm) and dunite (229 ppm), consistent with involvement of ascending melts. The low water content of the upper SCLM beneath Ethiopia is as dry as the oceanic mantle [2] except for small domains represented by percolating melts. Consequently, rifting of the East African lithosphere may not have been facilitated by a hydrated upper mantle. [1] Hoffman et al., 1997 Nature 389, 838–841.

            "abstract": "Greenland’s fast-flowing tidewater outlet glaciers play a critical role in modulating the ice sheet’s contribution to sea level rise. Increasing evidence points to the importance of ocean forcing at the marine margins as a control on outlet glacier behavior, but a process-based understanding of glacier–ocean interactions remains elusive in part because our current capabilities for observing and quantifying system behavior at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales are limited. A recent international workshop on Greenland’s marine terminating glaciers (US CLIVAR, Beverly, MA, June 2013) recommended the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring network covering Greenland’s largest outlet glacier–fjord systems to collect long-term time series of critical in situ glaciological, oceanographic and atmospheric parameters needed to understand evolving relationships between different climate forcings and glacier flow. Given the remote locations and harsh environments of Greenland’s glacial fjords, the development of robust autonomous instrumentation is a key step in making the observing networks a reality.\nThis presentation discusses the design and development of a fully-autonomous ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for monitoring outlet glacier behavior. Initial deployment of the system is planned for spring 2015 at Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland. The instrument will acquire multi-dimensional point-cloud measurements of the mélange, terminus, and lower-reaches of the glacier. The heart of the system is a long-range, 1064 nm wavelength Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) that we have previously used in campaign-style surveys at Helheim Glacier and at Hubbard Glacier in Alaska. We draw on this experience to design and fabricate the power and enclosure components of the new system, and use previously acquired data from the instrument, collected August 2013 and July 2014 at Helheim, to optimize our data collection strategy and design the data processing and telemetry subsystems to ensure year-round data collection.",

            "abstract": "The most well-known example of a CO2-driven geyser is Crystal geyser in Green River, Utah. In situ monitoring of pressure and temperature and analysis of the elemental and isotopic composition of the emanating fluids has provided useful proxies for determining the geysering cycle, the source of water/CO2 and furthermore the physical constraints at depth which ultimately control the surficial expressions. Crystal geyser is the first geyser in the world which has been shown to go through repeated systematic chemical variations during its eruption cycle. The eruption cycle at Crystal geyser is comprised of 4 parts which follow the order of: minor eruption period (mEP), major eruption period (MEP), aftershock eruptions (Ae) and recharge period (R). Minor eruption periods are characterized by increasing specific conductivity (19.3 to 21.2 mS/cm), Na and Cl concentrations during the first half which plateau until the MEP. The beginning of the MEP denotes a sharp drop in temperature (17.4 to 16.8 ºC) Na, Cl, specific conductivity (21.2 to 18 mS/cm), and increasing concentrations of Fe, Sr, Ca, Mg and Mn. Downhole fluid sampling of the Entrada Sandstone and Navajo Sandstone provided 1 and 4 samples from the aquifers, respectively. The Entrada Sandstone in comparison to the deeper Navajo Sandstone has elevated concentrations of Sr and Fe and has lower concentrations of Na and Cl. Inverse modeling using the chemical characteristics of the Entrada Sandstone, Navajo Sandstone and brine was executed to determine the fractional inputs which comprise Crystal geyser’s fluid. Variances in the fractional contribution are dependent on the depth of the sample chosen to be representative of the Navajo Sandstone because the concentration of Na and Cl, among other elements, changes over depth. During the mEP the Navajo Sandstone, Entrada Sandstone and brine supply 50-55%, 44-48% and 1-3% of the total fluid, respectively. During the MEP the Navajo Sandstone, Entrada Sandstone and brine supply 39-43%, 56-59% and 1-2%, respectively. The results imply that the type of geysering seen at the surface is a function of the physical hydrologic characteristics of the supplying formations.",

            "abstract": "The eastern Tennessee seismic zone (ETSZ) may represent reactivation of an ancient shear zone that accommodated left-lateral, transpressive motion of the Amazon craton during the Grenville orogeny. Several different lines of evidence support this concept including velocity models for the crust, earthquake hypocenter alignments, focal mechanism solutions, potential field anomalies, paleomagnetic pole positions, and isotopic geochemical studies. The ETSZ trends NE-SW for about 300 km and displays remarkable correlation with the prominent New York – Alabama (NY-AL) aeromagnetic lineament. Vp and Vs models for the crust derived from a local ETSZ earthquake tomography study reveal the presence of a narrow, NE-SW trending, steeply dipping zone of low velocities that extends to a depth of at least 24 km and is associated with the vertical projection of the NY-AL aeromagnetic lineament. The low velocity zone is interpreted as a major basement fault. The recent Mw 4.2 Perry County eastern Kentucky earthquake occurred north of the ETSZ but has a focal depth and mechanism that are similar to those for ETSZ earthquakes. We investigate the possibility that the proposed ancient shear zone extends into eastern Kentucky using Bouguer and aeromagnetic maps. The southern end of the ETSZ is characterized by hypocenters that align along planes dipping at roughly 45 degrees and focal mechanisms that contain large normal faulting components. The NY-AL aeromagnetic lineament also changes trend in the southern end of the ETSZ and the exact location of the lineament is ambiguous. We suggest that the southern portion of the ETSZ involves reactivation of reverse faults (now as normal faults) that mark the ancient transition between a collisional to a more transpressive boundary between Amazonia and Laurentia during the formation of the super continent Rodinia.",

            "abstract": "Ps converted waves recorded by 29 stations deployed from 2007 to 2011 are used to develop constraints on the crustal velocity discontinuities beneath western Tibet. We use the frequency-domain multiple-taper correlation (MTC) algorithm (Park and Levin, 2000) to develop receiver functions (RFs), and plot back-azimuth and epicentral gathers to identify clear converted waves beneath our study area.\nTo evaluate depths of major converting boundaries we use a S-wave velocity model of Gilligan et al., (2014), and the P-wave velocity model of Razi et al., (2014). From these models, we compute vertically averaged ratios of Vp and Vs for the crust beneath each site. We find Vp/Vs ratios vary between 1.71 and 1.8, with sites showing the high Vp/Vs ratio (1.75-1.8) concentrated along the plate boundary between India and Eurasia. The Vp/Vs ratio is lower in the Lhasa block (1.71-1.75), while south of the Indus-Yarlung suture (IYS), the highest Vp/Vs ratio (1.8) is observed.\nWe observe strong positive Ps converted phases attributable to the Moho with Ps-Ptimes ranging from 5.3 s south of the IYS to 10.1 s north of the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS), with corresponding range of crustal thicknesses of 41-82 km. Within the Lhasa block the Moho appears at 65-80 km depths. However, south of the IYS the crust is 43-60 km. We find the thickest crust north of the BNS at 82 km.\nAdditionally, at many locations our RFs contain another positive phase with Ps-Ptimes of 5-7 s, corresponding to an interface at 40-55 km. This phase is seen mostly beneath the sites along the Karakoram fault (KKF). The relative timing between this phase and the later one delimiting the extent of the crust is in 2-3 s range, implying a ~20 km thick layer in the lower part of the crust bounded by two sharp increases in seismic impedance.\nOur results also show coherent negative phases at some of the sites, mostly along the KKF. Ps-P delays of 2-5 s suggest boundaries at mid-crustal depths, and negative polarity indicates low velocity beneath them, a finding broadly consistent with vertical profiles of Vs in the model of Gilligan et al. (2014). A lack of the corresponding zone of low Vp velocities in the model of Razi et al. (2014) suggests that the origin of low Vs is not thermal. A plausible alternate is systematic sub-horizontal texture of the rocks aligned in the course of the formation of the plateau.",

            "abstract": "The Cordillera Blanca, Peru, has the highest concentration of glaciers in the tropics. These glaciers, which in some valleys provide up to 70% of the dry season runoff, are rapidly retreating, with potential impacts on water resources. To predict the future changes in water resource in the region, it is important to better understand the processes driving tropical glacier ablation at the headwater of these systems. However, due to the glaciers’ high altitude and the remote location, new techniques are needed to investigate these processes. Here we use high-definition ground-based infrared thermal imagery, paired with traditional weather monitoring instruments located on and adjacent to the glacier, to obtain high temporal and spatial resolution temperature maps of the surface of the Cuchillacocha glacier in the Cordillera Blanca. For four consecutive dry seasons (July 2011-2014), 24 to 48 hours of time-lapse imagery (5-30 minute spacing) of the glacier surface and surrounding area were acquired in conjunction with climate data. We compare the spatial and temporal variability of the surface temperature with numerous factors, including the surface conditions (e.g. ice, firn, debris cover, etc.), the thermal gradient at the edge of the glacier and with night time radiative cooling under different atmospheric conditions. The results show that sub-daily fluctuations in runoff from the glacier can be explained in large part by the incoming solar radiation and that the heating not only of the ice surface, but the surround bedrock, are important controls on the rate of meltwater generation. This study shows the potential utility for collecting and analyzing ground based infrared imagery for glacier studies, with implications for hydrologic and water resource applications.",

The version of the algorithm used for both BrO includes relevant changes with respect to the operational code, including the fit of the O2-O2 collisional complex, updates in the high resolution solar reference spectrum, updates in spectroscopy, an updated Air Mass Factor (AMF) calculation scheme, and the inclusion of scattering weights and vertical profiles in the level 2 products. Updates to the algorithms include accurate scattering weights and air mass factor calculations, scattering weights and profiles in outputs and available cross sections. We include retrieval parameter and window optimization to reduce the interference from O3, HCHO, O2-O2, SO2, improve fitting accuracy and uncertainty, reduce striping, and improve the long-term stability.\nWe validate OMI BrO with ground-based measurements from Harestua and with chemical transport model simulations.

PRISMA is an Earth observation system with innovative electro-optical instrumentation which combines an hyperspectral sensor with a panchromatic medium-resolution camera.

The volcanic calibration and validation activities comprise the managing of a large amount of in situ hyperspectral data collected during the last 10 years. The usability and interoperability of these datasets represents a task of ASI-AGI project. For this purpose a database has been created to collect all the spectral signatures of the measured volcanic surfaces. This process has begun with the creation of the metadata structure compliant with those belonging to some standard spectral libraries such as USGS ones. Each spectral signature is described in a table containing ancillary data such as the location map of where it was collected, description of the target selected, etc. The relational database structure has been developed WOVOdat compliant. Specific tables have been formatted for each type of measurements, instruments and targets in order to query the database through a user-friendly web-interface. The interface has an upload area to populate the database and a visualization tool that allows downloading the ASCII spectral file and also visualizing an interactive graph where the spectral range to plot can be selected by the user.",

            "abstract": "Paleogeographic and tectonic reconstructions in the Barberton greenstone belt (BGB) are challenged by syn- and post-depositional tectonics. The Barberton Drilling Project extracted two drill cores from the sedimentary rocks of the 3.26-3.22 Ga Mapepe Formation of the Fig Tree Group. The cores were taken from the Manzimnyama Syncline (BARB4) and the Barite Valley structural belt (BARB5), which are separated by belts of faulted older Onverwacht and younger Moodies strata. Stratigraphically, there is no clear correlation of Mapape strata in these two belts. Both BARB4 and BARB5 contain 25 to 300 m thick units of lithic sandstone that may represent correlative units. A comparative provenance analysis allows testing a possible correlation and evaluating the nature of tectonic uplifts that sourced the sediments. The sandstones have experienced pervasive metasomatic alteration and most primary silicate minerals except coarse quartz have been transformed into micromosaics of microquartz, phyllosilicates, and trace impurities. The majority of framework grains are chert, impure chert, and lithic grains while monocrystalline quartz and altered feldspar are minor components. The single thick sandstone in BARB4 displays a relatively uniform framework mode with average 38.7 % total quartz, 2.4% feldspars, and 58.9 % lithics and an increasing percentage of mafic to ultramafic grains upsection. In contrast, BARB5 includes three distinct sandstones with varying framework modes. The litharenite at 0 to 95m core depth was mainly sourced from an immediately underlying dacitic tuff. The chertarenite at 320 to 390m core depth is composed of 73% carbonaceous chert grains. All grain types appear to have been derived by erosion of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the BGB as well as penecontemporaneous volcanism. Erosion did not reach deeper-seated plutonic rocks. The framework mode of the BARB4 sandstones represents a composite of common silicified BGB rocks and resembles those of other sediments in the southern domain of the BGB. In contrast, BARB5 sandstones derived locally by shallow erosion of underlying volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The distinct signatures suggest that these units are not correlative and were not derived from a common source. They may be a result of local uplifts of different parts of the greenstone sequence.",

            "abstract": "Fires in anthropogenically-dominated landscapes are generally attributed to ecosystem management, agriculture, and policy drivers. In European Russia, fire mainly occurring on agricultural lands, wetlands, and abandoned lands. In the agricultural practice in Russia prescribed fires are believed to increase pasture and hay productivity, suppress trees and shrub expansion, and reduce fire hazards, with fire frequency fire dependent on land use and agricultural practices. The large-scale socio-economic transition since the fall of the Soviet Union has led to changes in land use and land management, including land abandonment and changing agricultural practices. In June 2014, an extensive field campaign was completed in the Smolensk Oblast, located approximately two hundred kilometers west of Moscow on the border with Belarus. Our field sampling was based on circa 1985 Landsat-based forest cover map (Potapov et al., 2014). Points were randomly selected from the non-forested class of the 1985 classification, prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Of total field collects, 55% points were sampled on land in either early or late stage of abandonment, 15% from actively cropped fields, and 30% from hay or pasture. Fire frequency was calculated for the 108 field points using 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire data for years 2000-2014. Also we calculated percent of points burned in spring 2014 using 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to derive burn scars. Actively cropped fields had lowest burn frequency while abandoned lands - early and late stage abandonment - had highest frequency. Fire frequency was significantly higher on wet soils than dry soils, with no relationship between fire frequency and tree canopy cover. We hypothesize, higher fire frequency on abandoned lands was likely due to greater fuel loads and because of traditional belief in rural Russia that fire is efficient way to suppress tree and shrub expansion.",

            "abstract": "In the Middle East, dust and sand storms are a persistent problem and can deliver significant amounts of micro-particulates via inhalation into the mouth, nasal pharynx, & lungs due to the fine size and abundance of these micro-particulates. The chronic and acute health risks of this dust inhalation have not been well studied nor has the dust been effectively characterized as to its chemical composition, mineral content, or microbial flora. Scientific experiments were designed to study the Kuwaiti and Iraqi dust as to its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and for its potential to cause adverse health effects. First, dust samples from different locations were collected and processed and exposure data collected. Initial chemical and physical characterization of each sample including particle size distribution and inorganic analysis was conducted, followed by characterization of biologic flora of the dust, including bacteria, fungi and viruses.\nData indicates that the mineralized dust is composed of calcium carbonate over a matrix of metallic silicate nanocrystals containing a variety of trace and heavy metals constituting ~3 % of the PM10 particles by weight, of which ~1% is bioaccessible aluminum and reactive iron, each. The particles also consist of ~1% bioavailable aluminum and reactive iron each. Microbial analysis reveals a significant biodiversity of bacterial, fungi, and viruses of which ~30% are known pathogens. Of the microbes identified, several have hemolytic properties and most have significant antibiotic resistance. Viral analysis indicates a tremendous amount of virons with a large percent of RNA viruses. The level of total suspended particle mass at PM 10 along with environmental & physiological conditions present constitute an excessive exposure to micro-particulates including PM 2.5 and the potential for adverse health effects. Reported data on cell culture and animal studies have indicated a high level of toxicity to these dust particles. Taken together, these data suggest that at the level of dust exposure commonly found in the Middle East (i.e., Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan), in addition to the microbial and metal content of the mineralized dust, constitutes a significant health risk, both acute and chronic, to deployed troops and native inhabitants.",

            "abstract": "Fire activity has increased across the boreal forest biome in conjuction with climate warming and drying. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, there has been great interest in understanding feedbacks between a changing fire regime and climate warming. An important mechanism by which increased fire activity may alter boreal C balance is by consuming the soil organic layer (SOL). Fire removal of the SOL may alter germination microsites and tree recruitment, thereby altering forest successional trajectories and C accumulation and storage. In permafrost soils, loss of the insulating SOL can increase soil temperature and active layer depth, impacting growth and survival conditions for both soil microbes and vegetation. To assess fire severity effects on permafrost soils and tree recruitment, we conducted plot-level experimental burns in July 2012 in a larch forest near Cherskii, Siberia. We achieved four burn severity treatments based on residual SOL depths: control, low (> 8 cm), moderate (5-8 cm), and high severity (2-5 cm). For two growing seasons post-fire, we measured thaw depth, soil moisture, and soil temperature. We sowed larch seeds in fall 2012 and 2013 and quantified seedling establishment and vegetation re-growth for two growing seasons. Immediately post-fire, thaw depth increased rapidly with increasing fire severity, and this trend has persisted for two years. In 2013 and 2014, thaw depth was ~ 40 cm deeper in high severity plots compared to controls, likely due to lower summer soil insulation, higher black char cover, and higher surface soil temperatures. We observed little to no larch recruitment in unburned and low severity plots, but new seedling density was ~5 seedlings m-2 in moderate and high severity plots, which had low cover of other vegetation types and high soil moisture. Findings suggest that increased fire severity may increase larch recruitment and provide favorable soil conditions for tree growth. As a consequence, forest density and potential to accumulate and store C in tree biomass will likely increase. The balance between C lost via fire and microbial respiration and C gained due to changes in forest stand structure will determine whether boreal forests represent a C pool or sink under changing fire regimes.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) has been proposed as a valuable new measurement for understanding ecosystem carbon fluxes. Net OCS uptake is thought to be a proxy for gross photosynthetic uptake (which can’t be directly measured at large scales). However, our understanding of the OCS flux within forest ecosystems, and it's relationship to CO2, has been limited by a lack of long-term measurements of the OCS flux. Throughout 2011, the ecosystem flux of OCS was measured at a mid-latitude deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, MA, US), a site of long-term CO2 flux measurements. In order to understand the processes contributing to the seasonal ecosystem fluxes of OCS and CO2, we used the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB). This is an enzyme-kinetic model that couples the carbon cycle to the surface energy, water and radiation balance through stomatal regulation. The model has been extended to include a coupled representation of OCS uptake by leaves and soil. Here we test these parameterizations against the whole suite of ecosystem fluxes (including OCS flux) measured throughout the year. We also evaluate the effect of longer-term processes (such as phenology and soil moisture stress) on inter annual variation in ecosystem flux and OCS exchange.",

            "abstract": "Despite 150 years of investigation of the Bohemian Massif (Central Europe), it is only recently that the investigation of old and new samples displayed the occurrence of tiny portions of crystallized anatectic melt in regional migmatites. These vestiges of magma, called “nanogranites”, are natural probes of the partial melting processes in the crust. Original melt composition and water content can be directly analyzed after piston cylinder re-homogenization. When compared to classic re-melting experiments, nanogranites are ideal “natural” experimental charges of anatectic melt. They are encapsulated in peritectic garnet immediately after production – both phases are products of the same partial melting reaction. Sheltered inside garnet, they remain unaffected by the physico-chemical changes which affected the host migmatites during their slow cooling, unlike leucosomes and anatexis-related plutons.\nFive different case studies of nanogranite-bearing high-grade rocks have been identified so far: three in metapelites from the Moldanubian Zone, and two in metagranitoids from the Granulitgebirge and Orlica–Śnieżnik Dome. Their characterization provides insights into how the continental crust melts at different depths, from shallow levels to mantle depths, during different moments of its metamorphic history (prograde vs. decompressional melting). For example, the investigation and experimental re-melting of nanogranites from Grt+Ky leucogranulites (Orlica–Śnieżnik Dome) recently provided evidence of prograde melting of metagranitoids under eclogite-facies conditions (T≥875°C and P~2.7 GPa), close to the stability field of coesite. The melt generated is granitic, hydrous (6 wt% H2O) and metaluminous (ASI=1.03), and is at the moment the “deepest” glass obtained through re-homogenization of primary polycrystalline inclusions in natural rocks. This work confirms that nanogranites in migmatites 1) are a powerful tool to constrain anatexis in natural rocks, and 2) can be found, re-homogenized and investigated in rocks melted under variable PT conditions, even at mantle depths.",

            "abstract": "What is the best way to foster creative collaborative interdisciplinary research, education and outreach? In the past, proposal solicitations were open-ended, leaving it to the community to assemble relevant expertise and institutions. In several recent solicitations, the National Science Foundation has required inclusion of specific expertise. For example, the Climate Change Education Partnership solicitation stated, “Each CCEP is required to include substantial involvement of representatives from each of the following communities: climate scientists; experts in the learning sciences; and, practitioners from within formal or informal education venues. This combined expertise is intended to foster innovative, trans-disciplinary advances in climate change education … Additional types of expertise are allowed, but these three required areas must form the core partnership.”\nAn Interdisciplinary Collaboration Survey of the Polar Learning and Responding: PoLAR CCEP (http://thepolarhub.org/) implemented by Goodman Research Group, the project’s evaluators, assessed the PoLAR Partnership to determine if the collaboration is effective and to understand how the experience affects the partners themselves. The data showed that the NSF goal of fostering innovative teams is being met: “It has brought me into contact with new people, ideas, and approaches that are on the cutting edge and that can be applied not only to this project …” Expertise is distributed within and across the partners with most working in three to four of the required areas (climate science, learning science, formal and/or informal education), and they seek advice from partners across the four areas. Partners experience both personal and professional benefits, including increased satisfaction with their own current work and research, and they anticipate continued work with this group of colleagues on this, as well as future projects.\nThis analysis of partnership development and implementation advances understanding of how the diverse but complementary backgrounds of our partners are leading to new connections, bridging different academic fields, and positioning the partnership with the critical mass necessary to tackle challenges with innovative, novel approaches.",

            "abstract": "Although sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies in the Western Pacific have long been known as part of the classic Southern Oscillation pattern associated with ENSO, there is an unresolved question regarding the dynamics that maintains these. Contrary to traditional studies that assume a single deep baroclinic mode for ENSO response in the tropics, the SLP anomalies in the western Pacific are spatially well separated from the baroclinic signal associated with the tropospheric temperature anomalies in NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, CMIP5 models, and an intermediate complexity model [a quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation model (QTCM)]. Separation of the SLP into its baroclinic and barotropic components indicates that the baroclinic mode SLP contributions are in the central and eastern Pacific (coincident with the temperature anomalies), whereas the western Pacific SLP anomalies arise primarily from barotropic mode contributions.\nIn a set of QTCM experiments, we suppress anomalies in baroclinic-barotropic interaction terms, i.e., anomalies of the barotropic Rossby wave source, over successively wider latitudinal bands in the tropical Pacific, to diagnose their effects on the SLP anomalies in the western Pacific associated with ENSO. In the 15°N-15°S experiment, the pressure signals in the western Pacific are only partly suppressed, whereas in the 30°N-30°S suppression experiment, the anomalies in the western Pacific are almost entirely removed. This suggests the following pathway: interactions with SST anomalies create the baroclinic mode signal in the central and Eastern Pacific, but baroclinic-barotropic interactions, arising substantially in the subtropical Pacific, create a barotropic response that is yields the SLP anomaly pattern in the western Pacific.",

            "abstract": "The ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator (ACES) is an Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave lidar system recently developed at NASA Langley Research Center that seeks to advance technologies and techniques critical to measuring atmospheric column carbon dioxide (CO2) mixing ratios in support of the NASA Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. These advancements include: (1) increasing the power-aperture product to approach ASCENDS mission requirements by implementing multi-aperture telescopes and multiple co-aligned laser transmitters; (2) incorporating high-efficiency, high-power Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs); (3) developing and incorporating a high-bandwidth, low-noise HgCdTe detector and transimpedence amplifier (TIA) subsystem capable of long-duration operation on Global Hawk aircraft, and (4) advancing algorithms for cloud and aerosol discrimination. The ACES instrument architecture is being developed for operation on high-altitude aircraft and will be directly scalable to meet the ASCENDS mission requirements.\nACES simultaneously transmits five laser beams: three from commercial EDFAs operating near 1571 nm, and two from the Exelis oxygen (O2) Raman fiber laser amplifier system operating near 1260 nm. The Integrated-Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar approach is used at both wavelengths to independently measure the CO2 and O2 column number densities and retrieve the average column CO2 mixing ratio. The outgoing laser beams are aligned to the field of view of ACES’ three fiber-coupled 17.8-cm diameter athermal telescopes. The backscattered light collected by the three telescopes is sent to the detector/TIA subsystem, which has a bandwidth of 4.7 MHz and operates service-free using a tactical dewar and cryocooler. Two key laser modulation approaches are being tested to significantly mitigate the effects of thin clouds on the retrieved CO2 column amounts.\nFull instrument development concluded in the spring of 2014. After ground range tests of the instrument, ACES successfully completed six test flights on the Langley Hu-25 aircraft in July, 2014, and recorded data at multiple altitudes over land and ocean surfaces with and without intervening clouds. Preliminary results from these flights will be presented in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) accounts for a substantial fraction of tropospheric aerosol and has significant impacts on climate and human health. Results from the CARES (Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative Effects Study) field mission suggested that isoprene oxidation moderated by anthropogenic emissions plays a dominant role in SOA formation, but current literature isoprene yields and oxidation mechanisms are unable to explain the CARES observations. In this study, we conducted a series of continuous-flow chamber experiments to investigate the yield and chemical composition of SOA formed from isoprene photo-oxidation as a function of NOx concentration. Under low-NOx (< 1ppbv) conditions, we measure SOA mass yields that are significantly larger than previously reported, reaching up to 20%, and the yields are strongly dependent on H2O2 concentrations. The higher yields are likely a result of differences between batch mode and continuous-flow experiments and the photochemical fate of the ISOPOOH intermediate under the high HO2 conditions of the chamber experiments. Online analysis of the SOA using the University of Washington FIGAERO HR-ToF-CIMS instrument shows that a C5H12O6 compound can explain a significant fraction of the mass measured by the AMS. We tentatively identify this compound as a dihydroxy dihydroperoxide produced from the oxidation of ISOPOOH. To our knowledge, we believe this represents the most direct confirmation that such dihydroperoxides form during isoprene oxidation and contribute to SOA. A van Krevelen analysis of HR-AMS data is consistent with hydroperoxide species forming the majority of the SOA. As progressively more NO was added to the system, yields initially increase to a maximum at an NO:isoprene ratio of ~1, and then rapidly decrease, to 3.6% at an NO:isoprene ratio of 4. As NO concentrations increased, alkyl nitrates accounts for an increasing portion of the SOA mass, though hydroperoxides remain significant. These observations of increased yields and the elucidation of isoprene oxidation pathways will allow for more accurate predictions of organic aerosol formation from the photochemical oxidation of isoprene in the ambient atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Essential Principles of Climate Science Literacy states that a climate-literate individual can: “understand the essential principles of Earth’s climate system, assess scientifically credible information about climate change, communicate about climate and climate change in a meaningful way, and make informed and responsible decisions with regard to actions that may affect climate.” We argue that further integration of the social science dimensions of climate change will advance the climate literacy goals of communication and responsible actions. The underlying rationale for this argues: 1) teaching the habits of mind and scientific practices that have synergies across the social and natural sciences can strengthen students ability to understand and assess science in general and that 2) understanding the empirical research on the social, political, and economic processes (including climate science itself) that are part of the climate system is an important step for enabling effective action and communication. For example, while climate literacy has often identified the public’s faulty mental models of climate processes as a partial explanation of complacency, emerging research suggests that the public’s mental models of the social world are equally or more important in leading to informed and responsible climate decisions. Building student’s ability to think across the social and natural sciences by understanding “how we know what we know” through the sciences and a scientific understanding of the social world allows us to achieve climate literacy goals more systematically and completely. To enable this integration we first identify the robust social science insights for the climate science literacy principles that involve social systems. We then briefly identify significant social science contributions to climate science literacy that do not clearly fit within the seven climate literacy principles but arguably could advance climate literacy goals. We conclude with suggestions on how the identified social science insights could be integrated into climate literacy efforts.",

            "abstract": "The New Horizons (NH) payload includes a Radio Science Experiment (REX) for investigating key characteristics of Pluto and Charon during the upcoming flyby in July 2015. REX flight equipment augments the NH radio transceiver used for spacecraft communications and tracking. The REX hardware implementation requires 1.6 W and 160 g. This presentation will focus on the final design and the predicted performance of two high-priority observations. First, REX will receive signals from a pair of 70-m antennas on Earth – each transmitting 20 kW at 4.2-cm wavelength – during a diametric radio occultation by Pluto. The data recorded by REX will reveal the surface pressure, the temperature structure of the lower atmosphere, and the surface radius. Second, REX will measure the thermal emission from Pluto at 4.2-cm wavelength during two linear scans across the disk at close range when both the dayside and the nightside are visible, allowing the surface temperature and its spatial variations to be determined. Both scans extend from limb to limb with a resolution of about 10 pixels; one bisects Pluto whereas the second crosses the winter pole. We will illustrate the capabilities of REX by reviewing the method of analysis and the precision achieved in a lunar occultation observed by New Horizons in May 2011. Re-analysis of radio occultation measurements by Voyager 2 at Triton is also under way. More generally, REX objectives include a radio occultation search for Pluto’s ionosphere; examination of Charon through both radio occultation and radiometry; a search for a radar echo from Pluto’s surface; and improved knowledge of the Pluto system mass and the Pluto-Charon mass ratio from a combination of two-way and one-way Doppler frequency measurements.",

            "abstract": "The central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ: New Zealand) has produced numerous large-volume high-silica rhyolite eruptions in the past 1.6 Ma. In this study, we focus on two such eruptions, derived from the same area: the 26.5 ka Oruanui- the most recent supereruption in earth’s history- and the 1.8 ka Taupo- the most recent large, rhyolitic eruption from the TVZ. In order to understand the evolution of these crystal-poor magma bodies and constrain their pre-eruptive residence times in the crust, we use x-ray tomography and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize pumice textures in both Oruanui and Taupo. We obtain crystal size distributions (CSDs) using x-ray tomography for three groups of phases: quartz+feldspar, magnetite+ilmenite, and zircon. Quartz+feldspar size distributions from both eruptions show a shallow-sloped log-linear section describing large crystals (>~200 µm), which we interpret as a pre-eruptive crystal population that grew over time under low supersaturation. Magnetite+ilmenite and zircon size distributions are also log-linear, but have fewer crystals and a smaller maximum crystal size (<200 µm). Taupo quartz+feldspar size distributions are kinked at ~200 µm and show a steep-sloped section describing small crystals (<200 µm), which we interpret to represent a crystal population that nucleated and grew during eruptive decompression. In contrast, Oruanui distributions are not kinked. This difference is supported by EDS compositional maps that show a small (20-50 µm) crystal population in Taupo samples, but not in Oruanui samples. This is consistent with rhyolite-MELTS geobarometry results, which indicate the Taupo magma resided at higher pressures (i.e. greater depth) than did the Oruanui magma. As such, Taupo magma had a longer path to eruption and thus more time for crystal nucleation and growth during decompression. Timescales calculated from CSD slopes of the pre-eruptive crystal populations of magnetite, zircon, and quartz+feldspar indicate residence times on the order of decades to centuries, and at most millennia, for both systems. Timescales calculated for the small crystal population (i.e. the onset of eruptive decompression) indicate a maximum timescale of several years.",

            "abstract": "The interpretation of Sm-Nd systematics for the early Earth relies on knowing the composition of the silicate Earth and the 146Sm decay constant. We have measured both 146Sm-142Nd and 147Sm-143Nd internal systematics of four individual Calcium, Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs), the first solids formed in the Solar System [1], from 3 different carbonaceous chondrites from the CV3 group: Allende, Northwest Africa (NWA) 2364 and NWA 6991. Results obtained on NWA 6991 plot on a well-defined mineral and bulk isochron with a Solar System initial 146Sm/144Sm ratio of 0.0070 ±0.0024. This ratio is more consistent with the ratio defined from internal isochrons of differentiated meteorites using the half-life of 103 Ma for 146Sm [2], instead of the value obtained considering the half-life of 68 Ma [3].\nOn the basis of nucleosynthethic anomalies in Sm and Nd isotopes [4], the ordinary (O) and enstatite (E) chondrites remain potential candidates for the Earth’s building blocks. OC have an average deficit of -18±3 ppm relative to modern terrestrial 142Nd/144Nd, whereas EC range from the OC to the terrestrial values [4-6]. Sm stable isotope compositions of the analyzed CAIs indicate that galactic cosmic rays did not affect the 142Nd/144Nd compositions, but deficits are found in the pure p-process 144Sm nuclide (-240 to -290 ppm/ standard). These deficits may translate to 142Nd deficits of a few ppm. NWA 6991 CAI 146Sm-142Nd internal isochron passes through a 142Nd/144Nd ratio of -6 ±6 ppm relative to the terrestrial standard at a chondritic 147Sm/144Nd of 0.1960. We note that this value is identical to the enstatite chondrite average and the 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the lunar mantle, as defined recently by [7] using a chondritic Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf for the bulk Moon. While the determination of the Sm-Nd reference parameters for the bulk Earth is still contentious, the difference in 142Nd/144Nd between modern terrestrial rocks and meteorites analyzed so far is <10ppm.\n[1] Bouvier and Wadhwa (2010) Nat.

            "abstract": "Rivers worldwide are net processors of organic matter(OM), driving the evasive flux of CO2 from inland waters. The Amazon River outgases nearly 0.5PgC/yr, much of which is thought to be driven by the in-situ respiration of terrestrially-derived OM. However, the substrates fueling this respiration and the processes governing it remain fairly unconstrained.\nHere, we chose to examine the roles of in-situ algal and floodplain macrophyte production in fueling respiration in the lower Amazon River. Contrary to the previous assumptions of turbid, tropical rivers, δ18O-O2 data revealed the presence of photosynthetic O2 throughout the main stem of the lower Amazon. This data was used in a steady-state model to estimate the Respiration to Production(R:P) ratio at these sites. This model reveals a low R:P, even at the mouth of the Amazon. Diel O2measurements were made to test this steady-state assumption, revealing little variation over a 24 hour cycle.\nδ18O-O2 and δ13C-DIC data was combined with in-situ, continuous measurements of CO2 and O2 to show spatial trends in respiration and production. The floodplains and adjacent river margins had elevated δ18O(indicating higher photosynthetic input) and δ13C(indicating respiration of C4 macrophytes). Continuous CO2 and O2 measurements revealed that these sites were “hot spots” for respiration, with low O2 saturation and elevated pCO2 fueled by the input of macrophytic OM . Results reveal the importance of spatial dynamics in understanding respiration within large, tidal rivers.",

            "abstract": "Early Earth had a higher amount of remaining radiogenic elements as well as a higher amount of leftover primordial heat. Both contributed to the increased temperature in the Earth’s interior and it is mainly this increased mantle potential temperature ΔTp that controls the dynamics of the crust and upper mantle and the style of Early Earth tectonics.\nFor a minor increase in temperature ΔTp < 175 K a subduction-collision style ensues which is largely similar to present day plate tectonics. For a moderate increase in ΔTp = 175-250 K subduction can still occur, however plates are strongly weakened and buckling, delamination and Rayleigh-Taylor style dripping of the plate is observed in addition. For higher temperatures ΔTp > 250 K no subduction can be observed anymore and tectonics is dominated by delamination and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.\nWe conduct 3D petrological-thermomechanical numerical modelling experiments of the crust and upper mantle under Early Earth conditions and a plume tectonics model setup. For varying crustal structures and an increased mantle potential temperature ΔTp, a thermal anomaly in the bottom temperature boundary introduces a plume. The model is able to self-sufficiently form depleted mantle lithosphere after repeated melt removal. New crust can be produced in the form of volcanics or plutonics. To simulate differentiation the newly formed crust can have a range in composition from basaltic over dacitic to granitic depending on its source rock.\nModels show large amounts of subcrustal decompression melting and consequently large amounts of new formed crust which in turn influences the dynamics. Mantle and crust are convecting separately. Dome-shaped plutons of mafic or felsic composition can be observed in the crust. Between these domes elongated belts of upper crust, volcanics and sediments are formed. These structures look similar to, for example, the Kaapvaal craton in South Africa where the elongated shape of the Barberton Greenstone Belt is surrounded by multiple plutons.",

Our subcolumn scheme uses the Subgrid Importance Latin Hypercube Sampler (SILHS) to generate profiles of moisture, temperature, vertical velocity and cloud condensate through sampling the multivariate PDF used by the Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (CLUBB) parameterization.\nThe subcolumn profiles created by the SILHS generator are an explicit representation of the sub-grid variability predicted by the CLUBB moist turbulence parameterization. The CAM microphysics scheme runs on each subcolumn, and the resulting heat and moisture tendencies are averaged and returned to the large scale model. We will show results of global atmospheric simulations with CAM, where the convection and microphysics schemes are coupled through this explicit representation of sub-grid variability.",

            "abstract": "Citizens living in areas of shale-gas development such as the Marcellus gas play in Pennsylvania and surrounding states are cognizant of the possibility that drilling and production of natural gas -- including hydraulic fracturing -- may have environmental impacts on their water. The Critical Zone is defined as the zone from vegetation canopy to the lower limits of groundwater. This definition is nebulous in terms of the lower limit, and yet, defining the bottom of the Critical Zone is important if citizens are to embrace shale-gas development. This is because, although no peer-reviewed study has been presented that documents a case where hydraulic fracturing or formation fluids have migrated upwards from fracturing depths to drinking water resources, a few cases of such leakage have been alleged. On the other hand, many cases of methane migration into aquifers have been documented to occur and some have been attributed to shale-gas development. The Critical Zone science community has a role to play in understanding such contamination problems, how they unfold, and how they should be ameliorated. For example, one big effort of the Critical Zone science community is to promote sharing of data describing the environment. This data effort has been extended to provide data for citizens to understand water quality by a team known as the Shale Network. As scientists learn to publish data online, these efforts must also be made accessible to non-scientists. As citizens access the data, the demand for data will grow and all branches of government will eventually respond by providing more accessible data that will help the public and policy-makers make decisions.",

But these are abstract concepts until the consequences of such events are examined at the local level. Further, helping communities come to grips with what this means for building their climate resilience is better understood when multiple factors are considered. This presentation is based on a recent set of case studies about what happened in six communities that experienced one or more extreme events. Multiple interactions affect the outcome of actions taken by a variety of water-related jurisdictions, including those managing drinking water and wastewater utilities, water supply and flood control, and ecosystem and endangered species protection. Two of the case studies will be presented, showing the interdependent and cascading impacts challenging drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater utility managers and others within the watershed. Despite the unique attributes of each region, several common themes emerged from the case studies including how decisions are made, what information was used to inform decisions, what institutional dynamics helped or hindered, and how water resource managers (and their communities) are planning to deal with extreme events in the future.",

            "abstract": "Interest in the geochemistry of tungsten (W) in the environment is on the rise in part due to the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) recent recognition that it represents an emerging contaminant of environmental concern. As such, we undertook a multi-year investigation of W in groundwaters and surface waters to help augment the relatively sparse understanding of the biogeochemistry of W in environmental waters. We quantified W concentrations in natural waters and sediments from a variety of settings, including shallow and deep groundwater flow systems, river waters, estuaries, and marine sediments and associated porewaters. In addition, we measured the equilibrium constants for the formation of thiotungstate ions in laboratory experiments to investigate the possible formation of these thioanions in sulfidic waters. Earlier investigations showed that the chemically similar element molybdenum (Mo) forms thiomolybdate ions in sulfidic waters. Our investigations indicate that pH-related adsorption/desorption reactions and the available quantity of Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide minerals in substrate sediments are important controls on the amount of dissolved W in the environment with higher pH and lower Fe(III) oxide/oxyhydroxide content both favoring greater W mobility. Moreover, W is mobile in oxic, suboxic, and anoxic, including sulfidic waters occurring as the tungstate oxyanion and/or various thiotungstate anions depending of the dissolved sulfide concentrations. Specifically, thiotungstate anions predominate over the tungstate oxyanion for natural waters where dissolved sulfide concentrations attain millimolal levels. Investigation of sediments from a Louisiana salt marsh indicates that W is sequestered into pyrite similar to Mo.",

Protecting and restoring these ecosystems around the globe will help maintain all the societal benefits these ecosystems provide including the natural climate mitigation benefits, but also the food security, water quality, and storm protection benefits that enhance coastal communities and economies.\nThis presentation will focus on some emerging policy opportunities including: (1) incorporation of coastal wetland carbon in U.S. national climate, resilience, and conservation efforts; (2) potential steps to incorporate coastal wetlands in national greenhouse gas inventories as suggested by the 2013 International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement; and (3) dialogue at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) about blue carbon habitats and their potential for inclusion.

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and partners are transitioning from test-user trials of a demonstration earthquake early warning system (ShakeAlert) to deciding and preparing how to implement the release of earthquake early warning information, alert messages, and products to the public and other stakeholders. An earthquake early warning system uses seismic station networks to rapidly gather information about an occurring earthquake and send notifications to user devices ahead of the arrival of potentially damaging ground shaking at their locations. Earthquake early warning alerts can thereby allow time for actions to protect lives and property before arrival of damaging shaking, if users are properly educated on how to use and react to such notifications.\nA collaboration team of risk communications researchers and earth scientists is researching the effectiveness of a chosen subset of potential earthquake early warning interface designs and messages, which could be displayed on a device such as a smartphone. Preliminary results indicate, for instance, that users prefer alerts that include 1) a map to relate their location to the earthquake and 2) instructions for what to do in response to the expected level of shaking.\nA number of important factors must be considered to design a message that will promote appropriate self-protective behavior. While users prefer to see a map, how much information can be processed in limited time? Are graphical representations of wavefronts helpful or confusing? The most important factor to promote a helpful response is the predicted earthquake intensity, or how strong the expected shaking will be at the user’s location. Unlike Japanese users of early warning, few Californians are familiar with the earthquake intensity scale, so we are exploring how differentiating instructions between intensity levels (e.g., “Be aware” for lower shaking levels and “Drop, cover, hold on” at high levels) can be paired with self-directed supplemental information to increase the public’s understanding of earthquake shaking and protective behaviors.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, use of engineered micromodels to investigate pore-scale fluid flow and transport phenomena to better understand and model field-scale observables has steadily increased. Micromodels are thin porous structures in which flow is restricted to two-dimensions and have become common since they are effective, relatively inexpensive tools for visualizing and quantifying complex flow phenomena. We describe a unique micromodel experimental system recently developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The system consists of a pressure chamber, which allows us to conduct experiments at geologic conditions. The maximum working pressure and temperature is 1500 psig and 80° C, respectively, allowing for supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) to be used as a working fluid. Additionally, we have developed micromodels fabricated in geomaterials (e.g., shale and Portland cement), whereas typical micromodels are fabricated in engineered materials such as glass or silicon. The use of geomaterial micromodels allows us to better represent the fluid-rock interactions including wetting angles and chemical reactivity at conditions representative of natural subsurface environments.\nIn this work, we present experimental results in simple fracture systems (e.g., straight channels, pore doublets) with applications to hydrocarbon mobility in hydraulically fractured shale. We use both shale and glass micromodels, allowing for a detailed comparison between flow phenomena in different materials. In the straight channel micromodels, we investigate interfacial velocities and compare the results with theoretical models. In the pore doublet micromodels, we investigate mobilization of oil blobs and contrast the effectiveness of water and scCO2 in the extraction of hydrocarbon from fracture networks. Next, we present experimental results in complex fracture network patterns derived from 3D x-ray tomography images of actual fractures created in shale rock cores. We discuss preliminary analysis aimed at developing quantitative relationships between fluid mobility and interfacial phenomena and the effectiveness of scCO2 as a working fluid.",

With the acceptance of plate tectonics in the late 1960s, he then applied his paleomagnetic tools to study young rocks (mid-ocean ridges), old rocks (the Laurentian shield), and mobile belts (the Appalachians and the Cordillera). In this poster we highlight recent work on several of his methods, results and ideas. Topics will include spherical statistics and paleosecular variation, the geomagnetic polarity time scale and the Kiaman superchron, paleoclimatic tests of paleogeography, compilation of paleomagnetic poles and the definition of apparent polar wander paths, and the paleogeography of cratons (e.g., Pangea) and mobile belts (e.g., Baja BC).",

            "abstract": "A 2011 paper by a group from the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory established that a long- and widely-used method for projecting evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff from the land portions of the Great Lakes basin exhibited severe deficiencies in terms of conservation of energy at the land surface, and consequent errors in projected runoff and lake levels. The key component of this older method is known as the Large Basin Runoff Model (LBRM). A simple alternative method was developed to better account for energy conservation, and this was run for two different general circulation model (GCM) datasets, in order to demonstrate the corresponding discrepancies in terms of ET, runoff, and lake water level. In the Third National Climate Assessment, the regional chapter on the Midwest acknowledged these results, while Appendix 3 (Climate Science Supplement) expressed less credence, with the lead authors of that appendix maintaining that the models needed to be run with more GCMs as input. We will report on the results of runs using more than 40 GCM realizations from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 class. In addition to the previously-used method of adjusting future potential evapotranspiration (PET) according to changes in net radiative energy available at the surface, we introduce one that additionally estimates the air temperature dependence term of the Penman-Monteith formulation, and one in which PET varies in proportion to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation (i.e. PET increases by about 7% per degree C, in contrast to LBRM, in which PET typically increases by 30-50% per degree C).",

The new data product was created to be paired with the long-used, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), emission year 1751-present, one degree latitude by one degree longitude (1x1) mass of emissions data product (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp058/ndp058_v2013.html). Now, for the first time, data users will have FFCO2 emission information that represents both mass and uncertainty, each of which varies in both time and space.\nThe new data product was constructed by examining the individual uncertainties in each of the input data sets to the gridded mass maps and then combining these individual uncertainties into an overall uncertainty for the mass maps. The input data sets include a table of the mass of FFCO2 emissions by country and year, the one degree geographic map of emissions which includes changing borders on an annual time scale and ties the mass of emissions to location, and the one degree population proxy used to distribute the mass of emissions within each country. As the three input data sets are independent of each other, their combination for the overall uncertainty is accomplished by a simple square root of the sum of the squares procedure.\nThe resulting uncertainty data product is gridded at 1x1 and exactly overlays the 1x1 mass emission maps. The default temporal resolution is annual, but a companion product is also available at monthly time scales. The monthly uncertainty product uses the same input data sets, but the mass uncertainty is scaled as described in the monthly mass product description paper (2011, Tellus B, 63:309-327, doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00530.x). The gridded uncertainty maps cover emission year 1950 to 2010. The start year is determined by the mass uncertainty study which began its analysis in 1950. The end year reflects the latest emission year in the current CDIAC data set; as new years are added to the CDIAC data set, the uncertainty map time series can also be extended.",

            "abstract": "Transient bright features, popularly referred to as Titan’s Magic Island, were observed in Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the northern sea, Ligeia Mare, in July 2013 (Hofgartner et al., 2014, Nature Geosci. 7, 493). Images obtained prior and subsequent to the July 2013 detection do not include these bright features. The features are not consistent with ambiguities, scalloping, gain control or edge effects and are not considered to be standard SAR image artifacts. We compared the measured radar cross-sections from the region of the anomalies to a suite of quasi-specular plus diffuse backscatter models and found that this class of models for a permanent structure can be ruled out to 88% confidence. Thus we conclude that the appearance of the features is the result of a transformation and the subsequent non-detections indicate that they were transient. The observational constraints do not permit tides and/or sea level change to be the dominant cause of the transient expression. We suggest that ephemeral phenomena such as surface waves, rising bubbles, and suspended or floating solids best explain these features. Local meteorology could stimulate or enhance these phenomena, but we are unable to constrain its role in the appearance of these transients. These enigmatic features and the waves reportedly detected in Punga Mare (Barnes et al., 2014, Planetary Science, accepted) are likely the first glimpses of dynamic processes that are commencing in the northern lakes and seas as summer nears in the northern hemisphere. It is plausible that they are an expression of the changing seasons and as Titan’s northern hemisphere continues transitioning toward summer they may occur with increased frequency. Ligeia Mare, including the region of the transients, will be observed again during the Cassini Titan flyby on August 21, 2014 and this observation could be diagnostic of the nature of these features. For example, if the transients are waves and waves are detectable at the 12 degrees incidence of the upcoming radar measurements, the predicted increase in wind speeds should result in a higher spatial density of these features.",

            "abstract": "The Guatemala Suture Zone is the fault-bound region in central Guatemala that contains the present North American–Caribbean plate boundary. This major composite geotectonic unit contains a variety of ophiolites, serpentinite mélanges, and metavolcano-sedimentary sequences along with high-grade schists, gneisses, low-grade metasediments and metagranites thrusted north and south of the active Motagua fault system (MFS). The North Motagua Mélange (NMM) outcrops north of the MFS and testifies the emplacement of exhumed subduction assemblages along a collisional tectonic setting. The NMM is composed of a serpentinite-matrix mélange that contains blocks of metabasites (subgreenschist facies metabasalt, grt-blueschist, eclogite, grt-amphibolite), vein-related rocks (jadeitite, omphacitite, albitite, mica-rock), and metatrondhjemites.\nOur new detailed petrographic and thermobarometric study on the garnet-bearing metabasites reveals a complex polymetamorphic history with multiple tectonic events. Eclogites show a classical clockwise PT path composed of (a) prograde blueschist/eclogite facies within garnet cores, (b) eclogite facies metamorphic peak at ~1.7 GPa and 620°C, (c) post-peak blueschist facies, (d) amphibolite facies overprint, and (e) late stage greenschist facies. Two types of garnet amphibolite blocks can be found, the first consist of (a) a relict eclogite facies peak at ~1.3 GPa and 550°C only preserved within anhedral garnet cores, and (b) surrounded by a post-peak amphibolite facies. In contrast, the second type displays a prograde amphibolite facies at 0.6-1.1 GPa and 400-650°C.\nThe eclogites metamorphic peak suggests formation in a normal subduction zone at ~60 km depth, a subsequent exhumation to the middle section of the subduction channel (~35 km), and a later metamorphic reworking at lower P and higher T before its final exhumation. The first type of garnet amphibolite shows a similar trajectory as the eclogites but at warmer conditions. In contrast, the second type of garnet amphibolite recorded a single prograde evolution along a hotter thermal gradient. These different PT paths suggest multiple metamorphic events that may be related to subduction initiation, partial exhumation and storage of HP–LT rocks, subduction of buoyant crust, final exhumation and obduction.",

            "abstract": "If science is for everyone, then it needs to be taught in environments that are welcoming to people who may not feel at home in a traditional classroom. A team of scientists and educators at the American Museum of Natural History have developed a new course, Our Earth’s Future, which prepares participants to contribute intelligently and fluently to informal “cocktail party” conversations about climate and climate change. The course, taught after hours at the museum, culminates in an actual cocktail party in one of the museum's halls where participants can practice their skills. Participants’ knowledge of climate change and attitudes towards climate change were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed before and after the two five-week course sessions.\nClimate literacy can also be included in existing events that are not obviously science-focused. Venues such as festivals, galleries, and underground art parties may be willing to broaden their definition of culture to include science - but only if they are asked. Given the increase in public discourse around the topic of climate change, there is an opportunity to reach people who wouldn’t attend a formal science lecture, but might attend a film screening or a fundraiser that had some scientific content. Qualitative audience assessments done after the annual “Mermaid Lagoon,” a fundraiser for ocean related causes that includes a scientific segment along with dance and theatrical performances, show increased enthusiasm and support for climate science when it is presented in a relevant, fun, and non-intimidating manner.",

            "abstract": "One way humans affect the Earth is by clearing lands and building cities, a process intricately coupled with population growth. The transformation of terrestrial environments by urbanization has been accelerating during the past 30 years. China, for instance, has experienced urbanization at an unprecedented rate, with the urban population increasing from ~20% to 50% between 1980 and 2010. This urban expansion has resulted in a range of environmental and socioeconomic consequences, such as released carbon, reduced habitats, and threatened biodiversity. Improved information on historical and future urbanization is essential to understand these environmental effects, and to promote a sustainable urbanization in China. Supported by urban maps derived from nightlights remote sensing data and socio-economic drivers, we developed an integrated modeling framework to project future urban expansion in China by integrating a top-down macro-scale statistical model with a bottom-up urban growth model (three examples in Figure 1). With the models calibrated and validated using historical data, we explored annual urban growth at the province level and urban sprawl at the grid level (1-km) over the next two decades under a number of socio-economic scenarios. The results of this study will be of great value with practical implications for a sustainable urbanization (e.g. mitigation of urban heat island).",

            "abstract": "One of the most important uncertainties in climate change is the positive feedback mechanism associated with the melting Arctic. As the Arctic permafrost destabilizes, labile carbon stored in the permafrost is subject to respiration and methanogenesis, producing greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. Understanding the timing and rate of this release is paramount to our long-term understanding of the global climate structure, yet the remote location of the North Slope logistically precludes widespread tower measurements, necessitating airborne measurements. Presented are 12C and 13C CO2 concentration flux measurements taken via an aircraft at a height of 10-30m during mid to late August 2013 from the north slope of Alaska. The data show different regimes for CO2 vs δ-13C over regions within a roughly 100km box, indicating heterogenous landscape with differing dominant biological processes. The data are compared to CH4 measurements that were taken simultaneously, showing highly varying concentrations of CH4 with several different archetypical relationships to the total CO2 regimes. The relationship between CO2, δ-13C CO2, and CH4 concentrations provide further insight into the biological processes occurring in the melting Arctic permafrost. The data show that the dominant uptake and emission processes change by time of day and location. While the CO2 and isotopologue data alone indicates whether a region is dominant in respiration or photosynthesis, combining the data with CH4 measurements provides insight into the provenance of the CH4 as well as methanogenic biological pathways active on the North Slope, while mass balance between CH4, CO2 or δ-13C CO2 determines whether the methane signature is from methanogenesis, natural hydrocarbon seeps, or methane flaring. The data show few if any cases for which increases in methane concentrations are accompanied by a deviation in CO2 or δ-13C CO2 that would indicate incomplete methane flaring or natural seeps.",

            "abstract": "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a method that allows researchers to map elevations, analyze surface deformation and even detect ground water level changes. The InSAR phase measurements are wrapped between 0 and 2π and therefore have to be unwrapped to reveal the full scale of the observations. Even though there are algorithms for finding discrete irrotational fields among neighboring pixels in two-dimensions, a three dimensional unwrapping approach is important as it can constrain the solution of our data to a more robust and accurate state. We developed a 3-D unwrapping algorithm based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that is capable of simultaneously filtering, unwrapping and inverting multiple interferograms to obtain a DEM or deformation map. The method is based on a path-following algorithm that unwraps the dataset starting from a reference point and moves to the next-highest quality neighboring point. The EKF algorithm allows us to better resolve unwrapping problems, especially in vegetated areas, which tend to be decorrelated, and hence obtain more accurate results.\nIn this study we apply our 3-D EKF unwrapping algorithm to North Anatolian and San Andreas fault zones in order to detect interseismic crustal movement across these two major fault systems. For the North Anatolian Fault we processed 37 Envisat scenes that covers the Ismetpasa segment of the fault, and generated 237 interferograms. The generated interferograms are used with both EKF and SBAS algorithms to estimate the deformation in the area. Our previous study of this segment based on the SBAS technique revealed that the Ismetpasa segment creeps at a rate of 8 mm/yr. For the San Andreas Fault (SAF) we processed 37 descending Envisat ASAR scenes acquired between November 2005 and October 2010. Our area of interest includes the central SAF near its intersection with the Garlock Fault. Initial results show deformation across the fault but the results have low fit to the data and further work is needed. In this presentation, we will also present the results from the SAF using SBAS and EKF.",

            "abstract": "The amount and timing of water release from snowpack sets the potential and pace for human and ecological systems residing in or near snowy topography. Warming will likely increase the snowline elevation and reduce the amount of the landscape that develops a significant snowpack. Because mountain catchments are topographically complex, understanding their sensitivity to warming and snowpack loss remains challenging. Previous research indicates that elevation is a dominant control on broad-scale snow accumulation. Thus, at the intermediate watershed scale (50 km2 < drainage area < 500 km2), a catchment’s elevation distribution should be a robust predictor of its susceptibility to snowpack loss. We present a simple framework that captures the climate and elevation-based sensitivity of mountain catchments to warming-driven snowpack loss. Framework development is based on the characterization of ~3,200 watershed elevation distributions in the northern Rocky Mountains, U.S. and is coupled with estimates of increase in snow water equivalent (SWE) with elevation for a variety of climatic types. Potential catchment-wide snowpack loss is modeled across a range of warming scenarios using a hypsometric approach and a sigmoidal function that can be easily adjusted to reflect warming-based alterations in how SWE increases with elevation. Monte Carlo simulations and regression analyses for 20,000 synthetic elevation distributions suggest that location, scale, and shape parameters that quantify distribution characteristics can be used to model SWE loss. Our model shows that similar amounts and patterns of SWE loss can occur even when catchments are centered in different elevation bands, suggesting that simple multi-parameter estimates of sensitivity may prove useful. We identify critical thresholds where different elevation distribution types exhibit unique responses to warming and discuss possible implications for mountain forests and carbon and nitrogen cycling.",

            "abstract": "Hypersaline laminated cyanobacterial mats are excellent model systems for investigating photoautotrophic contributions to biogeochemical cycling on a millimeter scale. These self-sustaining ecosystems are characterized by steep physiochemical gradients that fluctuate dramatically on hour timescales, providing a dynamic environment to study microbial response. However, elucidating the distribution of energy from light absorption into biomass requires a complete understanding of the various constituents of the mat. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which can be composed of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and DNA are a major component of these mats and may function in the redistribution of nutrients and metabolites within the community. To test this notion, we established a model mat-building culture for comparison with the phylogenetically diverse natural mat communities. In these two systems we determined how proteins and glycans in the matrix changed as a function of light and tracked nutrient flow from the matrix. Using mass spectrometry metaproteomics analysis, we found homologous proteins in both field and culture extracellular matrix that point to cyanobacterial turnover of amino acids, inorganic nutrients, carbohydrates and nucleic acids from the EPS. Other abundant functions identified included oxidative stress response from both the cyanobacteria and heterotrophs and cyanobacterial structural proteins that may play a role in mat cohesion. Several degradative enzymes also varied in abundance in the EPS in response to light availability, suggesting active secretion. To further test cyanobacterial EPS turnover, we generated isotopically-labeled EPS and used NanoSIMS to trace uptake of this labeled EPS. Our findings suggest Cyanobacteria may facilitate nutrient transfer to other groups, as well as uptake of their own products through degradation of EPS components. This work provides evidence for the essential roles of EPS for storage, structural cohesion and protection, with active light-dependent turnover by both Cyanobacteria and the heterotrophic community.",

            "abstract": "Olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) is the main cause for the seismic anisotropy observed in the upper mantle. Numerical models of texture evolution are frequently used to interpret seismic anisotropy or to predict the seismic anisotropy generated by a particular pattern of mantle flow. However, the relationship between mantle flow and seismic anisotropy is non-trivial in regions with complex deformation kinematics, for example along subduction-zones and mid-oceanic ridges. Here we examine the effect of deformation history on the process of texture and seismic anisotropy development from both experiments and numerical models.\nSamples from the Åheim dunite, which has a relatively strong pre-existing CPO, were deformed in axial compression using a Griggs apparatus at T = 1200°C, P ~1 GPa. Three different sample orientations were investigated, with the compression axis perpendicular, oblique, or parallel to the foliation plane. Olivine preferred orientation was determined by EBSD and quantified using three elements of texture: strength, symmetry, and orientation. We have found that that the evolution of olivine CPO depends strongly on the initial sample orientation. In addition, none of these experiments show the development of a clear steady-state texture and mechanical behavior.\nThe experimental results are compared to numerical models of texture development using the viscoplastic self consistent approach (VPSC). In these models we used the initial texture measured from the Åheim dunite rotated into three different orientations, to reproduce the starting conditions of the laboratory experiments. We find some similarities between the model and the experiments, although there are subtle and important differences. Future modeling work will attempt to define a set of parameters that allow numerical models of texture evolution to reproduce more precisely experimental results.",

            "abstract": "The AmeriFlux network collects long-term carbon, water and energy flux measurements obtained with the eddy covariance method. In order to attribute fluxes to specific areas of the land surface, flux source calculations are essential. Consequently, footprint models can support flux up-scaling exercises to larger regions, often based on remote sensing data. However, flux footprints are not currently being routinely calculated; different approaches exist but have not been standardized. In part, this is due to varying instrumentation and data processing methods at the site level. The goal of this work is to map tower footprints for a future standardized AmeriFlux product to be generated at the network level.\nThese footprints can be estimated by analytical models, Lagrangian simulations, and large-eddy simulations. However, for many sites, the datasets currently submitted to central databases generally do not include all variables required. The AmeriFlux network is moving to collection of raw data and expansion of the variables requested from sites, giving the possibility to calculate all parameters and variables needed to run most of the available footprint models. In this pilot study, we are applying state of the art footprint models across a subset of AmeriFlux sites, to evaluate the feasibility and merit of developing standardized footprint results.\nIn addition to comparing outcomes from several footprint models, we will attempt to verify and validate the results in two ways: (i) Verification of our footprint calculations at sites where footprints have been experimentally estimated. (ii) Validation at towers situated in heterogeneous landscapes: here, variations in the observed fluxes are expected to correlate with spatiotemporal variations of the source area composition. Once implemented, the footprint results can be used as additional information within the AmeriFlux database that can support data interpretation and data assimilation. Lastly, we will explore the expandability of this approach to other flux networks by collaborating with and including sites from the ICOS and NEON networks in our analyses. This can enable utilizing the footprint model output to improve network interoperability, thus further promoting synthesis analyses and understanding of system-level questions in the future.",

            "abstract": "Integrated assessment models project the future electricity generation mix under different policy, technology, and socioeconomic scenarios, but they do not directly address site-specific factors such as interconnection costs, population density, land use restrictions, air quality, NIMBY concerns, or water availability that might affect the feasibility of achieving the technology mix. Moreover, since these factors can change over time due to climate, policy, socioeconomics, and so on, it is important to examine the dynamic feasibility of integrated assessment scenarios “on the ground.” This paper explores insights from coupling an integrated assessment model (GCAM-USA) with a geospatial power plant siting model (the Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility model, CERF) within a larger multi-model framework that includes regional climate, hydrologic, and water management modeling. GCAM-USA is a dynamic-recursive market equilibrium model simulating the impact of carbon policies on global and national markets for energy commodities and other goods; one of its outputs is the electricity generation mix and expansion at the state-level. It also simulates water demands from all sectors that are downscaled as input to the water management modeling. CERF simulates siting decisions by dynamically representing suitable areas for different generation technologies with geospatial analyses (informed by technology-specific siting criteria, such as required mean streamflow per the Clean Water Act), and then choosing siting locations to minimize interconnection costs (to electric transmission and gas pipelines). CERF results are compared across three scenarios simulated by GCAM-USA: 1) a non-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) in which conventional fossil-fueled technologies prevail, 2) a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) in which the carbon price causes a shift toward nuclear, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and renewables, and 3) a repeat of scenario (2) in which CCS technologies are made unavailable—resulting in a large increase in the nuclear fraction of the mix.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric chemistry models must include a large number of processes to accurately describe the temporal and spatial behavior of atmospheric composition. They require a wide range of chemical and physical data (parameters) that describe elementary gas-phase and heterogeneous processes. The review and evaluation of chemical and physical data has, therefore, played an important role in the development of chemical models and in their use in environmental assessment activities. The NASA data panel was originally established in 1977 by the NASA Upper Atmosphere Research Program Office to provide a critical evaluation of kinetic and photochemical data for use in laboratory studies and in atmospheric modeling of stratospheric ozone. Today, the NASA data panel evaluations have a broader atmospheric focus and include Ox, O(1D), singlet O2, HOx, NOx, Organic, FOx, ClOx, BrOx, IOx, SOx, and Na reactions, three-body reactions, equilibrium constants, photochemistry, aqueous chemistry, heterogeneous chemistry and processes, and thermodynamic parameters. The 2011 evaluation (JPL 10-6 available at\nhttp://jpldataeval.jpl.nasa.gov.\n) includes the comprehensive coverage of ~670 bimolecular reactions, 75 three-body reactions, 24 equilibrium constants, 215 photochemical species, 355 aqueous and heterogeneous processes, thermodynamic parameters for 590 species, and over 4000 literature citations. Each evaluation includes (1) recommended values (e.g. rate coefficients, absorption cross sections, and uptake coefficients) with estimated uncertainty factors and (2) a note describing the available experimental and theoretical data and explanation for the recommendation. As new studies have become available over the years the recommendations are critically reviewed and updated as warranted (the next evaluation is scheduled for release in early 2015).\nThis presentation provides an overview of the NASA data panel evaluation process and the methodology used to estimate uncertainties. Examples on the current use of a 2-D model to help set evaluation priorities will be illustrated. Evaluation users are encouraged to discuss/suggest potential improvements in analysis and the communication of the evaluation results to the modeling community.",

            "abstract": "Since the late 1960s, temperature profile data have been collected every 10-12 days at Lake Tahoe, USA. Past analyses have shown an overall warming of the lake at all depths, attributable to measured climate warming. The annual average, volume-weighted lake water temperature of the upper 400 m has increased at a rate of 0.011 deg. C/year since 1969 – 2014. There has been a concurrent evolution in the nature of the thermal stratification. While the maximum value of lake stability has not increased in the last 45 years, the length of time the lake remains stratified has been increased by 22 days, mostly occurring as a result of an earlier onset of spring stratification Using statistically downscaled GCM outputs for two different carbon emission scenarios, 1-D numerical simulations of the lake thermal structure over a 100-year period were performed. The results suggest a continuation and intensification of the already observed trends. Depending on the carbon emission scenario assumed, the length of the stratified season will increase by between 65 and 52 days by 2098 over the 1968 value. Most of the future increase will take place at the end of the season with a delay in the onset of winter. The observed impacts of stratification change on past ecosystem and water quality conditions will be presented, and possible future changes will be discussed. Plausible future states could range from climatic eutrophication to climatic oligotrophication.",

Because participants make the voicemails themselves, FutureCoast opens up creative ways for people to think about possibly climate-changed futures and personal ways to talk about them. FutureCoast is a project of the\nPoLAR Partnership\nwith a target audience of informal adult learners primarily reached via mobile devices and online platforms.\nScientists increasingly use scenarios and storylines as ways to explore the implications of environmental change and societal choices. Stories help people make connections across experiences and disciplines and link large-scale events to personal consequences. By making the future seem real today, FutureCoast’s framework helps people visualize and plan for future climate changes.\nThe voicemails contributed to FutureCoast are spread through the game’s intended timeframe (2020 through 2065). Based on initial content analysis of voicemail text, common themes include ecosystems and landscapes, weather, technology, societal issues, governance and policy. Other issues somewhat less frequently discussed include security, food, industry and business, health, energy, infrastructure, water, economy, and migration. Further voicemail analysis is examining: temporal dimensions (salient time frames, short vs. long term issues, intergenerational, etc.), content (adaptation vs. mitigation, challenges vs. opportunities, etc.), and emotion (hopeful, resigned, etc. and overall emotional context).\nFutureCoast also engaged audiences through facilitated in-person experiences, geocaching events, and social media (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube). Analysis of the project suggests story-based games such as FutureCoast can serve as effective, accessible tools for engaging diverse audiences in thinking and talking about future “what if?” scenarios related to climate change and its impacts.",

Remote sensing technologies are beginning to monitor CO2 and CH4 from ground and space (OCO-2 and GOSAT) with solar spectroscopy enabling direct MRV. However, current ground based coverage is sparse due to the need for large and expensive high-resolution spectrometers that are part of the Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON, Bruker 125HR). This limits our MRV and satellite validation abilities, both regionally and globally. There are striking monitoring gaps in Asia, South America and Africa where the CO2 emissions are growing and there is a large uncertainty in fluxes from land use change, biomass burning and rainforest vulnerability. To fill this gap we evaluate the precision, accuracy and stability of our new compact, affordable and easy to use low-resolution spectrometer (Bruker EM27SUN) by comparing it with the much larger high-resolution TCCON instruments for column CO2, CH4, H2O and HOD. Results from Four Corners, Los Alamos, Caltech and Dryden-Armstrong sites show that our EM27SUN captures the variability of the aforementioned constituents very well, but has low and high offsets for CO2 and CH4, respectively. These off-the-shelf spectrometers should dramatically expand the coverage of regional column CO2 and CH4 observations, particularly in gap regions that include the rainforest. We will present opportunities that we are exploring to help enable transparent and reliable MRV and measurement of the coupled water-carbon cycle in tropical ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Accurately quantifying precipitation in both space and time is a central challenge in hydrologic modelling. Data products from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) are commonly used as precipitation forcings in many models. TRMM provides 3-hr precipitation estimates at a near-global scale (-50◦ S to 50◦N) with a 0.25 degree spatial resolution. However, when applied in regional scale hydrologic models, the spatial resolution of the TRMM is often too coarse limiting our ability to simulate relevant hydrologic processes.This study focuses on addressing the science question: can we improve the spatial resolution of the TRMM using statistical downscaling with environmental variables derived from finer scale remote sensing data? The goal is to downscale the TRMM resolution from 0.25 degrees (25 km) to 0.05 degrees (about 5 km). In our approach, we first identify environmental variables (i.e., vegetation cover, topography, and temperature) that are related to the formation of or result from precipitation by exploring their statistical relationships with TRMM precipitation at varying temporal scales (i.e., daily, monthly, and yearly) using an analysis of variance in multiple regression. The MODIS vegetation index, MODIS leaf area index, and SPOT vegetation are examined as a proxy for vegetation. To represent the topography, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) is used. MODIS land surface temperature are used for temperature. Second, we characterize a residual component, which cannot be explained by the statistical relationship between precipitation and environmental variables, to improve the accuracy of the downscaling results. For example, recent studies have shown that approximately 30-40% of the variability in annual precipitation cannot be explained by vegetation and elevation characteristics. According for this unexplained variability in statistical downscaling methods is a significant challenge. Here, we use a data assimilation technique to interpolate the residual component and generate the downscaled precipitation. Results are presented for the Ohio River Basin. The final downscaled TRMM is evaluated by comparing with the National Center for Environmental Predication (NCEP) Stage VI precipitation and rainfall gauge data.",

            "abstract": "In laboratory tests of oscillating-water-column (OWC) devices for extracting wave energy from ocean waves, an orifice is often used as the power-takeoff mechanism. Calculations of the energy loss due to vortex shedding and the pneumatic extraction efficiency of the OWC chamber are two challenging issues. Direct measurement of the energy loss due to vortex shedding is difficult. The pneumatic extraction efficiency is often calculated by using a one-point measurement method, in which one pressure senor is used to measure the air pressure variation and one wave gauge is used to measure the instantaneous surface displacement inside the OWC chamber. This method is simple, but a systematic error may be introduced, especially for shorter waves. Based on our recent laboratory and theoretical studies of a pile-supported OWC device, we present a method for estimating the energy loss due to vortex shedding and improving the accuracy in the calculation of pneumatic extraction efficiency using one-point method. The method in this study is designed for an OWC device whose chamber has a circular cross section, but can be extended to other cases where development of an analytical theory is possible.",

            "abstract": "Land cover changes associated with both human activities and global change processes (such as drought, fire and invasive species) can lead to changes in byophisical processes that support hydrological processes in watersheds, leading to potential changes in longterm streamflow regimes. Traditional hydrological approaches have successfully associated stremaflow regimes to watershed physical attributes such as area via hydrological scaling. Yet, such approaches preclude the incorporation of biophysical processes, such as land cover changes, into the statistics of streamflow and scaling approaches. In this work, we test the hypothesis that mean and extreme riverflows in a watershed should scale not only with surface area, but also with leaf area. To test this hypothesis, we use a dataset consisiting of daily stremflow observations for 87 sub-basins of the Amazon basin, covering a range of watershed sizes from 1,617 km2 to 4,680,000 km2. We developed scaling relations of the type E[Qr]= aAb or E[Qr]= c(LA)d between the order r statistical moments of the probability distribution functions of mean and extreme riverflows (E[Qr]) and both the watershed area (A) and the leaf area (LA) - which we define as ecohydrological scaling. Our results show that our proposed ecohydrological scaling represents the statistics of streamflow as well as traditional hydrological scaling relationships. However, ecohydrological scaling allows the assessment of the effects of land use-land cover changes on hydrological regimes. We used previously developed scenarios of Amazon deforestation to assess these effects and found maximum reductions of the order of 35% in the longterm mean and extreme riverflows as a result of deforestation. The approach that we propose uses the simplicity of hydrological scaling and improves it by incorporating ecohydrological processes into physical scaling. We illustrate its potential by applying it to future vegetation cover scenarios but highlight how, when combined with more sophisticated ecosystem and atmospheric models, ecohydrological scaling can become a powerful predictive tool. In summary, we present a new, ecohydrological scaling approach that combines biological and hydrological scaling approaches to assess the regional effects of global-change type processes.",

            "abstract": "Artisanal miners in the Peruvian Amazon, especially in the Madre de Dios region, are targeting fluvial deposits along riverbanks as part of a modern-day gold rush. These miners often use mercury, causing Hg pollution and ecological damage. Research on the environmental consequences of these mines has focused primarily on the fate of Hg, and to date little work has considered whether mining river sediments affects the release and cycling of other trace metals. This project measures trace metal concentrations in soil and vegetation samples developed on fluvial sediments at one mine site and two non-mine (control) sites across gradients in natural plant succession and riverbank composition. Some metals, including Pb and Mo, showed leachable metal concentrations (determined using EPA Method 2050B and ICP-MS analysis) that were lower in mine site soils than control site soils, but higher in mine site vegetation than control site vegetation. These results held across all gradients in natural plant succession and soil composition. This suggests that metals may be preferentially mobilized from the soil and taken up by surrounding vegetation as a result of mining activities. Soils were also treated with a sequential leach to separate metals that are exchangeable, bound to carbonates, bound to Fe and Mn oxides, bound to organic matter and in the residual phase. Initial data shows that trace metal concentrations are generally lower in all phases from mine soils vs. control soils, across all gradients in natural plant succession and soil composition. Trace metal mobilization due to mining is facilitated by changing pH or redox conditions – e.g., by exposing buried minerals to water and oxygen. Fluvial sediments at these studied sites were already exposed during their erosion and transport, but anoxic conditions following deposition may allow a build-up of metals that are mobilized once sediments are re-worked by mining. It is also possible that Hg affects the mobility of other metals, like through almagation and/or changing acidity, since Hg acts as a Bronsted-Lowry acid when speciated in water. The results of this study indicate that Hg-intensive fluvial gold mining may facilitate trace metal pollution and hopes to inspire further research into the mechanisms and consequences behind illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Transient rip currents on alongshore uniform beaches develop from the coalescence of surf zone eddies, exchanging tracers between the surf zone and the potentially stratified inner shelf. The interaction of stratification and transient rip currents has not yet been investigated. Surf zone eddies responsible for transient rip currents are generated by short-crested wave breaking, a process included in wave-resolving (WR) Boussinesq models. However, WR models are depth-integrated and cannot account for stratification and vertically sheared flows. Wave-averaged (WA) models can simulate these processes, but cannot create surf zone eddies. A combination of WR and WA models is required to accurately simulate surf zone-inner shelf exchange.\nHere, WR depth-integrated Boussinessq model funwaveC is coupled to the stratification and depth-resolving WA Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system. The surf zone eddy generation forcing is extracted from a funwaveC simulation of normally incident waves on a planar beach, and provided to COAWST as a depth-uniform surf zone force. COAWST model simulations resolving the surf zone to mid-shelf are conducted with surf zone eddy forcing, idealistic surface heating/cooling, stratification, and Coriolis effects. These simulations provide three-dimensional evolution of velocity and temperature, diagnosed to quantify the role of surf zone eddy forcing in surf zone-inner shelf exchange. The impact of stratification on rip currents and exchange is studied by varying the stratification. Funded by the Office of Naval Research.",

            "abstract": "Examining the temporal and spatial relationship between basaltic volcanism and extensional faulting can help delineate the influence of faulting on the location of source vents and distribution of subsequent lava flows. Young extensional environments offer a unique opportunity to resolve the interdependence of faulting and volcanism as faults have not yet been buried and precise ages can be acquired on volcanic rocks. The Larkspur Hills, located along the northwestern margin of the Basin and Range in northeastern California preserve flow-on-flow basalt sequences exposed in the footwalls of numerous normal faults. The eruption of these 3 to 8 Ma flows was coeval with the development and progression of extensional faulting, but the detailed relationship was not clear. Although several flows have previously been dated using 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, individual flows cannot easily be identified in outcrop or geochemically. Paleomagnetic analyses have allowed us to differentiate individual flows possessing unique remanence directions, and to correlate flow sequences. Nearly 1,300 paleomagnetic core samples from 167 flows were collected within the Larkspur Hills. Generalized magnetostratigraphy and detailed remanent magnetic directions were analyzed in conjunction with the existing geochronology to correlate flows and constrain the relative timing of faulting and volcanism. Results indicate that volcanic activity occurred during four distinct episodes between 3 to 8 Ma, and suggest that contemporaneous faulting likely influenced the distribution of subsequent flows by producing topographic barriers or pathways to the flows. In addition, when compared to the expected reference direction for stable North America, the paleomagnetic data indicate that the region has undergone 11.9 ± 4.5˚ of clockwise rotation. This result agrees favorably with studies that have inferred appreciable rotation of our study area associated with clockwise rotation of the Oregon coastal block.",

All lesson plans designed and taught by the graduate Fellows must include one or more connections to their research, and these connections must be demonstrated to the students during the lessons. International research partnerships with Australia, the Bahamas, England, and Poland provide valuable opportunities for graduate Fellows to conduct field work abroad and allow our partner teachers to have authentic research experiences that they can bring back to their classrooms. Program effectiveness has been examined using pre- and post-year attitudinal surveys, formal lesson plan documents, Fellow and teacher journals, focus group meetings with a project evaluator, and direct observation of Fellow-led classroom activities. Analyses of data gathered during the past four years of the partnership will be presented that examine the diversity in approaches taken by Fellows to communicate big ideas, changes in the ability of Fellows to find connections between their research and classroom lessons while keeping them aligned with state and national standards, and the quality of the mentorship provided to the Fellows by our partner teachers.

Second, we continue to upgrade and host digital compendia that summarize and highlight published findings on the samples (e.g., lunar samples, meteorites from Mars). We host high resolution imagery of samples as it becomes available, including newly scanned images of historical prints from the Apollo missions. Finally we are creating plans to collect and provide new data, including 3D imagery, point cloud data, micro CT data, and external links to other data sets on selected samples. Together, these individual efforts will provide unprecedented digital access to NASA’s Astromaterials, enabling preservation of the samples through more specific and targeted requests, and supporting new planetary science research and collaborations on the samples.",

            "abstract": "The plasma thermodynamics in the solar upper atmosphere, particularly in the corona, are dominated by the magnetic field, which controls the flow and dissipation of energy. The relative lack of knowledge of the coronal vector magnetic field is a major handicap for the progress in coronal physics. This makes the development of measurement methods of coronal magnetic fields a high priority in solar physics. The Hanle effect in the UV and IR spectral lines is a largely unexplored diagnostic. Here we use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study the magnitude of the signal to be expected for typical coronal magnetic fields for selected spectral lines in the UV and IR wavelength ranges, namely the H I Lyman series (i.e., α, β, and γ), O VI 103.2 nm line, and the He I 1083 nm line. We show that the selected lines may be useful for the diagnostic of coronal magnetic fields. We also show that the combination of polarization measurements of spectral lines with different sensitivities to the Hanle effect may be most appropriate for the interpretation of the data. We propose that UV coronal magnetic field mapper should be a central part of the science payload of any future spacebased solar observatory.",

The magnetopause standoff position prediction and response time to the solar wind changes will then be compared to results from available empirical models (e.g. Shue et al. 1997), and to Cluster and the Geotail missions magnetopause crossing observations. Rigorous analysis/comparison of observations and empirical models is critical in determining magnetosphere dynamics for model validation. We will identify solar wind conditions that affect the model predictions significantly and lead to differences between the models.

In watersheds featuring deep groundwater and a low conductivity layer laying under permeable topsoil, interflow contributing areas expand and shrink based on the thickness of the perched layer, the topographic slope, and the ratio of hydraulic conductivity of topsoil to that of the impending layer. In this work, we present the development and application of two dynamic interflow models that implemented a mobile boundary condition to track flow from each of contributing cells starting from the edge of stream reaches extending upslope and constrained by downslope travel distance. Both analytical models are based on Boussinesq assumptions with percolation while one is continuous and the other is event-based. The continuous interflow model incorporates a two layer soil moisture accounting water balance analysis, pedotransfer function, percolation, and evaporation routines. The event rain based analytical solution generates interflow time series based on dynamically updated distribution function of downslope travel distances of contributing cells. We applied both modeling approaches in an intensively instrumented headwater basin in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Both models showed good agreement with observed perched water depth, interflow discharge and soil moisture observations from 110m long open interflow interception trench whose 5.6 hectares of contributing hillslope were fitted with nested piezometers, soil moisture sensors, and series of V-notch weir boxes.",

We review the traditional attachment efficiency approaches, which are based on packed column experiments and mean field parameters that define the colloid-collector interactions, and contrast them with a discrete heterogeneity approach. This new correlation equation was developed to capture prediction from a trajectory model that quantitatively explains directly observed colloid retention in an impinging jet system under unfavorable conditions via incorporation of discrete zones of attraction (nanoscale heterodomains). In order compare of observed and simulated retention in the impinging jet with granular porous media, we developed a linkage between the jet and Happel sphere unit-cell geometries. We demonstrate that attachment efficiency can be mechanistically explained by near surface trajectory analysis and well represented by three terms: 1) Maxwell distribution of colloids in the near surface fluid domain, 2) Spacing and size distribution of heterodomains on the collector relative to colloid size, and 3) Torque and force balance of the colloid in contact with heterodomains. These results indicate that a traditional empirical approach can be improved to a theoretical framework that, from basic principles, is able to predict colloid retention under unfavorable conditions.",

            "abstract": "Biological productivity in many ocean regions is controlled by the availability of the nutrient phosphorus (P), including the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Aerosol deposition is a key source of P in the Mediterranean. Understanding the composition of this P is critical for determining its solubility and therefore potential bioavailability. We investigated aerosol P composition in European and North African air masses, the main sources of aerosol deposition to the Mediterranean Sea, using Phosphorus Near Edge X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (P-NEXFS). We show that European aerosols are a significant source of soluble P to the Mediterranean Sea. The traditionally studied North African sourced air masses carry more total P to the Mediterranean Sea than European sourced air masses and contain mostly apatite, a largely insoluble calcium phosphate mineral. However, European aerosols deliver P that is on average 3.5 times more soluble than North African aerosols and furthermore are dominated by organic P compounds. The increased solubility of European aerosols leads to comparable amounts of soluble P by mass delivered to the Mediterranean Sea by both air masses. The ultimate origin of organic P does not stem from common primary emission sources, such as coal fly ash and diesel emissions. Rather, P associated with bacteria best explains the presence of organic P in Mediterranean aerosols. The soluble organic nature of the P in European sourced air masses underscores the need to examine aerosols from this region as a source of P to the Mediterranean Sea. This study also demonstrates that synchrotron-based techniques are effective tools for characterizing aerosols and gaining new insights.",

            "abstract": "Particle-based numerical simulations allow detailed investigations of small-scale processes and mechanisms associated with fault initiation and slip, which emerge naturally in such models. This study investigates the evolving mechanical conditions and associated micro-mechanisms during transient slip on a weak decollement propagating beneath a growing contractional wedge (e.g., accretionary prism, fold and thrust belt). The models serve as analogs of the seismic cycle, although lacking full earthquake dynamics. Nonetheless, the mechanical evolution of both decollement and upper plate can be monitored, and correlated with the particle-scale physical and contact properties, providing insights into changes that accompany such stick-slip behavior. In this study, particle assemblages consolidated under gravity and bonded to impart cohesion, are pushed at a constant velocity above a weak, unbonded decollement surface. Forward propagation of decollement slip occurs in discrete pulses, modulated by heterogeneous stress conditions (e.g., roughness, contact bridging) along the fault. Passage of decollement slip resets the stress along this horizon, producing distinct patterns: shear stress is enhanced in front of the slipped decollement due to local contact bridging and fault locking; shear stress minima occur immediately above the tip, denoting local stress release and contact reorganization following slip; more mature portions of the fault exhibit intermediate shear stress, reflecting more stable contact force distributions and magnitudes. This pattern of shear stress pre-conditions the decollement for future slip events, which must overcome the high stresses at the fault tip. Long-term slip along the basal decollement induces upper plate contraction. When upper plate stresses reach critical strength conditions, new thrust faults break through the upper plate, relieving stresses and accommodating horizontal shortening. Decollement activity retreats back to the newly formed thrust fault. The cessation of upper plate fault slip causes gradual increases in upper plate stresses, rebuilding shear stresses along the decollement and enabling renewed pulses of decollement slip. Thus, upper plate deformation occurs out of phase with decollement propagation.",

            "abstract": "Much of Equatorial Asia is currently undergoing extensive burning from agricultural fires and rapid land-use conversion to oil palm plantations, with substantial consequences for air quality and health. In June 2013, Singapore experienced severe smoke levels, with surface particulate matter concentrations greater than ten times average. Unlike past haze events in Singapore (e.g. September 1997 and October 2006), the June 2013 pollution event occurred during El Nino-neutral conditions. Using a combination of observations and chemical transport modeling, we examine relationships between sea surface temperatures, wind fields, fire patterns, and aerosol optical depth during the June 2013 haze event. We find reasonable agreement between satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the MODIS and MISR instruments and in-situ measurements from the AERONET stations across Equatorial Asia for 2005-2010 (MODIS R2 = 0.39, bias = -1.6%; MISR R2 = 0.27, bias = -42%). However, AOD observations fail to capture the Singapore pollution event of June 2013. Simulations with the GEOS-Chem model suggest that anomalously high dust concentrations during June 2013 may have impaired the ability of MODIS to monitor the haze over Singapore. In contrast, we show that the OMI Aerosol Index can effectively capture these smoke events and may be used to monitor future haze episodes in Equatorial Asia. We find that the June 2013 haze in Singapore may be attributed to anomalously strong westerlies carrying smoke from Riau Province in Indonesia. These westerlies, 5 m s-1 faster than the 2005-2010 mean June winds, are consistent with the phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) crossing the Maritime Continent at that time. These westerlies may have been further enhanced by a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), an east-west gradient in sea surface temperature anomalies across the Indian Ocean, with cold sea surface temperature anomalies (-3 C°) off the Arabian coast and warm anomalies (+2 C°) in the East. These conditions appear to provide an important meteorological pathway by which land-use change fires in Indonesia may affect the health of large populations. Our work suggests that this pathway should be taken into account in the development of strategies to curb fire-related air pollution and health effects in Indonesia.",

            "abstract": "The idea of reading and understanding scientific articles can be daunting to beginning geology students. A student driven question “How do I read a scientific paper?” became the catalyst for a 1-unit special topic course, specifically devoted to the process of reading scientific articles. Five students participated in the course, which focused on research articles pertaining to an upcoming field study in Death Valley. The course was divided into four main portions: locating articles, reading and understand scientific articles, applying of articles in the field, and creating an abstract. Articles were located electronically through the Palomar College library. The first step was to teach students how to navigate databases for the desired material. Part Two was the most challenging and time consuming: the process of reading, analyzing, and comprehending scholarly articles. What made the course interesting was the student driven approach to the articles. Under guidance of an instructor, students worked as a group, navigating two different articles while developing their own strategies to obtain the basic concepts of the article. Each student then had to analyze an additional two articles of their choosing. During this time observations were made on student confidence, methods developed to assist in understanding articles, student challenges and successes.\nInformation gained from the articles was then applied during a five day field course in Death Valley. Each student gave a brief presentation about the two articles read independently, applying them to various settings in the Death Valley region. Upon returning from the trip, students were tasked with contacting an author from one of the papers. The final portion of the special topic course was for students to produce their own abstracts, requiring them to condense a semester’s worth of work into a short amount of words. From this 1-unit course, students learned there is no one way to read a scientific article, and never is reading an article just once ever enough. It takes multiple readings and multiple analyses before a reader fully comprehends what the writer of the article is discussing. In conclusion this course gave students a foundation in understanding how to read scientific articles.",

            "abstract": "Arctic soils contain a large pool of terrestrial C and are of great interest because of their potential for releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Few attempts have been made, however, to derive quantitative budgets of CO2 and CH4 budgets for high-latitude ecosystems. Therefore, this study used naturally occurring geochemical and isotopic tracers to estimate production pathways and transformations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC = Σ (total) dissolved CO2) and dissolved CH4 in soil pore waters from 17 locations (drainages) in Barrow, Alaska (USA) in July and September, 2013; and to approximate a complete balance of belowground C cycling at our sampling locations. Results suggest that CH4 was primarily derived from biogenic acetate fermentation, with a shift at 4 locations from July to September towards CO2 reduction as the dominant methanogenic pathway. A large majority of CH4 produced at the frost table methane was transferred directly to the atmosphere via plant roots and ebullition (94.0 ± 1.4% and 96.6 ± 5.0% in July and September). A considerable fraction of the remaining CH4 was oxidized to CO2 during upward diffusion in July and September, respectively. Methane oxidization produced <1% of CO2 relative to alternative production mechanisms in deep subsurface pore waters. The majority of subsurface CO2 was produced from anaerobic respiration, likely due to reduction of Fe oxides and humics (52 ± 6 to 100 ± 13%, on average) while CO2 produced from methanogenesis accounted for the remainder (0 ± 13% to 47 ± 6%, on average) for July and September, respectively. Dissolved CH4 and dissolved CO2 concentrations correlated with thaw depth, suggesting that Arctic ecosystems will likely produce and release a greater amount of greenhouse gasses under projected warming and deepening of active layer thaw depth under future climate change scenarios.",

Water vapor plumes have been observed emanating from the southern hemispheres of Enceladus and Europa (Hansen et al. 2011, Roth et al. 2014), and N2plumes carrying ice and ark particles on Triton (Soderblom et al. 2009).\nThe gas and ice grain distributions in the Enceladus plume depend on the subsurface gas properties and the geometry of the fissures e.g., (Schmidt et al. 2008, Ingersoll et al. 2010). Of course the fissures can have complex geometries due to tidal stresses, melting, freezing etc., but directly sampled and inferred gas and grain properties for the plume (source rate, bulk velocity, terminal grain velocity) can be used to provide a basis to constrain characteristic dimensions of vent width and depth. We used a 2-dimensional Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique to model venting from both axi-symmetric canyons with widths ~2 km and narrow jets with widths ~15-40 m. For all of our vent geometries, considered the water vapor source rates (1027­ – 1028 s-1) and bulk gas velocities (~330 – 670 m/s) obtained at the surface were consistent with inferred values obtained by fits of the data for the plume densities (1026 – 1028 s-1, 250 – 1000 m/s) respectively. However, when using the resulting DSMC gas distribution for the canyon geometries to integrate the trajectories of ice grains we found it insufficient to accelerate submicron ice grains to Enceladus’ escape speed. On the other hand, the gas distributions in the jet like vents accelerated grains > 10 μm significantly above Enceladus’ escape speed. It has been suggested that micron-sized grains are ejected from the vents with speeds comparable to the Enceladus escape speed.\nHere we report on these results including comparisons to results obtained from 1D models as well as discuss the implications of our plume model results. We also show preliminary results for similar considerations applied to Europa.\n",

            "abstract": "Porphyry copper deposits commonly occur in arc-related settings where ore-metals are transported by magmas from the mantle wedge to shallow depths, and subsequently partition into the exsolving volatile phase. The partitioning of Cu between crystallizing silicate, oxide and sulfide minerals, sulfide melts and magmatic volatiles will determine the efficiency of Cu transfer into the magmatic-hydrothermal system. Understanding the Cu partitioning behavior between crystallizing mineral phases and silicate melt during crystallization fractionation is therefore fundamentally important. Among the crystallizing phases, amphibole is stable across a wide pressure (P) - temperature (T) range in hydrous arc magmas. Therefore, if the partition coefficients of Cu between amphibole and silicate melts are well constrained, the measured variation of Cu concentrations in natural amphibole crystals can be used to reconstruct the evolution of the Cu concentration in the silicate melt.\nIn this study, a series of experiments were conducted by piston cylinder apparatus over a wide range of melt compositions (andesitic to rhyolitic) to determine the amphibole/melt partition coefficient of Cu. The experiments were run at T = 740 - 990 °C, P = 0.7 GPa, and oxygen fugacity (fO2) between NNO +0.75 and NNO +2. The metal activities were imposed by using Au97Cu3 and Au92Cu8 alloy capsules. The apparent Cu solubilities in both the silicate melt and amphibole phases decrease with decreasing temperature. The Cu concentrations in a dacite melt increase approximately by factor of 3 while fO2 increases from NNO +0.75 to NNO +2. However, the amphibole/melt partition coefficient of Cu remains nearly constant at a value of 0.067 ± 0.013 (1 σ), indicating that the partitioning of Cu is not significantly affected by melt composition, fO2 and water concentrations. Therefore, determination of Cu concentrations in amphiboles may be a suitable tool to monitor the evolution of the Cu budget of ore-related magma reservoirs during magma evolution in porphyry cooper systems. In addition, our results showed that Cu is always incompatible in amphibole; therefore, occasionally measured high Cu concentrations in amphibole are likely an artifact of the presence of submicroscopic sulfide inclusions.",

            "abstract": "Rifted margin geometry is too complex and diverse to be explained by simple kinematic models. Instead, we consider the effects of strain localization and the growth of necking instabilities as they apply to rifted margins. The intrinsic layering of the lithosphere will affect the growth rate of necking instabilities, leading to depth-dependent extension. In addition, continents are far from homogeneous after multiple cycles of collision, strike-slip motion and rifting. The resulting inherited heterogeneities may serve to localize strain and initiate necking instabilities.\nWe use 2D finite element models containing embedded finite weak zones in the crust and/or mantle as well as a vertical lithospheric boundary across which lithospheric layering changes resulting in an overall strength contrast. We show that there are two controls on the style of rifting: Control 1, the stiff/pliable nature of the lithospheric layers and; Control 2, the distribution of the background strain rate in the lithosphere. Control 1 depends on the lithospheric rheology, such that necking instabilities grow faster in a stiff, dominantly plastic, layer than in equivalent layers with a pliable, mostly viscous, rheology. Control 2 is important where a strength contrast at a lithospheric boundary influences the distribution of the background strain rate. Necking is a mechanism that amplifies the background strain rate, which implies faster necking in parts of the lithosphere where background strain rates are highest. In a laterally homogeneous lithosphere, the background strain rate will be uniform in each layer and Control 1 will dominate giving necking in stiff layers. However, juxtaposed lithospheres with different strengths will distribute strain giving the weaker lithosphere the higher strain rate, implying the fastest necking may occur under Control 2 in pliable layers with the higher strain rate. An end-member case is where strong lithosphere acts as a rigid block. Here, no necking instability will develop, although inherited weaknesses may be present (Control 2). This has implications for the preservation of cratons, which are cold and strong, and probably stiff. Even though they contain inherited weak heterogeneities, they are protected by Control 2, provided they are surrounded by weakling lithospheres such as younger orogens.",

We focus satellite data that exemplify high O3 and NO2 over Texas’s lower troposphere. Four day back trajectory analyses of all dates show that upper-, mid-, and lower-tropospheric air over Texas, containing high O3, is transported from the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast USA, Midwest USA, Northeast USA, the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Mexico, etc. Only day showed air at 1 km is sourced within Texas. Satellite data show O3 enhancements in the boundary layer and O3 and NO2 enhancements via tropospheric column profiles. These enhancements complement four-day trajectory analysis.

By linking geologic, ecologic, hydrologic, and atmospheric sciences, research in the critical zone has the potential to transform our understanding of natural and managed ecosystems and their responses to environmental change. Emerging research questions include augmenting carbon sequestration by using the connectivity of key processes in the carbon cycle from bedrock to the atmosphere, determining the uses and limits of water as the conduit for materials and energy in the critical zone, and managing minerals as drivers of carbon storage and greenhouse gas dynamics. Future and continued collaborations with other large research networks with complementary expertise will not only strengthen the Critical Zone Network, but also expand the breadth and depth of understanding of the role of the critical zone in global-scale phenomena. Two examples of key networks include the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the US and International Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER). Networks such as these provide value added by broadening the range of climate, rock and soil type, vegetation characteristics, and human land use affecting the critical zone that should help us determine patterns and processes of critical zone function.",

            "abstract": "By combining laboratory and field studies we investigated how increased concentrations of dissolved sulfide in the Delaware inland bays affect the photochemical efficiency of several species of phytoplankton found locally. During the summer months some sites in the Delaware inland bays reach over one millimolar H2S. A Satlantic in situ FIRe (fluorescence induction and relaxation) sensor was used to monitor the changes in the photochemical efficiency, Fv/Fm, of PSII. An in situ voltammetry system was also deployed and used to monitor spatial and temporal changes in O2 and H2S using Au/AuHg microelectrodes. Data will be presented correlating seasonal changes in redox chemistry to in situ values of Fv/Fm, with decreases in Fv/Fm signifying organism stress. Laboratory studies will also be shown that specifically investigate the tolerance of several local phytoplankton species to varying sulfide concentrations and exposure time. Initial field data indicate significant stress in the presence of sulfide with large decreases in Fv/Fm observed. Laboratory data show the negative photochemical response of several local phytoplankton species to H2S concentrations similar to those observed in the Delaware inland bays. These data aim to help improve our understanding on how increasing sulfide concentrations effect photosynthetic processes in the Delaware inland bays, but can also have implications for other ecosystems that undergo seasonal stratification and sulfidic condtions.",

            "abstract": "GeoBus (\nwww.geobus.org.uk\n) is an educational outreach project that was developed in 2012 by the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews, and it is sponsored jointly by industry and the UK Research Councils (NERC and EPSRC). The aims of GeoBus are to support the teaching of Earth Science in secondary (middle and high) schools by providing teaching support to schools that have no or little expertise of teaching Earth science, to share the outcomes of new science research and the experiences of young researchers with school pupils, and to provide a bridge between industry, higher education institutions, research councils and schools. Since its launch, GeoBus has visited over 160 different schools across the length and breadth of Scotland. Over 30,000 pupils will have been involved in experiential Earth science learning activities by December 2014, including many in remote and disadvantaged regions.\nThe challenge with secondary school experiential learning as outreach is that activities need to be completed in either 50 or 80 minutes to fit within the school timetables in the UK, and this can limit the amount of hands-on activities that pupils undertake in one session. However, it is possible to dedicate a whole or half day of linked activities to Earth science learning in Scotland and this provides a long enough period to undertake field work, conduct group projects, or complete more complicated experiments. GeoBus has developed a suite of workshops that all involve experiential learning and are targeted for shorter and longer time slots, and the lessons learned in developing and refining these workshops to maximise the learning achieved will be presented.\nThree potentially unsurprising observations hold true for all the schools that GeoBus visits: young learners like to experiment and use unfamiliar equipment to make measurements, the element of competition stimulates learners to ask questions and maintain focus and enthusiasum, and role playing is an effective way to get learners to participate in group projects and to communicate with each other. Examples of our workshops and experiential learning activities for a range of ages will be presented along with feedback from teachers and young learners.",

            "abstract": "We present field measurements of isoprene, its oxidation products, and an ensemble of other gas- and particle-phase measurements from the SLAQRS campaign during summer 2013 in Greater St. Louis. St. Louis lies near the ‘isoprene volcano’ in the Ozark Plateau, and oscillates between extremely high levels of isoprene and its oxidation products when winds are southerly, and low isoprene levels under northerly winds. During summer 2013 isoprene concentrations peaked at nearly 8 ppb, with the highest amounts occurring at night due to the associated transport time. In this presentation we interpret these measurements in terms of present understanding of isoprene chemistry, and examine their implications for daytime and nighttime chemistry in St. Louis. We pay particular attention to the measured abundance and variability of formic and acetic acids, and the relative importance of biogenic and anthropogenic precursors leading to their production.",

            "abstract": "Climate is the average of weather over some time period and shows characteristic behavior in each time scale. In paleoclimatic research, values of climate variables are measured from proxies that give time series of time-averaged variables. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of time-averaged variable is important to investigate climate variations thorough different time scales.\nIn our recent study, we formulated how stochastic dynamics changes corresponding to averaging time intervals using one dimensional first order stochastic differential equation which contains parametrically controlled terms of deterministic single-well or double-well potential force and random force. The dynamics of time-averaged variable is described by conditional probability density function. In the case of single-well, the function is analytically derived as normal distribution with scaling parameters. In the case of double-well potential, the function is obtained as skew generalized normal distribution function through numerical simulations. The mathematical framework of stochastic dynamics of time-averaged variable is general and applicable to analysis of many kinds of climate time series data.\nIn this study, we apply the above framework to the analysis of proxy data from ice core and discuss about time scaling of the past climate variations. We test several models to infer the optimal model description for the data.",

            "abstract": "We report the results of our extended campaign to search for occultations of background stars by small (sub-km) Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) using the IMACS instrument on the Magellan Telescope. Previously, we implemented a novel shutterless continuous readout mode on the IMACS instrument, able to obtain high-speed photometry on multiple stars, simultaneously generating light curves for all targets with a 36 Hz cadence. Following our pilot study, we extended our observational campaign, improving our target selection methodology such that we can now simultaneously monitor thousands of stars in a crowded field-of-view. We were granted approximately 60 hrs observing time on Magellan in 2014, allowing us to increase our observational data set by almost an order of magnitude, giving us an inticipated 100,000 star-hours of light curves with per-point SNR > 10. We expect that these observation will result in the first ground-based detections of occultations by sub-km objects in the Kuiper-Belt, allowing us to verify and improve upon the sky plane density of sub-km diameter KBOs implied by the HST FGS detections reported by Schlichting et al. (2009, 2012).",

            "abstract": "The main focus of this study is to develop forecast consensus in the extended range prediction (ERP) of monsoon Intraseasonal oscillations using a suit of different variants of Climate Forecast system (CFS) model. In this CFS based Grand MME prediction system (CGMME), the ensemble members are generated by perturbing the initial condition and using different configurations of CFSv2. This is to address the role of different physical mechanisms known to have control on the error growth in the ERP in the 15-20 day time scale. The final formulation of CGMME is based on 21 ensembles of the standalone Global Forecast System (GFS) forced with bias corrected forecasted SST from CFS, 11 low resolution CFST126 and 11 high resolution CFST382. Thus, we develop the multi-model consensus forecast for the ERP of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) using a suite of different variants of CFS model. This coordinated international effort lead towards the development of specific tailor made regional forecast products over Indian region. Skill of deterministic and probabilistic categorical rainfall forecast as well the verification of large-scale low frequency monsoon intraseasonal oscillations has been carried out using hindcast from 2001-2012 during the monsoon season in which all models are initialized at every five days starting from 16May to 28 September. The skill of deterministic forecast from CGMME is better than the best participating single model ensemble configuration (SME). The CGMME approach is believed to quantify the uncertainty in both initial conditions and model formulation. Main improvement is attained in probabilistic forecast which is because of an increase in the ensemble spread, thereby reducing the error due to over-confident ensembles in a single model configuration. For probabilistic forecast, three tercile ranges are determined by ranking method based on the percentage of ensemble members from all the participating models falls in those three categories. CGMME further added value to both deterministic and probability forecast compared to raw SME's and this better skill is probably flows from large spread and improved spread-error relationship. CGMME system is currently capable of generating ER prediction in real time and successfully delivering its experimental operational ER forecast of ISM for the last few years.",

            "abstract": "Huge earthquakes cause vastly stress field change around the rupture zones, and many aftershocks and other related geophysical phenomenon such as geodetic movements have been observed. It is important to figure out the time-spacious distribution during the relaxation process for understanding the giant earthquake cycle. In this study, we pick up the southern rupture area of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M9.0). The seismicity rate keeps still high compared with that before the 2011 earthquake. Many studies using ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) have been doing since soon after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in order to obtain aftershock activity precisely. Here we show one of the studies at off the coast of Fukushima which is located on the southern part of the rupture area caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. We deployed 4 broadband type OBSs (BBOBSs) and 12 short-period type OBSs (SOBS) in August 2012. Other 4 BBOBSs attached with absolute pressure gauges and 20 SOBSs were added in November 2012. We recovered 36 OBSs including 8 BBOBSs in November 2013. We selected 1,000 events in the vicinity of the OBS network based on a hypocenter catalog published by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and extracted the data after time corrections caused by each internal clock. Each P and S wave arrival times, P wave polarity and maximum amplitude were picked manually on a computer display. We assumed one dimensional velocity structure based on the result from an active source experiment across our network, and applied time corrections every station for removing ambiguity of the assumed structure. Then we adopted a maximum-likelihood estimation technique and calculated the hypocenters. The results show that intensive activity near the Japan Trench can be seen, while there was a quiet seismic zone between the trench zone and landward high activity zone.",

            "abstract": "The proportion of women earning undergraduate geoscience degrees has remained about 40% for over a decade. Little research has investigated why women select and persist in a geoscience major. This study addresses why students major in the geosciences and why some programs are more successful at recruiting and retaining female students. We collected interview and survey data from faculty and students at six public US universities. Four sites had a low proportion of female degree recipients (< 38%) and two sites had a high proportion of female degree recipients (> 48%). 408 students (64% female) completed surveys. Interviews were conducted with 49 faculty members and 151 students. Survey data analysis showed that interest/identity and transformative experiences were significant predictors of students' decision to major in geoscience. Institutional barriers and supports were significant predictors of confidence in the major while connection to instructor predicted students' intent to major. Analysis of pre- and post-course surveys show that students with a greater connection to instructors and students whose instructors expressed more passion for the content also reported higher levels of transformative experiences. This effect was especially pronounced for women and was a significant predictor of persistence in the major. Qualitative data show differences in departmental practices and climate between low and high female graduation sites. High sites used many student-centered approaches to teaching, had extensive opportunities for and a high number of undergraduate students involved in research, and had many opportunities for faculty-student interaction outside of class. Low sites had few of these practices. Qualitative data also showed differences in the gendered equity climate between high and low sites. High sites had more positive gender equity climates and low sites had more negative gender equity climates. At this time, we do not fully understand the causal relationships among all of these findings and higher female graduation rates, but this research is ongoing and these relationships are a focus of our final year of this research project.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a major component of the global carbon cycle, with some estimates of the associated emissions reaching 2.5 PgC/yr. This and the other impacts of biomass burning have driven efforts to improve its simulation in Earth system models. Recent global fire models usually include both bioclimatic and anthropogenic drivers of fire, with the latter (via population density and sometimes economic status) serving to increase or suppress burned area. Some models have added the representation of fire used in deforestation and cropland management, the extent and seasonal timing of which may not be accounted for by the usual approach to anthropogenic influence.\nHuman land use can also limit fire by fragmenting landscapes, but this process is not included in most global models. Moreover, although people often use fire to manage grazing lands for livestock, these practices have not been explicitly modeled (except as performed by pre-industrial societies). This could be important for regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where the seasonality of pasture burning tends to differ from that of other lands, potentially influencing savanna-forest dynamics.\nRecent efforts elucidating the effects of cropland and pasture on fire regimes at regional scales provide insight into these processes. Using this new understanding, we have developed a fire model with structurally distinct modules for burning of croplands, pasture, and primary and secondary lands, as well as fire use for deforestation. Parameters for each are rigorously constrained using remote-sensing observations of burned area. This structure allows us to disentangle agricultural practices and fragmentation effects from the endogenous processes driving fire on non-agricultural land, resulting in a better ability to simulate how fire works at large scales. This is critical for modeling the future of fire and all the parts of the Earth system that it affects, including vegetation distributions, nutrient cycling, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions.\nIn this work, we introduce the structure of the fire model and how it was parameterized. We then compare its performance with observations of burned area and previous global fire models, with a focus on regions where cropland or pasture predominates and especially where people use fire in their management.",

            "abstract": "The pre-Cenozoic tectonic history of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) can be broadly described as Triassic rifting, followed by Jurassic seafloor spreading and post-rift igneous activity as well as domal uplifts and rapid subsidence during the Late Cretaceous. Igneous rocks, identified from geophysical data and outcrops, extend from the Uvalde and Balcones volcanic fields in Texas, through northern Louisiana and eastern Arkansas, to the Jackson Dome in Mississippi. How this widespread magmatic event affected the thermal and structural framework of the crust and the sedimentary system in the northern GoM basin, remain poorly understood.\nCompeting hypotheses exist regarding post-rift igneous activity: 1) Magmatism in the northeastern GoM basin is part of the Bermuda hotspot track; 2) The subduction of the Farallon plate caused distant lithospheric flexure and associated igneous activity in the northwestern GoM basin; 3) Edge-driven mantle convection produced melts at the continent-ocean boundary; 4) Grenville and Ouachita sutures led to opportunistic igneous activity.\nPreliminary results show that, instead of an eastward age progressive track, which is predicted by the Bermuda hotspot hypothesis, the spatial distribution and ages of igneous rocks follow the transition between continental and oceanic crust; it also roughly coincides with the Grenville and Ouachita sutures. It is also possible that the shallow-angle subduction of the Farallon plate could trigger magmatism ca. 1500 km from the trench; a modern analog is the subduction of the west Pacific plate and the Changbai volcano in northeast Asia. Here we emphasize the tectonomagmatic evolution of the northern GoM basin; and moreover suggest post-rift magmatism at passive continental margins is likely affected by both edge-driven convection and inherited lithospheric structures.",

Whipple will reach much deeper into the unexplored frontier of the outer solar system than any other mission, current or proposed. Whipple will look back to the dawn of the solar system by discovering its most remote bodies where primordial processes left their imprint.\nSpecifically, Whipple will monitor large numbers of stars at high cadences (~12,000 stars at 20 Hz to examine Kuiper Belt events; as many as ~36,000 stars at 5 Hz to explore deep into the Oort Cloud, where events are less frequent). Analysis of the detected events will allow us to determine the size spectrum of bodies in the Kuiper Belt with radii as small as ~1 km. This will allow the testing of models of the growth and later collisional erosion of planetesimals in the early solar system. Whipple will explore the Oort Cloud, detecting objects as far out as ~10,000 AU. This will be the first direct exploration of the Oort Cloud since the original hypothesis of 1950.\nWhipple is a Discovery class mission that will be proposed to NASA in response to the 2014 Announcement of Opportunity. The mission is being developed jointly by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Jet Propulsion Laboratories, and Ball Aerospace & Technologies, with telescope optics from L-3 Integrated Optical Systems.",

            "abstract": "Combined U-Pb-Hf isotope studies of zircons provide new insights into the evolution of large-scale, long-term orogenic systems, applicable to understanding supercontinental cycles throughout Earth history. Three types of Hf arrays exist on Phanerozoic Earth: (1) long term isotopic contraction to positive epilson Hf values, reflecting circum-Pacific type orogenesis; (2) fanning isotopic array associated with ongoing collisional orogenesis involving repeated Wilson-cycles; (3) crustal reworking arrays typical of backarc opening and closing during slow convergence of continents, such as Phanerozoic Europe.\nEach Phanerozoic array has its Precambrian precursors, at least to 3.0 Ga. Global isotopic contraction similar to the Phanerozoic circum-Pacific system is also recorded between 2.0-1.6 Ga, and less obviously between 2.8-2.5 Ga, suggesting global scale symmetrical subduction systems dominated by accretionary orogenesis since the Late Archean. Fanning arrays between 2.2-1.8 Ga and 1.2-0.6 Ga reflect dominantly collisional processes associated with amalgamation of Nuna and Gondwana, whereas the Mesoproterozoic (1.6-1.2 Ga) produces a dominantly reworking array like that of Phanerozoic Europe.\nCircum-Pacific subduction reflects hemispheric-scale, whole mantle convection and probably began approximately 2.8 Ga ago. Global scale accretionary orogens associated with this arrangement include the widespread Late Archean greenstone belts and the circum-Nuna Late Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts. The Mesoproterozoic era possibly represents progressive, slow collapse of a Panthalassic ocean surrounding Nuna, ultimately forming the Grenvillean orogenic system. This climactic event rearranged global mantle convection patterns, observed in the Neoproterozoic “Pan-African” Hf arrays, triggering a peculiar toroidal-type mantle convective cell that transitioned Rodinia to Gondwana.",

            "abstract": "Within the LSBB National Underground Research Laboratory (France), we performed an in situ multidisciplinary and multi-scale analysis of a small fault zone intersecting a layered carbonates reservoir. The study area is located in a gallery at 250 m depth in the unsaturated and unaltered zone of the reservoir. In order to study the distribution of the fault zone properties, we took advantage of the gallery wall and of three vertical 20 m long boreholes located near the fault core, in the damage zone, and in the host rock. Geological, petrophysical (porosity observations and measurements), geotechnical (Q-value) and geophysical measurements (acoustic velocities, uniaxial compressive strength, electrical resistivity, borehole logging), and injection tests were conducted at various scales. We show that horizontal and vertical variations in hydromechanical properties within the damage zone are related to the initial petrophysical properties of the host rock. In the initial low-porosity and fractured layers, the deformations are accommodated by fractures and micro-cracks extending significantly from the fault core. In these layers, the Young modulus of the rock mass (Em) is low and the permeability of the rock mass (Km) is high. In the initial porous and low fractured layers, deformations are accommodated by micro-mechanical processes resulting in a decrease in micro-porosity near the fault core. There is a rapid attenuation of the damage zone. In these layers, Em is high and Km is low. The seismic signature of this kind of fault is complex and the seismic visibility low making them hard to detect. Finally, to assess fault zone stability in case of CO2 injection and the risk of CO2 leakage through the fault itself, we performed some geomechanical numerical simulations and some field hydromechanical tests. We show that the presence of hydromechanical heterogeneity favors the fluid accumulation but strengthen the fault zone and impede fluid migration upward along the fault.",

OBSIP provides both short period instruments (for active source seismic refraction studies) and long period instruments (for long term passive experiments). OBSIP is comprised of three Institutional Instrument Contributors each of whom contribute instruments and technical support to the pool and an OBSIP Management Office.\nIn the past year, OBSIP has provided instruments for five experiments and supported over 12 research cruises recovering and/or deploying instruments. The most extensive OBSIP experiment in the past few years has been the Cascadia Initiative. The Cascadia Initiative is an onshore/offshore seismic and geodetic experiment deployed in the Pacific Northwest to study questions surrounding the evolution of the Juan de Fuca plate and the Gorda plate. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), OBSIP IIC's built 60 new ocean bottom seismometers. Both LDEO and SIO designed new seismometer packages to withstand trawling by local fisherman for deployment in shallow areas. The Cascadia Initiative has required close cooperation between the OBSIP, the Deep Submergence Facility, the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (who coordinates ship schedules for the cruises), and the Cascadia Initiative Expedition Team.\nAt the recent ARRA Workshop, members from the scientific community met to discuss the future of the ARRA instruments and determine how OBS instrumentation can be best utilized to serve the scientific community. The OBSIP Management Office has developed a comprehensive Data Quality Plan that includes all steps of the data collection process, from instrument design to quality controlling data after it is uploaded to the Data Management Center. The OBSIP Management Office and the IICs are starting to review current data quality practices as the first step in the Data Quality Plan.

            "abstract": "Feeding the world requires 70 percent more food for an additional 2.3 billion people by 2050. The increasing competition for water resources prompts the modern consumer society to become more efficient with scarce water resources. The water footprint of agriculture is hundred times more than the footprint for domestic water use, yet we do not fully know how much water is used in relation to the amount of food being produced. Water Productivity describes the crop yield per unit of water consumed and is the ultimate indicator for the efficiency of water use in agriculture. Our basic understanding of actual and benchmark values for Water Productivity is limited, partially because operational measurements and guidelines for Water Productivity do not currently exist.\nRemote sensing algorithms have been developed over the last 20 years to compute crop yield Y and evapotranspiration ET, often in an independent manner. The new WatPro and GlobWat algorithms are based on directly solving the Y/ET ratio. Several biophysical parameter and processes such as solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, stomatal aperture and soil moisture affect biomass production and crop transpiration simultaneously, and this enabled us to simplify the schematization of a Y/ET model. Global maps of wheat, rice and maize were prepared from various open-access data sources, and Y/ET was computed across a period of 10 years.\nThe global distribution demonstrates that 66 percent of the world’s agricultural land cultivated with wheat, rice and corn performs below average. Furthermore, Water Productivity in most countries exhibits a significant spatial variability. Therefore, there is significant scope to produce the same food - or more food - from less water resources if packages with good practices are locally implemented. The global maps of water productivity will be demonstrated, along with some country examples. ",

            "abstract": "Carbonate rocks undergo karstic process and karst morphology is a key to understand the nature and genesis of caves. The primary energy source for the formation of karst landforms is hydrological cycle. Geomorphic features along with hydrological characteristics provide important information not only on karst formation but also climate and environmental conditions. In this paper, we present the tectonic and geomorphic features that played a role in evolution of caves located in Chhattisgarh and Orissa States of India. The geomorphic and tectonic aspects of Kotumsar, Kailash, and Gupteshwar caves are discussed in relation to the origin and evolution of these caves.\nCaves are located near the water falls. The area is folded and faulted along the Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) due to tectonic reactivation. Shaly-limestone beds exhibit vertical dipping near Gupteshwar cave, and steeply inclined near Kotumsar and Kailash caves. Indrāvati and Sabari/Kolab tributaries of the Godavari River drain the area.\nThe landscape evolution and the origin of caves in the region is a multistage process, where the lithology, orogeny, fluvial action, and monsoon are the main agents, which is similar to the four state model (Ford and Ewers, 1978). The river basin evolution and regional tectonism also caused the initiation of karstification in the region.\nThe evolution of caves is believed to have taken place in Pre-Pliocene under more humid conditions that coincided with the initiation of monsoon in India. Further, during the Quaternary wet-dry/cold-warm phases altered physical and chemical weathering of limestone rocks. Contrasting relief features of Bastar plateau have also helped the extensive cave formation in the region. The dissolution along weak planes initiated the openings of caves, further enlarged by geomorphic agents. Both monsoon and tectonics have caused fluctuations in water levels along river courses, which acted as active agents in evolution of caves.",

            "abstract": "Investigators in the natural sciences have long been frustrated by the slow diffusion of increasing knowledge about the potential impacts of climate change into policy and decision making about the management of those system most likely to be affected. This presentation uses information based on the case study of a recent project that worked closely with water managers to incorporate stochastic climate conditions into two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2) in order to examine the downstream impacts of reservoir operations at Shasta Lake in northern California. The inclusion of reservoir operational rules was incorporated into the coupled model in order to better represent the operating conditions under which management decisions are made. Shasta Dam utilizes a unique temperature control device (TCD) that allows water releases from multiple levels of the reservoir in order to control downstream temperatures and meet management guidelines for Chinook salmon. The case study illustrates how three characteristics of a decision system influence the use of climate science: (i) the built structural components of ecosystem service delivery, (ii) institutional rule structures that include regulatory systems, operational rules, and informal decision criteria, (iii) decision systems used to manage competing demands on a natural resource. Additional cases are used to develop a general framework for understanding under what conditions climate science can provide information useful to decision makers.",

            "abstract": "We study wavefield effects in elastic isotropic 3-D seismic structures derived from the temperature field of a high resolution mantle circulation model. More specifically, we quantify the structural dispersion of traveltime residuals of direct P- and S-waves in a model with realistic length-scales and magnitudes of the variations in seismic velocities and density. 3-D global wave propagation is simulated using a spectral element method, and traveltime residuals are measured in four different frequency bands by cross-correlation of 3-D and 1-D synthetic waveforms. Intrinsic (dissipative) attenuation is deliberately neglected, so that any variation of traveltimes with frequency can be attributed to structural effects. Additional simulations are performed for a model in which 3-D structure is removed in the upper 800 km to isolate the dispersion signal of the lower mantle. One question that we address is whether the structural length-scales inherent to a vigorously convecting mantle give rise to significant body-wave dispersion.\nIn our synthetic dataset, the difference between long-period and short-period traveltime residuals generally increases with increasing short-period residual. However, we do not find an exact linear dependence, and in case of P-waves even non-monotonic behaviour. At largest short-period residuals, average dispersion is on the order of 2 s for both P- and S-waves and even larger when structure is confined to the lower mantle. Dispersion also appears to be asymmetric; that is, larger for negative than for positive residuals. The standard deviations of both P- and S-wave residuals also increase with increasing period and we discuss possible explanations for this behaviour. Overall, wavefield effects in both models are generally stronger for P-waves than for S-waves at the same frequencies.\nWe also find that for certain combinations of periods, the difference between the respective residuals is very similar between the \"whole mantle\" and the \"lower mantle\" model. Signals from upper mantle structure seem to mostly cancel in these cases, at least for certain length-scales. \"Differential-frequency\" traveltime residuals could thus represent a new seismological observable that may prove useful for tomographic studies of the lower mantle.",

It has been investigated during the Haiti-SIS cruise (November-December 2012) by heat flow measurements and coring. These two strike-slip fault systems accommodate the relative motion between the Caribbean and North American plates. An aftershock study of the MW= 7, 12 January 2010 earthquake indicated that this event originated along the EPGF fault, while the septentrional fault has not been ruptured for about a century.\nWe focused coring operations on specific zones; faults, basin margins, ridge, deep basins delimated using structural/sedimentological surface data. The objective of the pore-fluid study was to determine both the pathways of the fluids and their origin in relation with the fault activity.\nA total of 14 Kullenberg cores were collected for fluid sampling and sedimentological analyses. Overall, 99 pore fluids were extracted, using Rhizon® samplers. Major and minor dissolved elements were analyzed. The resulting dataset allows us to identify several diagenetic processes occurring within the upper section of the sedimentary column. For the fault-crossing zones, the vertical chloride and sulphate profiles where the dissolved-element concentrations are close to that of normal seawater suggest seawater downward flow (infiltration). There the faults would then act as recharge zones for fluid circulation. On the opposite, for cores recovered in the basins, dissolved element profiles exhibit variable shapes with sulfate concentration decreasing with depth (indicating organic matter oxydation or anaerobic oxidation of methane) These results will be combined with those from the emerged segment of the EPGF (that can be observed on land in Haiti) in order to have a picture of the hydrologic regime of the fault system, its capacity to act as a recharge zone and conversely to supply deep-seated fluids to the surface (discharge zones).",

However, U/Ca has not been conclusively linked to carbonate chemistry and/or temperature in laboratory experiments. We have performed abiogenic precipitation experiments designed to evaluate the sensitivity of U partitioning between aragonite and seawater to temperature, pH, and the concentration of carbonate ion in seawater. Aragonite was precipitated from seawater by addition of carbonate alkalinity at rates set to maintain stable carbonate chemistry during precipitation. Experiments were conducted between 20-40 °C, pH 7.8-9.0, and carbonate ion concentration 600-2600 µmol kg-1. Mineralogies of the precipitates were identified by Raman spectrometry and U/Ca ratios of the bulk precipitate and fluid were determined by solution ICP-MS. Our results show that the U/Ca ratio of aragonite precipitated from an infinite reservoir of seawater decreases with increasing carbonate ion concentration, and is independent of pH and temperature. Using our abiogenic results as a basis for interpreting coral skeletal chemistry, we model the coral biomineralization process to show that the U/Ca ratio of coral skeleton reflects a calcifying fluid with carbonate ion concentration of at least 1000 µmol kg-1, several times greater than ambient seawater. Further, we show that the coral biomineralization response to environmental changes can be linked to changes in calcifying fluid composition via skeletal U/Ca ratios.",

            "abstract": "Vegetated filter strips (VFSs) have been recognized as an effective and environmentally-friendly beneficial management practice for preventing sediments from cropland to enter surface water. Their trapping efficiency depends on many parameters (characteristics of the filter, vegetation, flow and sediments) and may be balanced with other factors such as implementation, management and opportunity costs. The Vegetated Filter Dimensioning Model (VFDM) is a mathematical tool coupled with PHYSITEL and HYDROTEL that was successfully developed to determine the optimal dimensions and/or efficiency of vegetated filters with respect to vegetation characteristics, topographical and hydrological parameters.\nThe number of rills in a relatively homogeneous hydrological unit (RHHU, i.e. hillslope), the basic computational unit of VFDM, is a key parameter for the calculation of the surface runoff velocity, and therefore, the design of the vegetative filter. Until now, this parameter had been treated as a constant based on plan shape of each individual hillslope.\nThe main objective of this project was to develop an algorithm for determining a priori potential areas where rills could develop and implement the ensuing procedure in VFDM. With the proposed algorithm, the number of rills is determined by using physical and hydrological criteria. To study the influence of concentrated flow and diffuse flow in the filter dimensioning calculations, surface runoff is apportioned according to the way it reaches the primary stream network (concentrated, if through the aforementioned rills, or diffuse, otherwise, that is if discharging laterally). By considering actual land covers and identifying areas likely to generate sediments, results can lead to the building of hotspot maps that may be used as decision-making tools to guide the implementation of vegetated filter strips at the watershed scale.\nThe potential use of the algorithm was tested using data form a small (2.5 km2) agricultural watershed in Quebec (Canada) and a sensitivity analysis of the main outputs of VFDM, the width and efficiency of the filter strip, was performed with respect to key parameters (vegetation density, rill width among others).",

            "abstract": "Extreme weather events have profound consequences for both the mean and interannual variability of agricultural production, but while the role of extreme heat has been convincingly demonstrated, soil water supply has received less attention. In particular, there is debate over the extent to which damages attributed to extreme heat are confounded with drought conditions. In a pair of studies, we examine the effect of extreme moisture conditions, both wet and dry, on maize and soybean yields in the U.S. We find significant effects of waterlogging during the planting season, when crops are most vulnerable to excess moisture, as well as evidence for a strong interaction between high temperatures and low moisture during during the critical stages of the summer growing season. Using both precipitation and model-derived soil moisture data, our results suggest that considering temperature and moisture independently will underestimate yield damages during hot, dry conditions. Many warming scenarios project increases in both extreme summer temperatures and soil dryness, and considering these effects jointly can be important in estimating future yield variability.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the troposphere is critical for the understanding of emissions and physical and chemical processes that can impact both air quality and climate. Airborne VOC measurements have proven especially challenging due to the requirement of both high sensitivity (pptv) and short sample collection times (≤15 s) to maximize spatial resolution and sampling frequency for targeted plume analysis. The use of stainless steel canisters to collect whole air samples (WAS) for post-flight analysis has been pioneered by the groups of D. Blake and E. Atlas [Blake et al., 1992; Atlas et al., 1993].\nFor the 2013 Southeast Nexus Study (SENEX), the NOAA ESRL CSD laboratory undertook WAS measurements for the first time. This required the construction of three new, highly-automated, and field-portable instruments designed to sample, analyze, and clean the canisters for re-use. Analysis was performed with a new custom-built gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system. The instrument pre-concentrates analyte cryostatically into two parallel traps by means of a Stirling engine, a novel technique which obviates the need for liquid nitrogen to reach trapping temperatures of -175C.\nHere we present an evaluation of the retrieval of target VOC species from WAS canisters. We discuss the effects of humidity and sample age on the analyte, particularly upon C8+ alkane and aromatic species and biogenic species. Finally, we present results from several research flights during SENEX that targeted emissions from oil/natural gas production.",

            "abstract": "Microseismic monitoring has been used for the last 20 years as a tool to understand the landslide mechanisms and to help develop a methodology able to provide real time information regarding landslide behavior. These studies involve deployment of seismic sensors at active slopes, with data usually analyzed and interpreted along with data obtained using other monitoring methods, e.g. geodetic/geotechnical monitoring. The interpretation of the records is based on a number of assumptions regarding the nature of the recorded signals resulting in big uncertainties.\nIn order to overcome this problem, we use an up-scaled sheer box to reproduce seismic signals as those emitted by the movement of a landslide. The experimental set up consists of a 65cm diameter and 50cm high concrete cylinder filled with unsaturated soil. The cylinder is pulled along a surficial corridor with the same type of soil under varying vertical loading conditions and the friction at the interface between the soil in cylinder and soil on corridor emits seismic signals. The signals are recorded by a network of 7 short period 3D seismic sensors at distances ranging from 4 to 15m from the cylinder.\nWe analyse the recorded signals in the frequency and time-frequency domain. The obtained significant frequencies range up to 120Hz. Their amplitude changes depending on the source-to-sensor distance (attenuation effect) and the applied vertical load (simulating different depths of the failure plane). The spectral characteristics of the emitted signals when compared to those of signals emitted from a vertical face failure in very similar geological and loading conditions at a nearby site are consistent. Therefore, this experimental set-up is a good analogue for the study of landslide induced seismicity.\nThe suggested methodology can be a powerful tool in studying the effects of the type of soil, the loading conditions on the failure plane, the degree of saturation and compaction of the soil on signals recorded during the microseismic monitoring of landslides. It allows for the study and understanding of landslide induced seismicity prior to any failure events allowing simulation of different failure scenarios and the creation of a database of signal characteristics that can be used for an accurate interpretation of the available microseismic records.",

            "abstract": "Model integration bridges the data flow between modeling frameworks and models. However, models usually do not fit directly into a particular modeling environment, if not designed for it. An example includes implementing different types of models into the NASA Land Information System (LIS), a software framework for land-surface modeling and data assimilation. Model implementation requires scientific knowledge and software expertise and may take a developer months to learn LIS and model software structure. Debugging and testing of the model implementation is also time-consuming due to not fully understanding LIS or the model. This time spent is costly for research and operational projects.\nTo address this issue, an approach has been developed to automate model integration into LIS. With this in mind, a general model interface was designed to retrieve forcing inputs, parameters, and state variables needed by the model and to provide as state variables and outputs to LIS. Every model can be wrapped to comply with the interface, usually with a FORTRAN 90 subroutine. Development efforts need only knowledge of the model and basic programming skills. With such wrappers, the logic is the same for implementing all models. Code templates defined for this general model interface could be re-used with any specific model. Therefore, the model implementation can be done automatically.\nAn automated model implementation toolkit was developed with Microsoft Excel and its built-in VBA language. It allows model specifications in three worksheets and contains FORTRAN 90 code templates in VBA programs. According to the model specification, the toolkit generates data structures and procedures within FORTRAN modules and subroutines, which transfer data between LIS and the model wrapper. Model implementation is standardized, and about 80 – 90% of the development load is reduced.\nIn this presentation, the automated model implementation approach is described along with LIS programming interfaces, the general model interface and five case studies, including a regression model, Noah-MP, FASST, SAC-HTET/SNOW-17, and FLake. These different models vary in complexity with software structure. Also, we will describe how these complexities were overcome through using this approach and results of model benchmarks within LIS.",

            "abstract": "The central Argentine Andes exhibit variable morphology along-strike due to some combination of slab subduction angle, inherited crustal structure, and climate. Structural mapping and thermochronology has suggested minimal exhumation (~1 km), except perhaps along some major river valleys. However, few thermochronologic results have been reported. In order to better understand the variability of exhumation along-strike, we sampled 3 rivers for detrital zircon and measured both (U-Th)/He and U-Pb ages using laser ablation methods. The sample sites span the southern edge of flat-slab subduction. The northern- and southernmost watersheds each cover ~2000 km2 and include elements of both the Principal and Frontal Cordilleras. The central watershed (~200 km2) is largely restricted to the Frontal Cordillera. The geology of the Principal Cordillera is diverse, but the Frontal Cordillera is composed primarily of Permo-Triassic volcanic rocks of the Choiyoi Formation. Preliminary results (n = 27) from the smaller, central Arroyo Grande watershed show that zircons are almost always reset, in the sense that a given zircon’s (U-Th)/He cooling age is significantly younger than its U-Pb crystallization age. Of these, 2 grains have cooling ages <5 Ma, and 7 have ages <25 Ma. To the south, in the larger Rio Tunuyan (n = 27) watershed, 13 reset zircons have cooling ages <5 Ma, and 6 of these have U-Pb ages that are characteristic of the Frontal Cordillera (ranging from 220 to 272 Ma). To the north, in the upper Río de los Patos catchment (n = 30), only 3 reset zircons have ages <25 Ma, and these zircons lack Frontal Cordilleran U-Pb ages (17, 43, and 323 Ma). The abundance of reset (U-Th)/He ages is notable in all 3 watersheds. Laser (U-Th)/He closure temperatures vary according to the geometry of the zircon, the geometry of the laser spot, and the cooling rate. For an average zircon among our samples, at an assumed cooling rate of 10° C/Myr, the closure temperature is approximately 200° C. This implies at least several kilometers of exhumation, even if the geothermal gradient is very steep. Sections of the watersheds appear to have been exhumed very rapidly. These preliminary results suggest that the Frontal Cordillera, particularly in the southern and central watersheds, have accommodated much more exhumation than previously thought.",

The goal is that gallery visitors gain greater appreciation and understanding of both—and of the sober content of the show as a whole.\n\"small problems, Big Trouble\" premiers in Wisconsin April, 2015. As in previous collaborations, Waller and Brey actively utilize art and science (specifically geoscience) as an educational vehicle for active student learning. Planned are interdisciplinary university and area high school activities linked through spBT. The exhibition in a public gallery offers a means to enhance community awareness of and action on scientific issues through art’s power to engage people on an emotional level.\nThis AGU presentation includes a description of past Waller and Brey activities: incorporating art and earth science in lab and studio classrooms, producing gallery and museum exhibitions and delivering workshops and other presentations. They also describe how walking the paths of several past earth science disasters continues to inspire new chapters in their \"Layers: Places in Peril\" exhibit!

            "abstract": "We present a new model to monitor the cycle of erosion occurring on the seaward edge of salt marshes as sea level rises. In our model, a southern New England salt marsh edge is stable when the bank edge exhibits a normal slope, is fringed by the low-marsh grass Spartina alterniflora, and the ribbed mussel Guekensia demissa is abundant. As erosion proceeds, the seaward bank becomes vertical (Stage 1), then undercut (Stage 2), then slumped (Stage 3), and finally a detached island (Stage 4) to expose a new vertical bank. If erosion progresses relatively slowly, S. alterniflora will dominate and G. demissa will be abundant.\nWe applied this model to four sites at the Barn Island Salt Marsh in southeastern Connecticut. The central headland of the heavily mosquito-ditched Headquarters Marsh appears to be the most rapidly retreating: from 2006 to 2014, the seaward bank advanced two erosional stages and lost 3 m horizontally. This headland is dominated by low-marsh S. alterniflora, with mid-marsh grasses Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens also present on the seaward edge. By comparison, the nearby seaward edge of Wequetequock Point has only S. alterniflora and bare patches with no mid-marsh species. Wequetequock Point also appears more stable, with about one quarter of the seaward bank on a normal slope and abundant mussels (mean 4,500 m-2; max 20,000 m-2).\nRepeat surveys since 2006 show mussel vacancy rate is related to the rate of erosion. Open holes appear in normal slope banks due to wave erosion of rocks and other material embedded in the exposed peat. Banks that remain in the same erosion stage for multiple years show increased mussel occupation of these holes. In contrast, rapidly eroding banks at Barn Island Marsh have very few mussels (<100 m-2) and are typically fringed by grasses other than S. alterniflora. Much of the Barn Island Marsh bank is eroding too rapidly for mussel settlement and growth and normal marsh grass succession. In addition to documenting the recent rates and mechanisms of marsh loss, using a model that combines multiple indicators of marsh edge stability can help us assess the vulnerability of salt marshes to sea level rise and storms.",

            "abstract": "In many parts of the world, the frequency of large flood events appears to have increased. Although it is impossible to associate any particular event with climate change, there is a general perception that climate change may be at least part of the reason for changes in the statistical distribution of floods. The Red River, sometimes called the Red River of the North, originates at the borders of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota and flows north through the Province of Manitoba before emptying into Lake Winnipeg. There have been several severe spring floods on the Red River in recent years, creating speculation that increased greenhouse gas concentrations are changing the frequency of floods. In this study, we investigate whether this is a reasonable assumption based on global climate model output. A regression model has been developed to predict spring peak discharge on the Red River at a streamflow gage located at the border of the US and Canada. The predictor variables include antecedent fall precipitation used as a proxy for soil moisture at freeze-up, winter snow accumulation, and spring precipitation during the period of melt. Data from the CMIP5 GCM model ensemble are used to determine change factors for the predictor variables. The modified predictor variables are then used to produce scenarios of floods in a changed climate. The use of multiple GCMs and multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) allows for an estimate of uncertainty to be associated with the results.",

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that the long term increase in Subantarctic opal export during glacial periods, centered around 1 Ma, is related to enhanced iron deposition and, potentially, carbon dioxide drawdown. New bulk sedimentary and diatom-bound nitrogen isotope records are used in combination with opal accumulation data from ODP Site 1090 to investigate controls on export production over the last 3 Ma. Sedimentary nitrogen content tracks opal during periods of high iron accumulation, especially after ~1 Ma. Bulk sedimentary nitrogen isotope trends are negatively correlated with sedimentary N-content and opal accumulation. This may be signal weaker nutrient consumption during times of high production, perhaps as a result of enhanced vertical nutrient supply. Alternatively, this variation in bulk, where high values occur in organic poor intervals, is consistent with other evidence for nitrogen isotopic alteration during periods of low export to the seafloor. The diatom-bound nitrogen isotope record does not have a clear relationship with opal or iron accumulation. A long term shift in the diatom-bound N isotope values is apparent, where the average diatom-bound δ15N from 0.5-1 Ma is 4.4 ‰, and from 2-2.6 Ma is 5.9 ‰. This decrease may reflect long-term changes in nitrate availability. A first order comparison to planktonic/benthic carbon isotopic gradients suggests that enhanced vertical mixing may explain the observed productivity peaks and lower overall diatom-bound N isotope values in the interval centered around 1 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Forest fires affect water quality in the disrupted watershed, which can devastate the aquatic ecosystem including sensitive trout (Salmonidae) and macroinvertebrate species. The West Fork Fire Complex consumed 88,724 acres of forest in the state of Colorado during the summer of 2013. The majority (88%) of the burn area was comprised of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) trees killed previously by Spruce Beetle (Ips spp.). Damage to the soils was of moderate to high severity in the majority of the area (60%). The recent fire surrounded the Rio Grande, affecting water quality and habitat critical to insects and fish. The water quality of the Rio Grande (above and below the burn) and some of the effected tributaries is currently being monitored for both quality and quantity. Parameters important to the survival of aquatic life, such as flow, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, turbidity, nutrients, and suspended and dissolved metals are being monitored along the Rio Grande and in tributaries. Macroinvertebrate and fish populations are sampled in the same locations. First year observations showed the ecosystem to be relatively resilient, with stable water quality and survival of insects and fish. However, an intense monsoon season this summer is driving extensive sediments into tributaries from steep, severely burned hillslopes. These monsoon events have caused acute and dramatic fish kills, where hundreds of trout were reported killed in one tributary in a single day event. Turbidity was observed as high as 488 NTU in the impacted stream with fish kill, whereas the turbidity was 25 NTU in a neighboring tributary outside of the burn area. Salmonids can be negatively impacted by relatively low turbidity, with prior studies noting that the turbidity threshold for rainbow trout is 70 NTU. Continued monitoring of water quality, macroinvertebrate populations, and fish populations is being undertaken to determine the key drivers of the acute fish kill events. This presentation will highlight the role of burn severity, steepness of slope, hill aspect, and storm intensity on water quality and aquatic response of fire-impacted streams of the Upper Rio Grande.",

GIADA is composed of 3 sub-systems: the GDS (Grain Detection System), based on grain detection through light scattering; an IS (Impact Sensor), giving momentum measurement detecting the impact on a sensed plate connected with 5 piezoelectric sensors; the MBS (MicroBalances System), constituted of 5 Quartz Crystal Microbalances (QCMs), giving cumulative deposited dust mass by measuring the variations of the sensors’ frequency. The combination of the measurements performed by these 3 subsystems provides: the number, the mass, the momentum and the velocity distribution of dust grains emitted from the cometary nucleus.No prior in situ dust dynamical measurements at these close distances from the nucleus and starting from such large heliocentric distances are available up to date. We present here the first results obtained from the beginning of the Rosetta scientific phase. We will report dust grains early detection at about 800 km from the nucleus in August 2014 and the following measurements that allowed us characterizing the 67P/C-G dust environment at distances less than 100 km from the nucleus and single grains dynamical properties.\n Acknowledgements.

            "abstract": "As climate changes, the final date of spring snowmelt is projected to occur earlier in the year within the western United States. This earlier snowmelt timing may impact crop yield in snow-dominated watersheds by changing the timing of water delivery to agricultural fields. There is considerable uncertainty about how agricultural impacts of snowmelt timing may vary by region, crop-type, and practices like irrigation vs. dryland farming. Establishing the relationship between snowmelt timing and agricultural yield is important for understanding how changes in large-scale climatic indices (like snowmelt date) may be associated with changes in agricultural yield. A better understanding of the influence of changes in snowmelt on non-irrigated crop yield may additionally be extrapolated to better understand how climate change may alter biomass production in non-managed ecosystems. We utilized parametric regression techniques to isolate the magnitude of impact snowmelt timing has had on historical crop yield independently of climate and spatial variables that also impact yield. To do this, we examined the historical relationship between snowmelt timing and non-irrigated wheat and barley yield using a multiple linear regression model to predict yield in several Idaho counties as a function of snowmelt date, climate variables (precipitation and growing degree-days), and spatial differences between counties. We utilized non-parametric techniques to determine where snowmelt timing has positively versus negatively impacted yield. To do this, we developed classification and regression trees to identify spatial controls (e.g. latitude, elevation) on the relationship between snowmelt timing and yield.\nMost trends suggest a decrease in crop yield with earlier snowmelt, but a significant opposite relationship is observed in some regions of Idaho. An earlier snowmelt date occurring at high latitudes corresponds with higher than average wheat yield. Therefore, Northern Idaho may benefit from planting wheat in years with early snowmelt timing. Barley grown in counties with low elevation and low topography may also benefit from early snowmelt timing. Despite the beneficial relationship in some counties, wheat and barley yield have been lower on average in past years with early snowmelt timing in most of Idaho.",

            "abstract": "The sun is a powerful force that has proven to our society that it has a large impact on our lives. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of awareness on how the sun is capable of affecting Earth. The over all idea of “Reading The Sun” installation is to help demonstrate how the sun impacts the Earth, by compiling various data sources from satellites (SOHO, SDO, and STERO) with solar and solar wind models (MAS and ENLIL) to create a comprehensive three dimensional display of the solar environment. It focuses on the current solar maximum of solar cycle 24 and a CME that impacted Earth’s magnetic field on February 27, 2014, which triggered geomagnetic storms around the Earth’s poles. The CME was an after-effect of a class X4.9 solar flare, which was released from the sun on February 25, 2014. “Reading The Sun” is a 48” x 48” x 48” hanging model of the sun with color coded open opposing magnetic field lines along with various layers of the solar atmosphere, the heliospheric current sheet, and the inner planets. At the center of the xyz axis is the sun with the open magnetic field lines and the heliospheric current sheet permeating inner planetary space. The xyz axes are color coded to represent various types of information with corresponding visual images for the viewer to be able to read the model. Along the z-axis are three colors (yellow, orange, and green) that represent the different layers of the solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, and corona) that correspond to three satellite images in various spectrums related to a CME and Solar Flare and the xy-plane shows where the inner planets are in relation to the sun.\n The exhibit in which “Reading The Sun “is being displayed is called, The Rotation of Language at the Wheather Again Gallery in Rockaway, New York. The intent of the exhibit is to both celebrate as well as present a cautionary tale on the ability of human language to spark and ignite the individual and collective imagination towards an experience simultaneously approaching the utopian as well as the dystopian.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric dust can be used to record climate change in addition to itself playing a role in several key climate processes, such as affecting Earth’s albedo, fomenting rain coalescence, encouraging biological productivity, and enhancing carbon export though particle sinks. Using deep sea sediments, it is possible to quantify and locate the sources and sinks of atmospheric dust. A key area of research is the shift in the inter-tropical converge zone (ITCZ), a thermally influenced area that shifts according to the northern and southern hemisphere temperature gradient. This ongoing project focuses on the changes of the ITCZ over the Central Equatorial Pacific (CEP) over the past ~25000 years. The research focuses on two cores taken from the Line Islands Ridge at 0° 29' N (ML1208-18GC), and 4° 41' N (ML1208-31BB). The main aim is to quantify the magnitude and provenance of windblown dust deposited in the CEP, and to address questions regarding the nature of the variations of dust through ice-age climate transitions.\nRadiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb) have been successfully used to distinguish between different potential dust sources in the aluminosilicates fractions of Pacific Sediments. Our preliminary Pb isotope ratios suggest that, for modern deposition, the northern core’s (31BB) detrital sediment fraction is likely sourced from Asian Loess (average ratios are 206Pb/204Pb = 18.88, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.69, 208Pb/204Pb = 39.06). The equatorial core’s (18GC) detrital fraction has a less radiogenic Pb signature, which is consistent with South American dust sourcing (206Pb/204Pb = 18.62, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.63, 208Pb/204Pb = 38.62). This is indicative of a strong modern ITCZ that acts as an effective barrier for inter-hemispheric dust transport. Prior to Holocene time, the changes in Pb isotope ratios in both cores appear to be in anti-phase; the northern core becomes less radiogenic up to the LGM, while the southern core becomes more radiogenic. This is potentially due to a weakening of the ITCZ during glacial times. Future work on Nd isotope will shed additional light on subtle differences in dust isotopic composition within the source regions of interest, including the different volcanic zones of South America.",

Long-term research sites, such as the Fernow Experimental Forest serve as the regions bellwether for ecological change. Nevertheless, few studies have quantified the long term impacts of forest treatment and climate change on streamflow for the catchments of the Fernow. This study serves this roll by accessing the change in water and energy balance of four catchments (WS-1, WS-4, WS-6, WS-7) subject to forest harvest, natural and suppressed regrowth, and stand conversion. We apply the Budyko framework to quantify the relative contributions of climate and land cover changes on annual streamflow between two time periods and over a five year interval spanning 1951-2011. Based on this analysis land-use, forest succession, and climate change-variability are differentially impacting streamflow. In the two-period analysis climate change is responsible for on average 3 % change in mean annual runoff (MAR). Forest harvest and/or succession caused changes in MAR of -0.8 % to -30.0 %. The Budyko decomposition method applied over five year intervals captured the influence of forest treatment on streamflow well. However, the reference (WS-4) is changing in ways that climate alone cannot describe. Overall, it is important to consider how climate, land-use disturbance, and forest succession corroborate by distinguishing their respective impacts.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon is under threat through the joint effects of unsustainable regional development and climate change. Many studies in the past ten years have indicated that these can lead to deforestation, regional disturbance of temperatures and the water cycle, as well as loss of carbon stocks and biodiversity. In turn, these changes can lead to loss and dying of forests, droughts, low river levels and floods. If and when such degradation would occur, an Early Warning System (EWS) that would detect the imminent change would help to minimise its impacts. The EU-FP7 funded AMAZALERT project has investigated the likelihood and pathways of critical transitions in the Amazon and designed a blue-print for an EWS.\nThere is still much uncertainty on how robust the Amazon region is and how likely it is that it may collapse and ‘die-back’ within the foreseeable future. There is also uncertainty whether critical degradation would show any critical ‘tipping point’ behaviour, and whether such change would be associated with detectable early-warning signals, such as enhanced but slowing down variability in variables ahead of thresholds that are associated with the change. In the AMAZALERT project we performed a set of coherent climate, vegetation, hydrological, socio-economic and policy model evaluations to detect the sensitivities and potential critical change behaviour of the Amazon’s ecosystem services to climate and land-use change. We improved their parameterisation through field data analysis as well as through stakeholder interactions.\nA framework was designed to enable early warning and to assess implementation issues. A hierarchy of warning levels can be distinguished ranging from policy failure though fatal regional forcing conditions, to actual impact on ecosystems and ecosystem services. For each level, different sets of indicators can be identified and different observational and analysis tools are required. Model simulations of both low and high complexity show conflicting evidence whether indicators will be able to detect early warning signals in time. Since much of any critical change would occur through changes in the hydrological cycle, river levels, rainfall and soil moisture appear among the most important candidates for monitoring, along with biomass, carbon exchange and energy budgets.",

However, there is still lack of mechanistic understanding of the controls on tropical forest metabolism, particularly at individual tree level. In this study, we are interested in investigating (1) what is the seasonal pattern of woody growth for tropical trees and (2) what is the mechanistic controls onwoody growth at individual level?To explore the above questions,we use two data sources from an evergreen tropical forest KM67 site (near Santarem, Brazil). They are: (1) image time series from a tower mounted RGB imaging system, with images recordedin10 minutes interval since October 2013.Images near local noon homogeneous diffuse lighting were selectedfor leaf phenologymonitoring; (2) ground based bi-weekly biometry survey (via dendrometry band technique) for 25 trees from random sampling since September 2013. 12 among 25 trees are within the tower mounted camera image view. Our preliminary resultsdemonstrate that 20 trees among 25 trees surveyed significantly increase woody growth (or “green up”) in dry season. Our results also find thatamong those 20 trees, 12 trees reaches the maximum woody increment rate in late dry season with a mean DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) around 30 cm,while 8 trees reaching the maximum in the middle of wet season, with a mean DBH around 90 cm. This study,though limited in the sample size, mightprovide another line of evidence that Amazon rainforests “green up” in dry season. As for mechanistic controls on tropical tree woody control, we hypothesize both climate and leaf phenology control individual woody growth. We would like to link both camera based leaf phenology and climate data in the next to explorethe reason as to the pattern found in this study that bigger trees might have different seasonal growth pattern as smaller trees.",

            "abstract": "We are working towards a forward-model reconstruction of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) for the last millennium from the Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC) d18O record. QIC receives precipitation almost exclusively during the SASM season. Initial efforts focus on dynamics that yield precipitation at this receding tropical ice cap, and how they relate to the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes.\nWe present over a decade of daily snow-height change observations from the summit of QIC. Accumulation of snow (~2 m yr-1) at the summit occurs October through April, peaking in December. Net monthly snow-height change is negative May through September, though positive snow height change days do occur throughout the year.\nSnow height change time-series are used to develop d18O age-models for annual snow collected in vertical profiles near the summit of QIC since 2003. Snow d18O decreases during austral summer from about -17 to -24 per mil VSMOW. Post-depositional alteration of late summer snow during austral winter elevates d18O from about -24 to about -15 per mil VSMOW.\nTiming of 90thpercentile positive snow-height change events at QIC corresponds with regional precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies that are dynamically triggered by cold air incursions propagating from the midlatitudes east of the Andes into the Amazon Basin. Precipitation and OLR anomalies migrate northwest in about 2-3 days from near Rio de la Plata to central Peru. The convective anomalies are the result of southerly horizontal wind anomalies in the lower troposphere that advect cold extratropical air equatorward.\nComposite analysis of satellite measurements shows that cold air incursions are associated with negative water vapor dD (~ -40 per mil) anomalies at QIC. We expect that snow stable isotope values from QIC are thus not only records of the deep overturning component of the monsoon circulation but also of synoptic scale monsoon disturbances. Cold air incursions into the South American subtropics account for positive snow-height change anomalies and negative stable isotope anomalies at QIC.",

            "abstract": "To model quantitatively the response of Titan’s lakes and seas to Cassini’s RADAR instrument, and thus determine surface reflectivity, attenuation and penetration depth, it is necessary to constrain the dielectric properties of their liquids at ~14 GHz. Pre-Cassini estimates of methane loss tangents ranged from ~1.6 to 1.7 (real component) and ~10-5 to 10-3(imaginary components).\nWe present a new technique for measuring dielectric properties, used to measure the complex dielectric constant of relevant materials. A cylindrical cavity containing a cylindrical quartz tube, filled with pure methane or ethane situated along the cavity axis, was excited in TM0n0 modes, where the n= 2 mode had a resonant frequency of ~14 GHz at 90K. Calibration required measurement of cavity resonant frequency and quality factor for the empty cavity, the inserted empty tube, and the tube filled with a hydrocarbon liquid. These quantities were determined by fitting the measured amplitude versus frequency curve with a Lorentzian line shape.\nSeveral sets of measurements have been performed, giving complex dielectric constants (ε’ + ε” i) of 1.72 + 0.000049i for methane (tan δ = 2.8 x 10-5) and 2.00 + 0.000246i for ethane (tan δ = 1.23 x 10-4). Assuming that the dielectric properties of Ligeia Mare, as calculated by Mastrogiuseppe et al., are dominated by a nitrogen-saturated, binary methane-ethane mixture that obeys simple mixture modeling, our results are most consistent with pure methane-nitrogen. We can accommodate up to 13 vol% ethane, based on statistical uncertainties, or 19 vol% ethane, based on more conservative analytical uncertainties (incorporating uncertainties in measured quality factors, Lorentzian line shape fits, cavity radius, and quartz tube dimensions and calculated dielectric constant). All alternative compositions exhibit greater loss tangents, and so it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that methane is the dominant constituent of Ligeia Mare. We infer that ethane is either lost from or concentrated within Titan’s hydrocarbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are key elements of the landscape highly sensitive to the changes imposed by tectonics. In zones subject to tectonic forcing rivers steepen their gradients and in the case of a rapid increase in the rate of rock uplift, rivers form a knickpoint that propagates through the fluvial network conveying information of the new base­­–level. Here we exploited the use of the stream profile analysis to unravel the tectonic evolution of the Amatlán de Cañas half–graben (ACHG), a Pio-Quaternary extensional structure with ~1500 m of relief located in the northern sector of the Jalisco Block. We found that both the normalized channel steepness index (ksn) and relief are particularly high in the central part of the ACHG. We also identified two zones of high ksn values in several rivers where knickpoints are propagating. Our stream profile analysis indicates that the formation of the ACHG resulted from two rock uplift pulses. Projecting the longitudinal profile of reaches located upstream of knickpoints we estimate that the uplift in ACHG exceeded 0.5 km. Although the tectonic pulses built the relief of the ACHG, the incision of the Ameca River, which flows southeasterly, seems to be rejuvenating the relief as both the high ksn values and the distribution of knickpoints along the piedmont suggest.",

            "abstract": "Plant water uptake during summer is characterized by strong diurnal fluctuations. As a result a diurnal sink term is imposed on catchment storage, affecting the unsaturated zone, sometimes the saturated zone and even streamflow. Detecting this signal and understanding its propagation through the hydrological system may help to better quantify eco-hydrological connectivity.\nThe extent and strength of the propagation of this signal from plant to soil to ground- and streamwater was investigated with a unique setup of 46 field sites in Luxemburg and 15 field sites in Germany. These sites cover a range of geologies, soils, topographies and types of vegetation. Vegetation types include grassland, pine forest (young and old) and different deciduous forest stands. Available data at all sites includes information at high temporal resolution from 3-5 soil moisture profiles, matrix potential, piezometers and sapflow sensors (as proxy for plant water uptake) as well as standard climate data. At sites with access to a stream, discharge or water level is also recorded. Signal strength (amplitude of diurnal fluctuations) can thus be traced through the system and gives an indication of the physical sphere of influence of plant water uptake i.e. the “eco-hydro-connectivity”. The analysis of time lags (or phase shifts) between daily fluctuations in temperature, radiation, sapflow, soil water, groundwater and streamflow gives further insights into the processes driving and propagating these signals and inter-site comparison allows for the investigation of local controls.",

High spatial and temporal resolution measurements of water isotopes are necessary to follow the dynamics in rapidly changing systems and to map out the spatial heterogeneity of water circulation and mixing. Here we present results of the first commercially available Continuous Water Sampler Module (CoWS) that can be coupled to a Picarro L2130-i Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (CRDS) for real-time measurements of water isotopes. The CoWS is a compact and fully automated system with its core method modified from that of Munksgaard et al. (2011). Liquid water is continuously pumped into an extraction chamber, where water vapor diffuses through a micro-poruous polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane. The vapor is then carried by a dry carrier gas to the L2130-i for high precision measurements of δ18O and δD. The inlet water, carrier gas, and surface of the ePTFE membrane are actively temperature controlled to maintain a stable amount of fractionation of water isotopes across the membrane, which minimizes measurement drift\u0007\b. We have tested the CoWS-CRDS system with various inlet water types (tap water, deionized water, and seawater), and under operational conditions with variable ambient water and air temperatures. CoWS-CRDS has high precision \u0007(< 0.05 and < 0.15 ‰ 1σ, 5 minute average for δ18O and δD, respectively)\b and low drift water isotope measurements, with short response time (<5 minutes to eliminate 98% of the memory). The CoWS software is user configurable; allowing automated sampling among up to four water sources with user defined sampling durations. Additionally, we will present isotopic measurements with high-temporal resolution of an \u0007\bestuarine system where tidal changes affected the isotopic composition of the estuary.",

The reasons for this renewed growth are currently the subject of much debate. Here, we discuss the recent observed trends, and highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses in current “inverse” methods for quantifying fluxes using observations. In particular, we focus on the outstanding problems of accurately quantifying uncertainties in inverse frameworks. We examine to what extent the recent methane changes can be explained by the current generation of flux models and inventories. We examine the major modes of variability in wetland models along with the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). Using the Model for Ozone and Related Tracers (MOZART), we determine whether the spatial and temporal atmospheric trends predicted using these emissions can be brought into consistency with in situ atmospheric observations. We use a novel hierarchical Bayesian methodology in which scaling factors applied to the principal components of the flux fields are estimated simultaneously with the uncertainties associated with the a priori fluxes and with model representations of the observations. Using this method, we examine the predictive power of methane flux models for explaining recent fluctuations.",

For example, fresh and aged soot particles interact differently with incident solar radiation, resulting in different overall radiation budgets.

The Soot Aerosol Aging Study (SAAS) was conducted at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in November 2013 and January 2014 as a step towards understanding the evolution of mixing state of soot and its impact on climate-relevant properties. Aging experiments on diesel soot were carried out in a controlled laboratory chamber, and the effects of condensation and coagulation processes were systematically explored in separate sets of experiments. In addition to online measurement of aerosol properties, aerosol samples were collected for offline single particle analysis to investigate the evolution of the morphology, elemental composition and fine structure of sample particles from different experiments.\nCondensation experiments focused on the formation of α-pinene secondary organic aerosol on diesel soot aerosol seeds. Experiments were conducted to study the aging of soot under dry (RH < 2%) and humid conditions (RH ~ 80%). We present an analysis of the morphology of soot, its evolution, and its correlation with optical properties, as the condensation of α-pinene SOA is carried out for the two different RH conditions. The analysis was performed by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and atomic force microscopy for single particle characterization. In addition, particle size, mass, composition, shape, and density were characterized in-situ, as a function of organics condensed on soot seeds, using single particle mass spectrometer.",

Observations exhibit downward moving SADs intertwined with bright, upward moving spikes. Whereas SADs are dark voids, spikes are brighter, denser structures. Although SADs have been observed for decades, the mechanism for formation of SADs remains an open issue. Using high-Lundquist-number three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations, we demonstrate that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities develop in the downstream region of a reconnecting current sheet. The instability results in the formation of low-density coherent structures that resemble SADs, intertwined with high-density structures that appear to be spike-like. Using SDO/AIA images, we highlight features that have been previously unexplained, such as the splitting of SADs at their heads, but are a natural consequence of instabilities above the arcade. Comparison with siumlations suggest that secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in the exhaust of reconnecting current sheets provide a plausible mechanism for observed SADs and spikes. Although the plasma conditions are vastly different, analogous phenomena also occur in the Earth's magnetotail during reconnection.",

            "abstract": "Large volume pyroclastic silicic eruptions emit hundreds of megatons of SO2 into the troposphere and stratosphere that is oxidized into sulfuric acid (H2SO4) by a variety of reactions with mass independent oxygen signatures (MIF), Δ17O>0. Sulfuric acid is then preserved as gypsum in parental volcanic deposits. Diagenic effects are mass dependent and can dilute, but otherwise do not affect MIF ratios. Pleistocene Yellowstone and Bishop tuffs and modern volcanic eruptions preserved under arid climate conditions in North American playa lakes, preserve small amounts of volcanic sulfate as gypsum. This gypsum’s Δ17O>0, in combination with isotopic variations of δ18O, δ33S and δ34S is distinct from sedimentary sulfate and reveals its original MIF sulfate isotopic signal and the effect of super eruptions on the atmosphere, and ozone consumption in particular. We use linear algebraic equations to resolve volcanic versus sedimentary (MIF=0) sources. We have found that many large volume ignimbrites have very high initial Δ17O in volcanic sulfate that can only be acquired from reaction with stratospheric ozone.\nWe here investigate nine thick (>2 m) ash beds ranging in age from ~33-23 Ma in the John Day Formation of central Oregon, including massive 28.6 Ma Picture Gorge tuff of newly identified Crooked River supercaldera. The 28.6 Ma Picture Gorge tuff (PGT) has the highest measured Δ17O of 3.5‰, and other tuffs (Tin Roof, Biotite, Deep Creek) have +1.3 to 3.4‰ Δ17O excesses. Sulfate from modern smaller tropospheric eruptions studied for comparison have a resolvable 0.4‰ range consistent with liquid-phase based H2O2 oxidation. The PGT is coeval with the ignimbrite flare-up in western N. America, the 28-29 Ma eruption of the 5000 km3 Fish Canyon tuff and the 28 Ma Never Summer Field eruption in Nebraska-Colorado that have the highest measured Δ17O of 6‰ (Bao et al. 2003). We speculate on the climatic/atmospheric effects of these multiple ~28 Ma supereruptions in the N America semiarid paleoclimate. The strong mass independent signal of the 28-29 Ma ignimbrite flare-up suggests these super eruptions must have reached well into the stratosphere to record interactions with ozone and peroxide or created dry fog tropospheric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Aqueous fluids released from the down-going slab in subduction zones are generally thought to be the cause of arc volcanism. However there is a significant discrepancy between the consistent location of the volcanic front with respect to intermediate depth earthquakes (e.g. 100+/-40 km; England et al., GJI, 2004, Syracuse & Abers, G-cubed, 2006) and the large depth range over which dehydration reactions are predicted to occur in the slab (e.g. 80-250 km; van Keken et al., JGR, 2011).\nBy coupling the fluid flow to the solid rheology through compaction pressure, recent numerical models (Wilson et al., EPSL, 2014) demonstrated a number of focusing mechanisms that can be invoked to explain this apparent discrepancy. Most notable among these were permeability channels within the slab. These were shown to be highly effective in transporting fluid from deeper fluid sources along the slab towards the shallowest source. In the presence of these channels the majority of the fluid is released into the mantle wedge far shallower and closer to the arc than it was originally generated.\nWhile observations consistent with free fluids in the slab have been reported (e.g. Shiina et al., GRL, 2013), it is possible that changing the rheology and reactivity of the slab can change the efficiency of in-slab transport. We present a series of simplified model problems of fluid flow within the slab and mantle wedge demonstrating the potential effect of these processes on fluid flux. In particular, pseudo-1D models show that if fluids can efficiently rehydrate slab minerals, then these reactions can shut down fluid pathways within the slab, resulting in deeper release of fluid into the mantle wedge. However, the behavior in full subduction zone models remains to be determined.",

            "abstract": "Partially molten rocks commonly develop textures that appear close to textural equilibrium, where the melt network evolves to minimize the energy of the melt-solid interfaces, while maintaining the dihedral angle θ at solid-solid-melt contact lines. Textural equilibrium provides a powerful model for the melt distribution that controls the petro-physical properties of partially molten rocks, e.g., permeability, elastic moduli, and electrical resistivity.\n We present the first level-set computations of three-dimensional texturally equilibrated melt networks in rocks with an anisotropic fabric. Our results show that anisotropy induces wetting of smaller grain boundary faces for θ > 0 at realistic porosities ϕ < 3%. This was previously not thought to be possible at textural equilibrium and reconciles the theory with experimental observations. Wetting of the grain boundary faces leads to a dramatic redistribution of the melt from the edges to the faces that introduces strong anisotropy in the petro-physical properties such as permeability, effective electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Figure, on left, shows that smaller grain boundaries become wetted at relatively low melt fractions of 3% in stretched polyhedral grains with elongation factor 1.5. Right plot represents the ratio of melt electrical conductivity to effective conductivity of medium (known as formation factor) as an example of anisotropy in physical properties. The plot shows that even slight anisotropy in grains induces considerable anisotropy in electrical properties.",

Yet, far too often, the importance, meaning, and relevance of their discoveries are never shared with persons outside their discipline. Recognizing the need for scientists to communicate more effectively with the public, the Florida Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE Florida) saw an opportunity to connect the two through film. In the fall 2013, COSEE Florida launched the Ocean 180 Video Challenge to tap into the competitive spirit of scientists and inspire them to share their latest discoveries with the public. The competition encouraged scientists to submit short, 3-minute video abstracts summarizing the important findings of recent peer-reviewed papers and highlighting the relevance, meaning, and implications of the research to persons outside their discipline. Videos were initially screened and evaluated by a team of science and communication experts and the winners (from a field of ten finalists) were selected by more than 30,000 middle school students from 285 schools in 13 countries. Our presentation will review the outcomes and lessons learned from the 2014 competition and describe how contest videos are being used for professional development/training and educational purposes. We will also describe how video competitions can benefit both scientists and the target audience and be effective outreach strategies for encouraging scientists to share new discoveries and their enthusiasm for science with K-12 students and the public.",

            "abstract": "Presently there are no regional-scale morphometric analyses of Andean fluvial basins. Therefore, we created a continental-scale database of these basins. Our data covers over an area 1,000,000 km2 of the Andes, from Venezuela to Argentina. These basins are the source of some of the largest rivers in the world including the Amazon, Orinoco, Parana, and Magdalena. Morphometric parameters including shape factor, relief ratio, longitudinal profiles and different indices of basin elevation were calculated based on the CGIAR SRTM 4.1 DEM (~90 m resolution). FAO Hydrosheds were used to segment the DEM by major catchment and then manually cut at the Andean zone. In the North and Central Andes, this produced over 500,000 subcatchments, which we reduced to 619 by setting minimum catchment area to 100 km2. We then integrate lithologic data from DNPM geologic data. Our results indicate that sedimentary lithologies dominate Central Andean catchments (n=268,k=4), which cover an area 767,00 km2, while the Northern Andean catchments (covering 350,000 km2) are more varied, dominated by volcanics in the Pacific (n=78), a sedimentary (48%) dominant mix in the Caribbean (n=138) and 60% sedimentary in the Amazon-Orinoco subregion catchments (n=138). Elevation averages are smallest in the north Andes and average maximum elevations (6,026 m) in the Argentinian catchments (n=65) of the Central Andes are the highest. Shape factors range from 0.49 to 0.58 in the North and 0.52 to 0.58 in the Central Andes. There are clear differences in all categories between region and subregion, but that difference does not hinge on a single morphometric or geologic parameter. Morphometric parameters at a watershed scale (listed in Table) are analyzed and hydrologic data from gauging stations throughout the Andes (n=100) are used to compare morphometric parameters with lithology and characteristics from the basin hydrograph (peak discharge timing, minimum and maximum discharge, and runoff).",

            "abstract": "How do you teach volcanology and volcanic hazards to students when there is no volcano nearby? You bring the volcano to them! At Michigan Technological University we have developed a four-lesson-unit for middle and high school students which incorporates virtual, analogue and numerical models to increase students’ interests in geosciences while simultaneously expanding the community of earth-science-literate individuals necessary for a disaster resilient society. The unit aims to build on students’ prior geoscience knowledge by examining the physical properties that influence volcanic eruptions and introduces them to challenges and methods of communicating hazards and risk. Lesson one engages students in a series of hands-on investigations that explore the “3-Vs” of volcanology: Viscosity, Volatiles and Volume. The students learn about the relationship between magma composition and viscosity and the influence on eruption style, behavior and morphology of different volcanoes. Lesson two uses an analogue model of a volcano to demonstrate the forces involved in an explosive eruption and associated hazards. Students think critically about the factors that affect hazards and risk as well as the variables (such as topography) that affect the eruption and the hazard. During lesson three students use Google Earth for a virtual field trip to Pacaya volcano, Guatemala to examine changes in the landscape over time and other evidence of volcanic activity to make interpretations about the volcano. The final lesson has the students use numerical models and GIS to create hazard maps based on probabilistic lahar scenarios. Throughout the unit students are engaged in an inquiry-based exploration that covers several Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) content and practices. This four lesson unit has been field tested in two school districts and during a summer engineering program. Results from student work and post-surveys show that this strategy raises interests in and knowledge of volcanic hazards.",

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will be collecting data over the 30 years, using consistent, standardized methods across the United States. These freely available new data provide an opportunity for increased understanding of continental- and global scale processes such as changes in vegetation structure and condition, biodiversity and landuse.\nHowever, while “big data” are becoming more accessible and available, integrating big data into the university courses is challenging. New and potentially unfamiliar data types and associated processing methods, required to work with a growing diversity of available data, may warrant time and resources that present a barrier to classroom integration. Analysis of these big datasets may further present a challenge given large file sizes, and uncertainty regarding best methods to properly statistically summarize and analyze results. Finally, teaching resources, in the form of demonstrative illustrations, and other supporting media that might help teach key data concepts, take time to find and more time to develop. Available resources are often spread widely across multi-online spaces.\nThis presentation will overview the development of NEON’s collaborative University-focused online education portal. Portal content will include 1) videos and supporting graphics that explain key concepts related to NEON data products including collection methods, key metadata to consider and consideration of potential error and uncertainty surrounding data analysis; and 2) packaged “lab” activities that include supporting data to be used in an ecology, biology or earth science classroom.

            "abstract": "Naturally occurring production of molecular hydrogen (H2) by water radiolysis may be a fundamentally important source of electron donors (energy) for life in subsurface environments where organic matter is scarce. Previous studies with very high gamma radiation rates and wet mineral phases have reported high H2 production relative to production from water radiolysis in the absence of solid phases. Numerical calculations by other previous studies have predicted enhanced H2 production from seawater radiolysis relative to pure water radiolysis, due to the interaction of anions with hydroxyl radicals.\nGiven these reports, the potential catalytic influences of solid and dissolved chemical phases on radiolytic H2 production need to be carefully quantified in order to fully evaluate the role of radiolytic H2 as a microbial energy source.\nFor such quantification, we undertook gamma-irradiation experiments with pure water, deep ocean water and mixtures (slurries, φ = 0.85) of seawater with: North Pacific abyssal clay and calcareous oozes, coastal sediment, zirconium dioxide, and zeolite. We carried out our experiments at the Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center using a 37Cesium source at low dose rates (up to 0.1 Gy/hr).\nOur results to date include the following. First, the per-dose radiolytic H2 yield of pure water at low dose rates is directly comparable to the per-dose yield at much higher dose rates (ca. 1 kGy/hr); this result indicates that H2 production rate is linearly related to radiation dose rate across four orders of magnitude. Second, there is no statistically significant difference (90% confidence limit) between the radiolytic H2 yield from pure water and that from seawater; this result rules out influence of abundant seawater salts on H2 yield from water radiolysis. Third, H2 production from a mixture of abyssal clay and seawater is 25% higher than the yield from pure water. This enhanced yield is consistent with catalysis of radiolytic H2 production by zeolite.",

            "abstract": "Mounting evidence shows that California is currently experiencing the most severe drought since 1580, and it is likely that extreme droughts will become more common as the climate changes. Any drought – particularly one of this magnitude – can elevate dust transport, from fallow croplands and bare natural ecosystems, to sometimes distant locations. The transported dust may bring nutrients and microorganisms, with unknown, but potentially transformational, impacts on the ecosystems where dust is deposited. In this project, we are measuring the mass, provenance (using isotopic chemistry), chemical makeup, and microbial composition of dust transported to the Sierra Nevada mountain range.\nDust is being collected at three sites along an elevational gradient in the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (SSCZO), ranging from 400 m to 2000 m elevation. At each site, dust has been collected monthly in Summer 2014 from passive dust collectors and from filters (1 um pore size) on the eddy covariance tower active CO2 samplers. To complement dust collection, soil samples (10 cm depth) have been collected within the footprint of the towers. Dust fluxes were found to be highest at the 2000 meter-high site, with a maximum of 231 mg dust collected in July 2014. The lowest dust fluxes were found at the medium elevation site, at 1100 m, with 21 mg dust in July. The provenance of dust samples will be determined using radiogenic strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) isotopic tracers. Nutrients and microbial composition of dust and soil samples will also be analyzed. This approach will allow us to identify the effects of mega-droughts on i) dust-related contributions to the geobiology and biogeochemistry of soils and ecosystems, ii) the role of local versus distant dust sources of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea and fungi, and of nutrients to the Sierra Nevada, and iii) the role of elevation in determining the ecological effects of mega-drought-induced dust transport. In the future, we will endeavor to compare the data collected during this year of extreme drought to data collected in wetter years.",

            "abstract": "On June 1st 2014 (UTC), a M 3.2 earthquake occurred in Weld County, Colorado. Weld County is largely aseismic and this event was unexpected. There were no events in the ANSS Comprehensive Catalogue within 50 km of the earthquake. Weld County is the center of active oil and gas development, including many high-volume Class II wastewater injection wells. Injection wells have been linked to an increasing number of earthquakes throughout the US in recent years. Due to the lack of background seismicity in the area and the proximity of the earthquake to several injection wells, the University of Colorado requested seismometers from IRIS PASSCAL’s Rapid Array Mobilization Program in order to study further seismicity. Seismic stations were deployed within 3 days of the June 1st event.\nWe report on our ongoing findings from this deployment. To date, we have located 89 earthquakes and have detected over 600. These numbers continue to grow as we collect and analyze further data. Earthquake magnitudes remain small with only three earthquakes above M 2.0 recorded by our network, the largest of which was an M 2.6 earthquake on June 23rd 2014. Earthquakes locate in a small cluster (~2 km radius) centered near a high-volume injection well. This well operated at injection rates greater than 300,000 barrels/month since August 2013 and injects at a depth near the sediment-basement contact. Prior to our local deployment, the closest seismic station to the June 1st event was > 100 km away and therefore the evolution of seismicity prior the June 1st earthquake is poorly constrained. In order to better understand the temporal evolution of seismicity, we use match-filtering on data from these distant stations and find the earliest matching event on November 11th 2013. Due to the strong spatial and temporal correlation between these events and injection operations, we find it likely that these earthquakes are induced.\nIn response to the ongoing seismicity near the well, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) ordered the high-volume well shutdown for 20 days. The well has since restarted injection at lower rates, with the potential to increase injection rates over time. The shutdown and resumption of smaller injection volumes provides the unique opportunity to directly evaluate the seismicity’s relationship to well operations.",

            "abstract": "In the US Cordilleran hinterland, Paleogene terrestrial strata independently constrain relative topography and provide information on the local depositional environment and regional drainage morphology necessary for interpreting stable isotope paleoaltimetry data. Volcanic glass hydration waters from fluvially interbedded ignimbrites record increasing δD values eastward from the paleo-coast, indicating that the region maintained demonstrably higher than modern elevations (3.5 +.7/-.3 km) through the Paleogene. This orogen had a distinct crest and continuous westward-draining slope extending to central California. To the east of this crest, Eocene strata consist of basal fluvial gravel conglomerate ≤ 200 m thick, overlain by interbedded fine-grained lacustrine strata up to 1 km thick, which record hydrologic closure. Conglomerates and sandstones display structures indicative of deposition primarily in gravel-bed braided rivers. Overlying interbedded laminated marl, siltstone, and carbonaceous mudstone containing abundant fossil flora, gastropods, and ostracods indicate a deep freshwater lacustrine depositional environment. Up section, alternating laminated kerogen-rich marl and calcareous mudstone, mud-cracked siltstone, stromatolites, and an absence of bioturbation record anoxic, saline bottom waters and fluctuating profundal to evaporative conditions. Tephras interbedded with lake strata have highly enriched δD values due to hydration by evaporative lake waters, supporting the interpretations that depositional environment controls δD values and that fully hydrated glass resists alteration on geologic timescales. Eocene stratigraphy indicates increased accommodation, continental drainage ponding, and basin closure. It is unlikely that local geomorphic damming provided the regionally extensive driver to create these deep, high elevation closed basins. Instead, migrating regional construction of topographic barriers resulting from the onset of extension and/or broad dynamic and thermal uplift associated with Farallon slab rollback likely drove basin formation. Late Oligocene δD values from fluvially interbedded tephras suggest < 500-900 m of uplift following rollback, while stratigraphy indicates a coincident westward shift in the locus of deposition.",

            "abstract": "Land use distribution are usually obtained by automatic processing of satellite and airborne pictures. The complexity of the obtained patterns which are furthermore scale dependent is enhanced in urban environment. This scale dependency is even more visible in a rasterized representation where only a unique class is affected to each pixel. A parameter commonly analysed in urban hydrology is the coefficient of imperviousness, which reflects the proportion of rainfall that will be immediately active in the catchment response. This coefficient is strongly scale dependent with a rasterized representation. This complex behaviour is well grasped with the help of the scale invariant notion of fractal dimension which enables to quantify the space occupied by a geometrical set (here the impervious areas) not only at a single scale but across all scales. This fractal dimension is also compared to the ones computed on the representation of the catchments with the help of operational semi-distributed models. Fractal dimensions of the corresponding sewer systems are also computed and compared with values found in the literature for natural river networks.\nThis methodology is tested on 7 pilot sites of the European NWE Interreg IV RainGain project located in France, Belgium, Netherlands, United-Kingdom and Portugal. Results are compared between all the case study which exhibit different physical features (slope, level of urbanisation, population density...).",

            "abstract": "The chemical and isotopic composition of the Earth is rationally understood within the context of the chondritic reference frame, without recourse to hidden reservoirs, collision erosion, or strict interpretation of an enstatite chondrite model. Challenges to interpreting the array of recent and disparate chemical and isotopic observations from meteorites need to be understood as rich data harvests that inform us of the compositional heterogeneity in the early solar system. Our ability to resolve small, significant compositional differences between chondrite families provide critical insights into integrated compositional signatures at differing annuli distances from the Sun (i.e., 1-6 AU). Rigorous evaluation of chondritic models for planets requires treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties – to date these efforts are uncommonly practiced.\nPlanetary olivine to pyroxene ratio reflects fO2 and temperature potentials in the nebular, given possible ISM compositional conditions; thus this ratio is a non-unique parameter of terrestrial bodies. Consequently the Mg/Si value of a planet (ie., olivine to pyroxene ratio) is a free variable; there is no singular chondritic Mg/Si value. For the Earth, there is an absence of physical and chemical evidence requiring a major element, chemical distinction between the upper and lower mantle, within uncertainties. Early Earth differentiation likely occurred, but there is an absence of chemical and isotopic evidence of its imprint. Chondrites, peridotites, komatiites, and basalts (ancient and modern) reveal a coherent picture of a chondritic compositional Earth, with compositionally affinities to enstatite chondrites. At present results from geoneutrino studies non-uniquely support these conclusions. Future experiments can provide true transformative insights into the Earth’s thermal budget, define compositional BSE models, and will restrict discussions on Earth dynamics and its thermal evolution.",

An improved understanding of how ecosystems recover after fire is necessary so that land managers can plan for and mitigate the effects of these disturbances. Although several studies have attempted to link fire intensity with severity, direct links between spectral indices of severity and key physiological changes in vegetation are not well understood. We conducted an assessment of how two western conifer species respond to four fire radiative energy treatments, with spectra acquired pre- and up to a month post-burn. After transforming the spectral data into Landsat 8 equivalent reflectance, burn severity indices commonly used in the remote sensing community were compared to concurrent physiological measurements including gas exchange and photosynthetic rate. Preliminary results indicate significant relationships between several fire severity indices and physiological responses measured in the conifer seedlings.",

            "abstract": "Water availability often limits crop production, even in relatively humid climates, and crops vary in their water demand and water use efficiency. Crop production for biofuel (ethanol or biodiesel) offers an alternative to fossil energy sources but requires large amounts of land, and is therefore a more viable option if such crops could be produced on marginal lands that often have soils of poor water-holding capacity. The selection of an appropriate crop requires information on its water demand, water use efficiency, and drought tolerance, but such information is incompletely available for the suite of cellulosic biofuel crops currently under consideration. This study analyzed soil moisture profiles (time-domain reflectometry) to estimate evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of three leading candidate crops for cellulosic bioenergy production (switchgrass, Miscanthus, and maize) grown in a relatively humid climate (Midwestern United States) over four years (2010-13). These field observations of water use by these annual and perennial crops reveal their water use efficiency for biomass and biofuel production. Total growing season water use was remarkably consistent among crops and across years of varying soil water availability, including very favorable precipitation years as well as a drought year (2012). Water use efficiency was more variable and, for maize, depends on whether the maize serves for both grain and cellulosic biofuel production.",

            "abstract": "The Northeastern United States (NE) relies heavily on thermoelectric power plants (90% of total capacity) to provide electricity to more than 70 million people. This region’s power plants require consistent, large volumes of water at sufficiently cold temperatures to generate electricity efficiently, and withdraw approximately 10.5 trillion gallons of water annually. Previous findings indicate that assessments of future electricity pathways must account for water availability, water temperature and the changing climate, as changes in these conditions may limit operational efficiency in the future. To account for such electric system vulnerabilities, we have created a link between an electricity system capacity expansion model (ReEDS) and a hydrologic model that is coupled to a power plant simulation model (FrAMES-TP2M) that allows for a new approach to analyze electricity system development, performance, and environmental impacts. Together, these coupled tools allow us to estimate electricity development and operations in the context of a changing climate and impacts on the seasonal spatial and temporal variability of water resources, downstream thermal effluents that cause plant-to-plant interferences and harm aquatic habitat, economic costs of water conservation methods and associated carbon emissions. In this study, we test and compare a business-as-usual strategy with three alternative water management scenarios that include changes in cooling technologies and water sources utilized for the years 2014-2050. Results of these experiments can provide useful insight into the feasibility of the electricity expansion scenarios in terms of associated water use and thermal impacts, carbon emissions, the cost of generating electricity, and also highlight the importance of accounting for water resources in future power sector planning and performance assessments.",

            "abstract": "Headwater streams are known for playing a key role in sustaining hydrological connectivity between uplands, riparian areas and streams, and eventually structuring ecosystems up to the regional scale. In this context, connectivity stands out as a natural backbone onto which a multitude of heterogeneous sub-scale processes, functions or habitats map. However, hillslope connectivity to streams is modulated by riparian zones. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of connectivity between uplands and valley bottoms.\nHere, we present new work that shows how diatoms can be used to increase our understanding of hydrological (water sources and flowpaths) and ecological (dynamics of terrestrial diatoms) connectivity and functioning of watersheds. We examine hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) systems across nested catchments in the Attert River basin (Luxembourg). Our main objective is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of saturated areas, the onset/cessation of their connectedness, and eventually their contribution to the storm hydrographs via rapid flowpaths.\nOur results show that during storm events, terrestrial diatoms are systematically mobilized and flushed into the streams. Catchments exhibit specific diatom assemblages that are largely controlled by prevailing physiogeographic characteristics (e.g. geology, land cover, soil types, soil moisture, etc.) and that are different from the benthic and planktic diatom assemblages found in streamwater. Drift diatom assemblages in streamflow determined at the Attert basin outlet during storm hydrographs bear the distinct signatures of upstream catchments – eventually translating the onset and cessation of rapid flowpaths connectivity throughout the river network. The large heterogeneity in terrestrial diatom communities within the HRS continuum, their flushing to the stream, as well as the distinct diatom assemblages characterising catchments with specific physiographic characteristics demonstrate the potential for this microscopic biological tracer to address questions of hydrological connectivity.",

As recent studies highlight novel disturbance regimes resulting from pollution, invasive pests and climate change, there is a need to include these alterations in predictions of future forest function and structure. The Ecosystem Demography (ED) model is a mechanistic model of forest ecosystem dynamics in which individual-based forest dynamics can be efficiently implemented over regional to global scales due to advanced scaling methods. We utilize ED to characterize the sensitivity of potential vegetation structure and function to changes in rates of density independent mortality. Disturbance rate within ED can either be altered directly or through the development of sub-models. Disturbance sub-models in ED currently include fire, land use and hurricanes. We use a tiered approach to understand the sensitivity of North American ecosystems to changes in background density independent mortality. Our first analyses were conducted at half-degree spatial resolution with a constant rate of disturbance in space and time, which was altered between runs. Annual climate was held constant at the site level and the land use and fire sub-models were turned off. Results showed an ~ 30% increase in non-forest area across the US when disturbance rates were changed from 0.6% a year to 1.2% a year and a more than 3.5 fold increase in non-forest area when disturbance rates doubled again from 1.2% to 2.4%. Continued runs altered natural background disturbance rates with the existing fire and hurricane sub models turned on as well as historic and future land use. By quantify differences between model outputs that characterize ecosystem structure and function related to the carbon cycle across the US, we are identifying areas and characteristics that display higher sensitivities to change in disturbance rates.",

A number of studies have shown the human impact on oceanic Pb in many parts of the world ocean, but little Pb data has been available for the Southeast Pacific Ocean.\nIn this presentation, we will show the dissolved Pb (<0.2µm) results from the US GEOTRACES cruise in October – December 2013, which sailed from Manta, Ecuador, to Tahiti along around 12 degrees south. Dissolved Pb concentrations from all 36 surface stations and deep (>1000m) Pb profiles from 18 stations will be presented, and the results will be also compared to our unpublished data from the BiG RAPA cruise in 2010, whose cruise track from Arica, Peru, to Easter Island is slightly south of the US GEOTRACES cruise. The BiG RAPA data showed that dissolved Pb concentrations of the southeast Pacific Ocean are relatively low, varying in the range of 8-20 pmol/kg at the surface with a slight maximum (14-22 pmol/kg) at around 400m depth, and 2-10 pmol/kg in deep waters below 1000m depth. The Pb concentrations were found to be higher at a marginal station off Peru, reaching 45 pmol/kg at the surface and 65 pmol/kg in the subsurface maximum at 150m depth, and varying between 17 and 23 pmol/kg in deep waters.\nOur dataset, along with the results from the BiG RAPA cruise, will provide the first overview on the dissolved Pb distribution of the southeast Pacific Ocean, which will further our understanding on the human impact on the global ocean.",

            "abstract": "The ecosystem services (ES) approach is increasingly used in research and policy, with the Common International Framework on Ecosystem Services (CICES) “cascade” gaining traction as a framework for conceptualizing the production of ecosystem services by the natural environment, and then people consuming these services and obtaining benefits depending on their values. However, uptake of the ES concept on the ground by ecosystem managers, and understanding by everyday citizens, is still limited. One barrier is the challenge of providing tangible, examples of everyday benefits and values that people can readily connect with the biophysical structures and functions that underlie their provision.\nWinegrowing offers one promising case to illustrate the linkages all along the chain of production and consumption of ecosystem services. The sensitive winegrape has long been known for its properties of terroir, where the taste of wine reflects the environmental conditions of the place where it is grown, a feature valued by consumers. Here the CICES framework is illustrated with the case of winegrowing, demonstrating that the current linear model of natural production and human consumption of ES needs to be modified for this case because people influence each of the five stages by shaping and responding to their environment, producing a two-way interaction between people and the environment throughout.\nFor example, while natural drivers such as climate and soils are key to the provision of the service of winegrape yields, landowners modify the biophysical environment through site selection and growers modify plant ecophysiological function through farming practices such as pruning and irrigation in order to influence the final service. Similarly, winemakers’ expertise is needed to transform the service of winegrape yields into the product of wine that can be enjoyed and valued by consumers, whose preferences shape wine styles as well. This case illustrates how incorporating both natural and human factors all along the chain of production and consumption of ecosystem services can better represent the potential services provided, and highlights the need to identify relevant decisionmakers at each stage to better understand and manage ecosystem services under environmental change.",

            "abstract": "The search for life on Mars is a cornerstone of international solar system exploration. In 2018, the European Space agency will launch the ExoMars Rover to further this. The key science objectives of the ExoMars Rover are to: 1) search for signs of past and present life on Mars; 2) investigate the water/geochemical environment as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface; and 3) to characterise the surface environment. ExoMars will drill into the sub-surface to look for indicators of past life using a variety of complementary techniques, including assessment of morphology (potential fossil organisms), mineralogy (past environments) and a search for organic molecules and their chirality (biomarkers).\nThe choice of landing site is vital if the objectives are to be met. The landing site must: (i) be ancient (≥3.6 Ga); (ii) show abundant morphological and mineral evidence for long-term, or frequently reoccurring, aqueous activity; (iii) include numerous sedimentary outcrops that (iv) are distributed over the landing region (the typical Rover traverse range is a few km, but ellipse size is ~ 100 by 15 km). Various ‘engineering constraints’ also apply, including: (i) latitude limited to 5º S to 25º N; (ii) maximum altitude of the landing site 2 km below Mars’s datum; and (iii) few steep slopes within the ellipse.\nIn March 2014, the first ExoMars Landing Site Selection Workshop was held, during which about ten different landing sites were presented and discussed. At the end of the workshop a poll of the workshop participants highlighted four sites as highest priority: Mawrth Vallis, Oxia Planum, Oxia Palus and Hypanis Delta. Of these, our team led proposals for the Oxia Palus and Hypanis Delta sites. The Oxia Palus site has since been renamed “Aram Dorsum” – the name the IAU designated to the inverted channel system that is the most prominent feature of the site. This is inferred to be the remnants of a long-lived, widespread alluvial system that was buried and then recently exhumed. The Hypanis site contains layered terminal deposits from the Hypanis and Sabrina Valles and is inferred to be an ancient environment.\nSince the workshop, further mapping and geological studies of these sites have been performed. Here we describe the latest results for these two sites, and why they are appropriate for meeting ExoMars’ goals.",

            "abstract": "The Hydrostratigraphic Drilling Record Assessment (HyDRA) project is a three-year study to develop improved methods for building groundwater flow models from drillers’ logs. Lithologic logs recorded by water well drillers represent a voluminous source of information regarding hydrostratigraphy. However, developing quantitative models from drillers’ logs is challenging due to the idiosyncratic nature of each driller’s approach to describing sediments and lithologies as well as variability in the amount of care invested in the description process. This presentation uses three approaches to assess the consistency and utility of drillers’ logs from 250 wells in the vicinity of a continuously monitored “index” well in the High Plains Aquifer in Thomas County, Kansas. The first assessment procedure will examine logs from wells in the vicinity of the index well to determine whether they show evidence of lateral confinement of a region immediately surrounding the index well, as seems to be indicated by the index well hydrograph. The second will apply a cross-validation procedure to determine the degree of consistency among logs at different wells and identify logs that are most out of keeping with logs at nearby wells. The logs are cast in quantitative terms by first representing the sediment descriptions using 72 standardized lithology terms, further categorizing the standardized lithologies into five hydraulic property categories, and then computing the proportions of the hydraulic property categories over regular ten-foot-intervals in each well. The cross-validation procedure involves using a cross-entropy measure to compare the actual category proportions in each well to those interpolated from neighboring wells. Finally, results of a groundwater flow model using property fields developed from the drillers’ logs will be briefly discussed. Comparisons between observed and simulated water levels at the index well and other continuously and annually monitored wells in the area serve as a basis for assessing the utility of the drillers’ logs in development of groundwater flow models.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent entrainment-mixing processes, cloud microphysics and their interactions need to be parameterized in models of widely different scales, ranging from large-eddy simulation models to cloud-resolving models to regional and global climate models. This necessity ---- similar need for climate models with different resolutions ---- poses a great challenge because all of these processes tend to be scale-dependent in ambient clouds, a topic poorly understood and studied itself. This work aims to understand the scale-dependence of these processes/properties from both observational and theoretical perspectives, and to explore the potentials for developing scale-dependent parameterizations. We will examine the dependence of entrainment-mixing mechanisms and microphysical properties on the averaging scale in clouds using data collected during the RACORO and other field campaigns. A new measure is introduced to quantify the entrainment-mixing processes. The relationships between the entrainment-mixing measure and microphysical properties and their scale dependence will be examined as well. We will also seek to connect the observational phenomenology to the systems theory on droplet size distributions, to explore ways to parameterize the scale-dependence for models of various resolutions, and to test with atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "Isotope-based hydroclimate records from the mid-continental United States that span the late Holocene with sub-decadal resolution are rare. As a result, the relationship between temperature and hydroclimate for this region is not well constrained. Pollen-based temperature reconstructions from North America suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 650 to 1050 CE) was warmer than the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1550 to 1850 CE), but that both were cooler than the current warm period (CWP; last 100 years). It has further been suggested that much of the mid-continental US experienced drought during the MCA and pluvial conditions during the LIA. This is supported by modern correlations between seasonal temperatures and precipitation, which are anti-correlated for much of the Midwest; however, for portions of the continental core, which includes the study region, the opposite relationship exists between temperature and precipitation (i.e., warmer is wetter and colder is drier). Within the context of this and previous paleoclimate work in the Midwest, including at Pretty Lake, we present initial geochronology, sedimentology and oxygen isotopic results from a new 12 m composite core from Pretty Lake, a 25 m deep kettle lake in LaGrange County, northeastern Indiana. Here we focus on the last 2000 years of the 16,000-year record in order to explore hydroclimate variability in response to temperature anomalies during the MCA and LIA. Pretty Lake is well suited for this type of investigation because the closed surface hydrology of the lake basin renders it sensitive to evaporation. This is reflected in oxygen isotope (δ18O) measurements of surface waters from the lake, which show that it is approximately 4‰ higher than meteoric precipitation and the surface waters of nearby, hydrologically-open Martin Lake. High-resolution down core δ18O measurements, therefore hold tremendous potential for reconstructing regional hydroclimate during the last 2000 years, particularly when combined with isotopic records of local precipitation and modeling approaches.",

            "abstract": "The simulation of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) remains a significant challenge in climate models. The primary difficulty lies in relating MJO skill to parameterized physical processes - the main access point for model development. One theory of the MJO relies on scale-interactions from small to large scales. The expectation is that GCMs should reproduce the correct relationships at the smallest resolved scales and this will translate through increasing scales and lead to a skillful simulation of the MJO. So-called 'process-based' diagnostics have recently been applied to simple model fields in order to relate accurate simulation of the MJO to accurate, small-scale process-level relationships (Kim et al., 2014). In this presentation we will take this technique further to provide greater insight into how the underlying physical parameterizations in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) conspire to provide the process-level responses in the model, particularly as it relates to precipitation and humidity dependent processes. This provides the potential for a range of dependencies between parameterization tendencies and MJO skill. Furthermore, these dependencies are examined to quantify the effect of model biases. This entails performing the same process-level analysis on simply initialized and nudged CAM simulations that make use of YOTC analysis. These techniques enable diagnosis of the relationship between degrading model simulation (basic state and MJO) and changes in the parameterized response at the process level. In summary, this talk will show the most promising relationships between MJO simulation performance and the fidelity with which the parameterized physics produce observed process-scale relationships.",

            "abstract": "This study explores possibility for seamless seasonal to decadal prediction of surface air temperature (TAS), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) using decadal hindcast/prediction experiments of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Long-lead prediction skill is evaluated by computing the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and mean squared skill score (MSSS) of multi-model ensemble with respect to the observations and reanalysis data over the period of 1981-2012. The MSSS of global-mean TAS shows a prediction skill for a lead time of up to one year. This is much shorter than the one estimated from the ACC, indicating that the predicted global-mean TAS has a significant conditional bias. It is also found that prediction skill is highly sensitive to the season considered. The lowest prediction skill is found during the boreal winter when the long-term trend and inter-annual variability of TAS are not well reproduced especially over the Eurasian continent. This contrasts to the enhanced prediction skill over the oceans for a year. In most models, wintertime ENSO index is predictable at least one year in advance. Both PDO and AMO indices are also highly predictable on decadal time scales. Although their prediction skills vary in seasons, prediction lead time is still up to 6 years for PDO index and 9 years for AMO index in cold seasons. This result suggests that the two dominant low-frequency climate variabilities in the Northern Hemisphere are predictable on decadal time scales at least in their signs. With this finding, it is predicted by the CMIP5 decadal prediction experiments initialized in 2009 that the PDO and AMO will stay in their present phases for the next few years.",

            "abstract": "Research suggests that broad-scale increases in temperature facilitated an abrupt initiation of upper treeline advance beginning in the 1950s at climatic treelines throughout a large portion of the southern and central Rocky Mountains. Despite this regional trend, patterns of finer scale variability often imply the likely influence of both wind-snow interactions and temperature on driving regeneration dynamics in these climatically-sensitive ecotones. This is particularly true for mountain ranges subject to consistently strong winds, such as the Medicine Bow Mountains of southeast Wyoming. A rich history of treeline work exists for this area, yet questions remain regarding how influential wind and snowpack variability are in governing climate-vegetation interactions within upper treeline ecotones and whether this varies according to the level of wind exposure. Here we present a coupled examination using dendroecology and remote sensing to test the hypothesis that sufficient snow cover is required in order for the ecological manifestation of increasing temperatures to appear at upper treeline; namely treeline advance. We used dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of colonization on the two highest peaks in the range (Medicine Bow Peak Massif and Kannaday Peak). We sampled a total of six sites by placing nested-belt transects on two south-facing and one north-facing site for each peak. To gauge the influence of wind-snow interactions at each site, we analyzed remotely-sensed images. We selected three sets of LANDSAT images for each mountain peak based on years with maximum, minimum, and mean snowfall conditions to capture the entire range of variability. Results demonstrate that snow cover can be a critical modifier of treeline advance, especially on wind-exposed slopes and on mountain peaks with a relatively dry hydroclimatology, where a protective snow layer is only evident during high snow years. Overall, this research suggests that the role of wind-snow interactions in mediating upper treeline advance is contingent on local hydroclimatology and that future changes in these environments will most likely be driven by changes in both temperature and snowpack conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) completed its field recording phase last fall with over 96% data return. While 60% of the stations returned data 100% of the time, only 9 performed below 90% and one station had questionable timing. One station was vandalized, another stolen. One station continued recording after its solar panels were pierced by a bullet, while another two stations survived a wildfire and a blow-down, respectively. The blow-down was an extreme wind event that felled hundreds of thousands of trees around the station. SPREE stations recorded many hundreds of earthquakes. Two regional earthquakes and over 400 teleseismic earthquakes had magnitudes over 5.5 and three, smaller local earthquakes had magnitudes over 2.5.\nWe have calculated power spectral estimates between 0.1-1000 s period for the ~2.5-year lifespan of all 82 SPREE stations. Vertical channels performed quite well across the entire frequency range, falling well below the high noise model of Peterson (1993) and usually within 10-15 dB of nearby Transportable Array stations.\nSPREE stations' horizontal components suffer from long-period (> 30 s) noise. This noise is quietest at night and becomes up to 30 dB noisier during the day in the summer months. We explore possible causes of this variation, including thermal and atmospheric pressure effects. One possibility is that stations are insulated by snow during the winter, reducing temperature variations within the vault. Spring snowmelt creates instability at many of the SPREE stations, evidenced by frequent recenterings and enhanced long-period noise.\nFor all channels, power in the microseismic band (4-16 s) is strongest in the winter, corresponding to storm season in the Northern Hemisphere, and approximately 20 dB weaker during the summer. The power spectrum and temporal variation of microseismic energy is consistent across the entire SPREE array.",

            "abstract": "Light use efficiency (LUE) models are used to estimate gross and net primary production (GPP, NPP). Earlier approaches have used one or more of the following factors impacting LUE to model GPP: (i) light climate, (ii) temperature, (iii) water stress, and (iv) phenology. In this study we seek to incorporate all four inputs as scalars for up- or down-regulating LUE in a daily GPP model. Traditional methods using satellite data are limited by cloudy conditions and revisit times. They require the use of interpolation to achieve daily estimates of GPP. Some parameters can vary greatly within a few days (i.e. light climate, temperature) and thus, reduce the accuracy of interpolations between scenes. Alternatively, methods that can combine spatially interpolated gridded meteorological and satellite data for parameters that change over the course of days to weeks (i.e. phenology) provide the best opportunity for a continuous daily estimate of GPP. This study seeks to develop the framework for such a model. Three Nebraska AmeriFlux sites between 2001 and 2012 (maize: 26 field-years; soybean: 10 field-years) were used to develop and validate a daily GPP model based on ground measurements of incoming photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and leaf area index. This model was calibrated using eddy covariance data from 2001 to 2008 (RMSE = 2.2 g C m-2 d-1; MNB = 4.7%) and validated with 2009 to 2012 data (RMSE = 2.6 g C m-2 d-1; MNB = 1.7%). Modeled GPP was generally within 10% of measured growing season totals in each year from 2009 to 2012. Cumulatively, over the same four years, the sum of error and the sum of absolute error between the measured and modeled GPP, which provide measures of long-term bias, was ±5% and 2 to 9%, respectively, among the three sites. The inclusion of AmeriFlux cropland sites in Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota will support this approach and provide additional validation sites for a daily GPP model using gridded meteorological and remote sensing products.",

            "abstract": "The Hangay Mountains stand 1.5 - 2 km above adjacent lowlands and the timing and cause of their high elevation is debated. As part of a broad collaborative project, we synthesize several data sets that collectively suggest the Hangay increased in elevation during the mid-to-late Miocene, while topographic relief, one metric commonly associated with active mountain ranges, remained largely unchanged.\nThe topographic crest of the Hangay forms the drainage divide between the Selenga River and internal drainage of the Mongolian Depression of Lakes (MDL) and northern Gobi. Synthetic drainage divides for the Hangay were created by filtering digital topography in the spectral domain (50 – 200 km wavelengths) using a 2D-FFT function. The co-location of the synthetic and modern divides suggests that the Hangay divide is in a stable, equilibrium configuration. This assumption is corroborated by chi-maps of steady-state river channel elevations that exhibit nearly equal values across water divides. An exception to both of these metrics occurs in the northwest Hangay where the Bulnay fault crosses a low divide between the western Selenga basin and the MDL.\nRecent basalt vesicle paleoaltimetry results allow for ~1 km of surface uplift of the central Hangay in the past ~ 10 Ma. These same basalt flows in-filled late Miocene valleys cut into basement with a minimum of 800 m of local relief; similar to the amount of modern, post-glacial relief along the drainage divide. mtDNA analyses from > 250 combined Stone Loaches (Barbatula), Grayling (Thymallus), and Eurasian Dace (Leuciscus) samples from both sides of the continental drainage divide are supportive of Miocene surface uplift. Molecular genetic differences between the loach populations across the divide suggest that they separated from a common ancestor between 20 and 11 Ma. This date is consistent with the timing of surface uplift and valley incision preserved in the Miocene basalt flows. The dace and grayling populations on either side of the divide separated more recently, at ~ 2 Ma and < 1 Ma, respectively. We speculate that either (1) Quaternary climate change via glacial drainage reorganization or (2) drainage capture in response to slip along the Bulnay fault forced these more recent separations. These topo-genetic constrains are needed inputs for regional geodynamic models.",

            "abstract": "What is the role of ocean coupling in the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO)? Consensus thinking holds that the essential physics of the MJO involve interactions between convection, atmospheric wave dynamics, and boundary layer and free troposphere moisture. However, many modeling studies demonstrate improved MJO simulation when an atmosphere-only general circulation model (AGCM) is coupled to an ocean model, so feedbacks from the ocean are probably not negligible.\nAssessing the importance and processes of these feedbacks is challenging for at least two reasons. First, observations of the MJO only sample the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere system; there is no \"uncoupled\" MJO in nature. Second, the practice of analyzing the MJO in uncoupled and coupled GCMs (CGCMs) involves using imperfect tools to study the problem. Although MJO simulation is improving in many models, shortcomings remain in both AGCMs and CGCMs, making it difficult to determine if changes brought about through coupling reflect critical air-sea interactions or are simply part of the collective idiosyncracies of a given model.\nFor the atmosphere, ocean feedbacks from intraseasonal sea surface temperature (SST) variations are communicated through their effects on surface fluxes of heat and moisture. This presentation suggests a set of analysis tools for diagnosing the impact of an interactive ocean on surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, including their mean, variance, spectral characteristics, and phasing with respect to wind, SST, and MJO convection. The diagnostics are demonstrated with application to several CMIP5 models, and reveal a variety of responses to coupled ocean feedbacks.",

Topographic relieves on landscapes provide various hydroclimatic conditions to examine vegetation functions and its responses to climate variation and changes in a short distance. In this study, we investigate ecohydrologic processes on two slopes of contrasting orientation and soil conditions in a native vegetation catchment with mean annual precipitation of 716 mm in South Australia, using water and carbon stable isotopes.\nThroughfall, soil water, twig water, and groundwater stable isotopes were measured and integrated into an isotope incorporated soil-plant-atmosphere model to examine different plant water use patterns on two slopes with different environmental conditions. The focuses are on how ecosystems on the two slopes receive, store, and use soil moisture in different manners.\nOn these two slopes, trees are under different water stresses. Both leaf and soil 13C/12C ratio were measured for the two slopes to examine if δ13C can be used as an water stress indicator in this small catchment, and if the potential difference in δ13C can be observed in the soil organic matter. We monitored one-year leaf δ13C of two tree species, Eucalyptus leucoxylon and Acacia pycnantha. Our results indicate that leaf δ13C reflects different water stress conditions between slopes, seasons, and different locations on the slopes.",

This documentary was an independent effort supported entirely by a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign that ran from Nov - Dec, 2013. The campaign attracted over 200 donors and was ultimately successful in raising the funds necessary to bring the film crew on board. By involving so many people in the funding of the project, we attracted a core audience for the outreach efforts during the cruise. These efforts included daily posts on various social media sites, both personal and scientific, as well as exclusive “sneak peeks” of the film for the Kickstarter backers. In addition, live interactions from the cruise included an interview with public radio from the submersible, and a public seminar from the back deck of the ship. All of these efforts resulted in the development of an audience that remains engaged in the progress of the science and the film, long after the cruise has concluded.",

A promising way of benchmarking these geodynamic models is by reconciling them with the observed offshore sedimentary record. However, it is difficult to deconvolve the erosional response produced by changes in dynamic topography from other sources of landscape change because the erosional response is a convolution of dynamic topography changes, tectonic uplift/subsidence, flexural response to erosional unloading and depositional loading, rock properties, and climate. Herein, we present results from a new landscape evolution model that is capable of producing simulations that are required at the scale and resolution necessary to quantify the landscape response to various models of dynamic topographic change on the U.S. Atlantic passive margin in the presence of flexural unloading and loading due to erosion and deposition. We perform a sensitivity study on the effects of geodynamic modeling parameters including effective elastic thickness, climate and rock properties. We find that, while models of dynamic topography are difficult to discern from the available sedimentary record at the scale of the continent in part due to induced topologic (stream geometry) change, at the catchment scale deposition rates are vastly different through time with differing dynamic topography models. At this scale, all models show distinct peaks in deposition rates, and varying elastic thickness has a significant effect on altering the timing of peak deposition.",

            "abstract": "Lava flow morphology and texture can provide insight into rheological and other physical properties of the flow. Studies of terrestrial and extra-terrestrial lava flows rely heavily on remotely sensed observations. This research aims to quantify micromorphology and texture of a Holocene lava flow in the Cima volcanic field (eastern California) using digital elevation models and radar backscatter imagery. We are testing the hypothesis that spatial patterns in morphometry and backscatter roughness correspond with varying rheological conditions during emplacement. The site is ideally suited for morphological study owing to the youthfulness of the flow, as well as the lack of vegetation and minimal surface erosion resulting from the high desert climate. The studied lava flow spans approximately 2.5 km and exhibits well defined lobate forms and lava ropes with clear A’a’ to Pahoehoe transitions. This study assesses lava flow micromorphology using a very high resolution (5 cm pixel) digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM was constructed from low-altitude aerial photos acquired using a remotely-controlled model aircraft. In addition to the DEM, the resulting orthoimagery provided a basis for distinguishing pristine lava flow surfaces from areas covered by vegetation and/or eolian deposits. Longer-wavelength morphology (spatial scales greater than 1 meter) is analyzed using a 50 cm pixel DEM produced using stereoscopic NAPP aerial photographs. Roughness estimates are compared with radar backscatter images including steeply incident C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) and L-band (24 cm wavelength) satellite data, as well as shallow incidence Ku-band data (1.7 cm wavelength) acquired using a ground-based imaging radar from an adjacent cinder cone. Photogrammetry and radar provide complementary information on lava flow morphology and micromorphological roughness, which are assessed at different spatial scales using general statistics, as well as the local hypsometric integral.",

We measured DOM concentrations (mg C/L) and optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) of these sources following biological and photochemical degradation over a three month period. DOM concentration decreased by over 90% in plant and algal leachates following 3 months of biodegradation, while photoexposure had negligible effects. The fluorescence index (FI), humic index (HI), specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA), and carbon-normalized fluorescence of Peaks C and A increased with biodegradation, whereas Peak T decreased. Photoexposure resulted in a decrease of the FI, HI and SUVA values. Our results emphasize the need to better understand how environmental processing affects DOM properties in aquatic environments; the frequently opposing effects of biodegradation and photodegradation, which occur simultaneously in nature, make it challenging to decipher the original DOM source without considering multiple parameters. This dataset can help us better identify which optical properties, either individual or in combination, can provide insight into how biogeochemical processes affect DOM in aquatic environments.",

            "abstract": "Turbidite paleoseismology requires careful consideration of site context, temporal interval of interest, sediment supply, and the flow dynamics before interpretations can be drawn. These factors are predicated on precise navigation so that the context of the core within modern bathymetric, sub-bottom, sidescan, and backscatter data are known. In Cascadia, numerous channel systems exist and cover a range of time intervals since the Early Pleistocene. During high stands, many of these systems are relict, with limited terrigenous sediment supply. Holocene paleoseismic records may depend on recycled materials from failure of local slopes to supply channels, slope basins, or fans. Local failures may serve to supply sediment at any point along a canyon system under expected shaking levels of ~ 1.0 g with or without recent sediment recharge. Recharge by active terrigenous sedimentation is apparently not required in Cascadia or Sumatra, where site locations, without this recharge possibility have excellent records correlable to other paleoseismic sites. By comparison to Pleistocene fan-building currents, Holocene currents are weak, rendering most areas of fan systems inactive. Core and backscatter data show the Astoria and Nitinat Fans have little Holocene activity outside the main channels. Pleistocene channels are crosscut by active Holocene incisions and levees, restricting their role as depocenters. In the main channels, the most recent currents are largely confined closely within their levees. Recent proposals for alternate Holocene pathways in Cascadia attempt to integrate data from inactive fans, pose implausible pathways over the top of the growing accretionary wedge, or use other inactive channels. Resolution of observations is also critical and simple visual core logging is inadequate when compared to modern CT data. Thus for Holocene paleoseismology, cores must be collected from within main channels or near enough to local slopes (1-2 km) to receive unchannelized sediment flows. High resolution core, site, and regional geophysical data are required. This appears to hold true for both Sumatra and Cascadia. The outcome of paleoseismic investigations depends critically on these considerations, and collecting numerous cores to test these sensitivities is highly desirable.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic carbon dioxide dissolving into the world’s oceans is causing a profound and rapid shift in ocean chemistry referred to as ocean acidification (OA) that causes carbonate structures to dissolve more readily in seawater with negative effects for organisms relying on calcified skeletons or shells (e.g. corals, mollusks, coralline algae). Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are ubiquitous and essential on coral reefs, providing both ecological and structural benefits to the reefs. However, CCA are adversely affected by low pH water, with severe reductions in recruitment, survival, growth and productivity.\nThe ability of different species of CCA to adapt to low pH waters was tested using a system of natural submarine springs (called “ojos”) near Puerto Morelos on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. These ojos continuously discharge groundwater that is close to seawater salinity but more acidic (pH 6.70-7.30) and under saturated (0.3 Ω to 0.97 Ω) than the ambient seawater (pH 8.03, 3.60 Ω ). Both corals and coralline algae grow in the water from these springs, suggesting that some calcifying species differ in their tolerance to low pH waters. Corallines were sampled along a pH gradient at five springs in December 2013 using underwater transects. Differences in percent cover, species abundance and diversity of CCA by pH levels will be discussed.\nThis work utilizes a unique natural laboratory for studying properties of calcifying biota along pH gradients and provides insight into the ability of CCA to tolerate or adapt to future conditions.",

            "abstract": "Climatic evolution and its effect on ecosystem stability through macronutrient acquisition is of particular interest in the fringe ecosystems of the Arctic and Sub-Arctic, regions predicted to face the most extreme temperature increases in Earth’s changing climate. Accordingly enhanced understanding of climate change impacts on nutrient mobilization in recently glaciated terrains will factor importantly into accurate predictive models for future ecosystem health. Lithologic variation can lead to differences in geomorphic processes and thus influence landscape evolution [1]. Heath ecosystems in the region are developed on thin soils which place them close to parent material bedrock. Given the abundance of thin soils mantling bedrock, we assessed how bedrock geochemical content links with foliar composition of key macronutrients. We focused our studies on four sites near Abisko, Sweden (68°21’N 19°02’E) in metamorphosed sedimentary bedrock. In our sites the average annual air temperature has crossed the 0o threshold and has been linked to many cryospheric and ecological impacts [2]. Sites were chosen at the same elevation (700 m absl) and shared similar vegetation coverage. Three dominant species across our sampling sites include Betula nana, Empetrum nigrum, and Salix lapponum. E. Nigrum had consistent concentrations of foliar magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P) across the bedrock compositional gradients. B. nana and S. lapponum had consistently higher foliar Mg and P concentrations than E. nigrum across the gradients. Across a soil calcium (Ca) gradient, dominant species had a weak correlation between soil Ca and foliar Ca contents, R2 = 0.106. Soil Mg and P gradients were similarly poorly correlated with foliar abundances, R2 = -0.0228, and R2= -0.034 respectively. Expansion of our work into other lithologies will contribute towards improved predictive biogeochemical models of macronutrient acquisition and ecological evolution across changing Arctic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "A hallmark of science in the Anthropocene is the increasing use of synthesis efforts to distill ever-growing data into the best available scientific knowledge. Thousands of scientists contribute substantial amounts of time towards these efforts, with the aim of producing authoritative work as a basis for informing both further research priorities and policy decisions. Organizations such as the IPCC are increasing their efforts to disseminate their scientific findings to broader audiences, for example, using text and video summaries targeted for policymakers. However, the results of such synthesis efforts have rarely been disseminated further back in the pipeline, in the classrooms where scientific literacy is shaped.\nHere, I will describe an emerging initiative to develop a program to translate state-of-the-art scientific synthesis findings into a modular, flexible climate change curriculum. This initiative is envisioned to compliment rather than compete with existing curriculum development efforts. Examples from innovation labs in healthcare delivery and other fields will be used to demonstrate a model for how a small, interdisciplinary team of early-career experts can use their content and pedagogical knowledge to transform synthesis results into ready-to-use teaching materials. The benefits of such a curriculum include improved student learning through constructive alignment of thoughtfully designed teaching and learning activities and assessment activities to promote intended learning outcomes, as well as the real-world illustration of the method of scientific inquiry applied to socially relevant problems. The curriculum can also improve teaching experiences through increased efficiency in course preparation, and in sharing best practices with participating colleagues. Initial scoping will examine the needs of university teachers of climate change courses as the constituents of this curriculum, and possible support models to mainstream such efforts. Ultimately, using scientific syntheses as the basis for university curricula would help close the gap between research and classroom learning, promote increased scientific understanding, and help ensure that the resources devoted to scientific synthesis efforts are translated to broader benefits for society.",

            "abstract": "River-borne inputs of alkalinity influence the pH and pCO2 of coastal ocean waters, and changes in alkalinity inputs also have implications for responses to climate-driven ocean acidification. Recent work has shown that alkalinity fluxes from rivers are not always dominated by inorganic carbon species, and can instead be composed somewhat or mostly of non-carbonate, presumably organic species. Concentrations and proportions of organic alkalinity (O-Alk) are correlated to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes, which are predicted to rise as Arctic permafrost thaws and the hydrologic cycle intensifies. We have scaled results from watershed studies to develop a process-based model to simulate and aggregate Arctic river exports of total alkalinity, DOC, and O-Alk to the coastal sea. Total alkalinity, DOC, and O-Alk were loaded to a river network and routed through a 6-minute hydrologic model (FrAMES). We present results contrasting poorly buffered (e.g. the Kolyma river) and highly buffered (e.g. the Yukon river) systems, the impact of O-Alk on river pH and pCO2, and examine the seasonalities of inorganic and organic influences on coastal ocean carbonate chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Klyuchevskoy volcano is the highest active volcano in Europe and Asia (~4800 m). Morphologically it is a classic stratovolcano, but its edifice consists entirely of mafic rocks (up to 55% of SiO2). The absence of andesites and dacites suggests that Klyuchevskoy does not have a crustal magma chamber. This is supported by seismological studies, the results of which have shown that stable crustal structures (magma bodies) are not found. However, [2] petrological barometry, indicates the existence of a magma chamber near the base of the crust beneath Klyuchevskoy at pressures of 5 – 9 kbar, (~ 18-33 km). In later studies, [1] and [4] proposed a model of decompression crystallization during continuous magma ascent in the conduit (from 50-60 km depth to the surface), which explains the genesis of the whole variety of Klyuchevskoy mafic rocks without the magma chamber requirement. The most recent detailed seismological studies combined with petrological barometry [3] suggest the existence of a sub-crustal volume (magma chamber) beneath Klyuchevskoy volcano (25-35 km depths) where processes of magma accumulation most likely occur.\nIn this study we attempt to confirm the presence of a sub-crustal magma chamber using Ni zonation in primitive olivines, which may preserve information about mixing between distinct primitive melts in the magma chamber. Moreover, olivine Ni diffusion rates could help to estimate the rate of magma ascent (from the 35 km depths to the surface) beneath Klyuchevskoy using the approach of [5]. Ni concentration in olivines were measured by the electron microprobe high-precision technique (20kV, 300 nA) developed in [6].\n[1] Ariskin et al.

Each module includes a variety of learning activities that allow students to explore the Earth’s complex and dynamic climate history. The most recent module, Climate Detectives, uses data from IODP Expedition 341, which traveled to the Gulf of Alaska during the summer of 2013 to study past climate, sedimentation, and tectonics along the continental margin. At the onset of Climate Detectives, students are presented with a challenge engaging them to investigate how the Earth's climate has changed since the Miocene in southern Alaska. To complete this challenge, students join Exp. 341 to collect and examine sediments collected from beneath the seafloor. The two-week module consists of six labs that provide students with the content and skills needed to solve this climate mystery. Students discover how an international team collaborates to examine a scientific problem with the IODP, compete in an engineering design challenge to learn about scientific ocean drilling, and learn about how different types of proxy data are used to detect changes in Earth's climate.\nThe NGSS Science and Engineering Practices are woven into the culminating activity, giving students the opportunity to think and act like scientists as they investigate the following questions: 1) How have environmental conditions in in the Gulf of Alaska changed during the time when the sediments in core U1417 were deposited? (2) What does the occurrence of different types of diatoms and their abundance reveal about the timing of the cycles of glacial advance and retreat? (3) What timeline is represented by the section of core? (4) How do results from the Gulf of Alaska compare with the global record of glaciations during this period based on oxygen isotopes proxies? Developed by educators in collaboration with Expedition 341 scientists, Climate Detectives is a strong example of how learners can engage in authentic research experiences using real data in the secondary science classroom. In this session you will receive a brief overview of the EarthLabs project, learn more about IODP Expedition 341, and see some of the resources that the module makes available to students to help them analyze the data.",

The Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) was established in 2009 to bring together the global scientific community to work towards a set of best practices and recommendations for using earth observation data to map, monitor and report on agricultural productivity globally across an array of diverse agricultural systems. These methods form the research and development component of the Group on Earth Observation Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative to harmonize global monitoring efforts and increase market transparency. The JECAM initiative brings together researchers from a large number of globally distributed, well monitored agricultural test sites that cover a range of crop types, cropping systems and climate regimes. Each test site works independently as well as together across multiple sites to test methods, sensors and field data collection techniques to derive key agricultural parameters, including crop type, crop condition, crop yield and soil moisture. The outcome of this project will be a set of best practices that cover the range of remote sensing monitoring and reporting needs, including satellite data acquisition, pre-processing techniques, information retrieval and ground data validation. These outcomes provide the research and development foundation for GEOGLAM and will help to inform the development of the GEOGLAM “system of systems” for global agricultural monitoring. The outcomes of the 2014 JECAM science meeting will be discussed as well as examples of methods being developed by JECAM scientists.",

            "abstract": "Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle by agricultural activities has provided nutritious food to society, but also poses increasing threats to human and ecosystem health through unintended pollution. Managing nitrogen more efficiently in crop production is critical for addressing both food security and environmental challenges.\nTechnologies and management practices have been developed to increase the uptake of applied nitrogen by crops. However, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, yield per unit nitrogen input) is also affected by social and economic factors. For example, to maximize profit, farmers may change crop choice or their nitrogen application rate, both of which lead to a change in NUE. To evaluate such impacts, we use both theoretical and empirical approaches on micro (farm) and macro (national) scales:\n1) We developed a bio-economic model (NUE3) on a farm scale to investigate how market signals (e.g. fertilizer and crop prices), government policies, and nitrogen-efficient technologies affect NUE. We demonstrate that if factors that influence nitrogen inputs (e.g. fertilizer-to-crop price ratios) are not considered, NUE projections will be poorly constrained. The impact of nitrogen-efficient technologies on NUE not only depends on how technology changes the production function, but also relies on the prices of the technologies, fertilizers, and crops.\n2) We constructed a database of the nitrogen budget in crop production for major crops and major crop producing countries from 1961 to 2010. Using this database, we investigate historical trends of NUE and its relationship to agronomic, economic, social, and policy factors. We find that NUE in most developed countries follows a “U-shape” relationship with income level, consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory. According to the dynamics revealed in the NUE3 model, we propose three major pathways by which economic development affects NUE, namely consumption, technology, and public policy.\nOverall, our research suggests that it is critical to include social and economic processes when studying perturbations of the global nitrogen cycle and crafting environmental and food security policy. Better collaboration across disciplines is essential to improve nitrogen management in the anthropocene.",

The idea is to work with local teachers to identify highly motivated and engaged students who want to learn more about science research and the people who do it. An intensive one day program was put together at multiple sites with an opportunity for the students and teachers who attended to connect virtually to discuss their research results, and get a report from the winterovers at the South Pole. In the spring of 2014, the IceCube Collaboration held its first masterclass with approximately 100 students in total at 5 sites---Universität Mainz (Germany), University of Delaware in Newark (US), Université Libre de Bruxelles and Vrije Universiteit Brussels (Belgium), and the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (US). The students looked through IceCube data and performed analyses that led to the first evidence for high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A description of the resources developed for the class, tactics used to recruit students and teachers, and the evaluation of the first course will be presented. The structure of the day can be readily generalized for other topics and disciplines.",

            "abstract": "The properties of solar energetic particles (SEPs) have long been modeled to constrain the proposed scenarios for particle acceleration. The challenge, however, is that the signatures of acceleration gleaned from SEP observations are modified as a consequence of transport within interplanetary space. During transport, an interesting subject in its own right, solar energetic particles are subject to pitch angle scattering by the turbulent magnetic field, adiabatic focusing, and/or reflections at large-scale magnetic structures. The highest energy anisotropic SEPs, so- called Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs), provide an ideal way to study acceleration with minimal complications from transport. The different morphologies of anisotropic GLEs and SEPs measured in space at lower energies has led many to believe that two distinct acceleration processes are at work. The unique observations from the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) instrument, provide an essential link between the highest energy GLEs and the low-energy in-situ observations. PAMELA observations bridge a critical gap in energy while also providing unique pitch angle measurements above several GeV making it possible for the first time to constrain the effects of transport over a broad range in energy. In this work, we present unique high-energy SEP observations from PAMELA of the 2012 May 17 GLE and interpret the observed pitch angle distributions as a function of energy as a result of local (1 AU) scattering.

            "abstract": "The giant >2800 km3 Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) and its post-caldera, crystal-rich rhyolitic lava domes share identical compositions (69-76 wt. % SiO2), mineralogies, mineral textures, and zircon and allanite U-Th ages (Barbee et al., 2014). To further understand the genetic relation between the YTT and the domes, we conducted an extensive in-situ cathodoluminescence (CL) study on serial slices of their unusual ≤2 cm, euhedral quartz crystals. Several important magma processes are recorded by CL zoning of Toba quartz, including (1) episodes of undercooling and irregular crystal growth (skeletal and dendritic zones, melt entrapment, growth embayments), (2) crystal dissolution (rounded cores and truncated zones), (3) quartz clustering (synneusis, parallel growth or twinning), and (4) fluctuating magma conditions and dynamics (contrasts in CL intensity). The associated features (1–3) are defined by growth zone configurations, whereas distinct cores, mantles, rims, and oscillatory zones mainly represent differences in trace element concentrations (4). Nearly all magma compositions are dominated by quartz with continuous subtle core to rim oscillatory zoning, while mid- to lower-SiO2 samples contain the largest proportion of crystals with bright interior and rim zones consistent with crystal settling into a high-T environment or injection of hotter magma. The diversity of near-rim zoning patterns and CL boundary sharpness in single samples indicates coalescence of quartz with dissimilar, late-stage histories; however, interior zoning patterns broadly correlate with low- and high-SiO2 bulk magma compositions similarly for the YTT and lava domes. Although a second generation of quartz crystallization is apparent in the groundmass of the lavas, its occurrence is not visually evident on the majority of dome (or recycled-YTT) phenocrysts. Processes promoting cluster formation appear important for quartz growth at Toba and may be related to those responsible in plutonic systems (Beane and Wiebe, 2012). The complex but comparable quartz growth histories and composite crystal forms between the YTT and domes suggest they experienced similar conditions during quartz crystallization and may share a common ancestry.",

Topographic mapping will be a key component of JUICE orbital and Clipper flyby mapping and an understanding of Ganymede topography can also help guide instrument development. Topographic data for Ganymede are based almost entirely on Voyager and Galileo image analysis and are sparse. No more than 20% of the surface (which exceeds that of Mercury in area in total) is presently mappable. Both stereo (3D) and shape-from-shading (PC) are both possible (and nearly all possible DEM combinations have now been constructed). Unlike Europa, only an handful of sites are mappable using both techniques: these being mostly over the South Polar region with Voyager 2. Without stereo control, PC topography, while very useful, must be interpreted with caution. Only a handful of targeted stereo mosaics were possible from Galileo, but serendipitous Voyager-Galileo stereo greatly expands this data set. Topographic data allow determinations of RMS slope values for each terrain type, but currently only at length scales >100 m. Topographic amplitude can also be determined. Geologic units for which we have limited DEM data include: furrows, grooves, smooth and subdued grooved terrains, calderas, pit and dome craters, penepalimpsests, and palimpsests. Key science questions that can be guided by even the limited available topography include: relative elevations of smooth, grooved and dark terrains and the role of volcanic vs. tectonic resurfacing; relief of ancient degraded impact craters and the role of density and heat variations; density anomalies within or beneath the ice shell; the severity and history of thermal relaxation globally and the associated heat pulse. Here we focus on the issue of relaxation, where topographic evidence indicates that thermal relaxation reached a peak associated with bright terrain formation, reducing topography of earlier craters, furrows and all other features equally, and then decayed quickly, leaving more recently formed features mostly intact. Regional variations in heat flux may be evident in the distribution of relaxed craters, especially at the South Pole.",

            "abstract": "Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is the artificial recharge and temporary storage of water in an aquifer when water is abundant, and recovery of all or a portion of that water when it is needed. In recent years, interest in ASR has increased due to various concerns such as declining groundwater resources, vulnerability of surface water supplies to contamination and reservoir sedimentation, and unfavorable projections of future climate change. In this study, we evaluate a new recharge method for ASR in near-surface unconsolidated aquifers using small-diameter, low-cost wells installed with direct-push (DP) technology. The effectiveness of a DP well for ASR was compared with a surface infiltration basin at a field site in the Lower Republic River basin, north-central Kansas. Initial DP-based characterization of the shallow, unconsolidated subsurface indicates that both the vadose and saturated zones have many low permeability silt and clay layers constraining vertical flow. The performance of the surface basin as a recharge approach was poor at the test site due to the presence of a continuous clay layer at a depth of 1.5 to 3 m, which prevented the downward movement of infiltrated water and significantly reduced the recharge capacity of the basin. The DP well, on the other hand, penetrated through this clay layer and was able to recharge water at a much higher rate without use of a pump (water moved by gravity alone). Most importantly, the costs of the DP well, including both the construction and land costs, were only a small fraction of those for the infiltration basin. The low cost of DP wells can significantly expand the applicability of ASR as a water resources management tool to regions with limited resources, such as many small municipalities and rural communities. Our field results have clearly demonstrated the great potential of DP wells as a new recharge option for ASR projects in near-surface unconsolidated aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Sierra Negra is a basaltic shield volcano located at the southern end of Isabela Island, Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. The volcano, along with the rest of the Galápagos Islands, has formed by hotspot volcanism. The volcano has erupted twice over the last 35 years, producing VEI-3 eruptions in November 1979 and October 2005. Previous studies suggest that deformation is due to a flat-topped chamber or sill centered 1.9-2.2 km beneath the caldera (Amelung et al. 2000; Yun et al. 2006; Geist et al. 2007). Ten continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) stations were installed within and on the rim of the caldera of Sierra Negra (i.e., sites GV01 - GV10) in 2002, 2006, and 2009 to track ongoing deformation. In addition, there is one cGPS site on the nearby (90 km) island of Santa Cruz (GLPS), where no recent volcanism has been observed. We analyzed the cGPS data for the period 2008 to 2014 using GIPSY-OASIS II and produced daily position time series for each site. We then estimated yearly velocities for each site assuming linear deformation. We subtract the velocity vector for site GLPS from all Sierra Negra cGPS sites to remove the motion of the Nazca plate. The resulting horizontal and vertical velocity fields indicate significant upward and outward displacement of the volcanic edifice, which we interpret as caused by the influx of new magma or magma chamber pressurization. There are significant yearly variations in both the direction and magnitude of station velocities. For the period covering 2008 to 2011 there is accelerating inflation. Maximum rates of deformation (mm/yr) are seen at GV07 in 2008 (87.02), GV09 in 2009 (161.18), and GV03 in 2010 (191.03). Inflation continues for the period 2011-2013, but at a slower rate. Maximum rates are seen at GV03 in 2011 (78.53) and GV06 in 2012 (22.44). The rate then increases again for the period covering mid-2013 through early 2014. Maximum rates are seen at GV06 in both 2013 (318.27) and early 2014 (308.53). The maximum vertical uplift rates (564.92) are seen at the sites closest to the center of the caldera, GV02 and GV04. A preliminary model for the influx of magma into the system during 2013 suggests 0.015 km3 and a source depth of 2.2 km.",

            "abstract": "Cave records from the Southwestern US reveal a rich history of hydroclimate variability. In southeastern Arizona, we have developed a set of isotopic reconstructions of paleoclimate that include high-resolution records from several key intervals spanning the last glacial cycle (129 kyr BP to present). From monitoring studies in several caves, we infer that a significant control on the oxygen isotope content of dripwater is the balance between summer and winter precipitation. This balance varies among caves, and the response time is different between drips within caves. Speleothem records from both the Holocene (4 overlapping datasets) and the last interglacial (2 non-overlapping) show relatively high oxygen isotope values that most likely reflect a stronger monsoon directly forced by high summer insolation. This inference is consistent with other paleoclimate datasets and with forced model simulations of past intervals. We also observe elevated oxygen isotope values that approach Holocene levels around 14 and 52 kyr BP, which can only partly be linked to insolation forcing but are consistent with some other datasets. All records show substantial decade-century scale variability exceeding that of the past century; this variability can partially be correlated among late Holocene records. We show that caves with seasonally different infiltration rates may yield very different isotopic histories, because of the lack of correlation between summer and winter rainfall amounts. Finally, we find that carbon isotope records are highly variable, but poorly correlated even among samples from the same cave, and that growth rates do not seem to vary with moisture. Taken together, these records show an interplay among seasonally specific forcings over interannual-millennial time scales on Southwestern hydroclimate.",

Within approximately 2.5 years time stage, we analyze and eliminate common mode errors of residual time series through considerations of correlation analysis with seasonal temperature and mass loading in localizable basins, including of southwestern part of Qaidam Basin, Xorkol basin and Ayakkum keli basin with identical elevation and climate conditions in the southern uninhabited region of Qimen Tagh Mountain. Thus, we estimate a approximate horizontal velocity of 6-8mm/yr. along central segment of Altyn Tagh fault and vertical relative velocity of 1~2mm/yr. near the peak of Altyn Tagh mountain using continuous GPS stations, crossing the central segment of Atlyn Tagh Fault with respect to the lowest velocity of GPS station which is noted as ATFD, while it might be on the Qimen Tagh thrust fault plane. Some analysis show that crustal uplift velocity profile is better curvilinear correlation with the topography of Akato Tagh Mountain, which is defined as major orogenic belt in Northern Tibetan Plateau. We analyze geological setting and deformation model among Akaoto Tagh bend, Kadzi Fault and Huatugou fold. The result indicates modern episode of Akato Tagh is uplifted with left lateral oblique slip affected by tectonic activity between Qimen Tagh and central segment of Altyn Tagh Fualt, accompanying with the collision between India and Eurasia. We estimate a sustained uplift and localized orogenic process is still occurred, according to explicitly constrains between our continuous GPS records in short-term geodetic observation and some terraces studies of Yaziquan spring within long-term geological temporal scale since at least Quaternary near the norhtern front of Qimen Tagh Mountain .",

            "abstract": "Forest succession theory maintains that trees drape existing landscapes as passive niche optimizers. Here, we explore the opposite view – that tree type can control the landscape morphology through canopy and soil structure differences between tree types. Using field observations combined with the analysis of a 1 m-resolution LiDAR DEM and cosmogenic nuclide geochemical techniques, we report links between topographic position, erosion rates, and tree distribution above 600 m in elevation in the pristine, tropical rainforest of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico. Above 600 m, flat ridges connect a subdued topographic surface and cap a relict landscape composed of 10s-of-meters-thick saprolite derived from a quartz dioritic bedrock. Erosion in the form of concave coves dissects this landscape, exposing the underlying corestones and bedrock and progressively creating a new landscape of greater local relief and higher erosion. To understand the origin of the increase in local relief we measured the respective contributions of ridges and coves to the stream signal by analyzing 10Be in soils and stream sediments. We find that, in the coves, erosion is systematically higher than on the ridges, confirming the increase in landscape dissection. Because the overall forest structure has not been altered by anthropogenic disturbances, the tree type represents a long-term feature of the landscape. We analyzed the distribution of tree associations over the LiDAR topography by classifying high-resolution multispectral images of the forest. Vegetation in the study area is dominated by Palm and Palo Colorado forests. We found an almost systematic association of the Palm forest with the coves and of the Palo Colorado with the ridges. These forest types vary in their potential to prevent or enhance soil erosion. The Palo Colorado generates greater soil coverage and rain interception rates. Therefore, we propose that soils are more vulnerable to erosion under the Palm forest, providing a positive feedback whereby the presence of the Palm forest favors the incision of the coves while the Palo Colorado forest favors the protection of the ridges, thereby increasing local relief.",

            "abstract": "Here we report results of two experiments designed to evaluate the utility of anthropogenic noise as a source for generating body waves via interferometry. In particular we address the suggestion that traffic noise might prove effective at producing P and S waves at frequencies and amplitudes appropriate for crustal scale refraction and reflection imaging.\nThe first experiment recorded routine traffic for about 10 days along a straight stretch of a rural highway between the towns of Elmira and Ithaca in upstate New York. The array was deployed along the highway using two different spacings: an inner segment with Δx ~ 25 m, bracketed between flanking segments with Δx ~ 100 m. In addition to strong surface waves, direct and reflected P waves were clearly apparent on most of the virtual shot gathers. These P-waves match the velocities of P-waves recorded from a conventional, small scale refraction survey carried out at the same site with a shotgun source and an engineering seismograph.\nThe second experiment was located in the Rio Grande rift near Belen New Mexico, where relatively isolated train traffic was recorded for about 6 days parallel to a busy section of the BNRF railway that bisects New Mexico. Interferometric processing of the data produced virtual shot gathers with strong surface waves, as expected, but also linear arrivals that exhibit apparent velocities similar to those reported for the shallow Tertiary-Quaternary alluvium based on the original COCORP vibroseis surveys nearby. However the virtual shot gathers derived from the train sources are more complex that those obtained from the auto noise, which we suspect is due to the extended length of the train source relative to the spread length.\nBoth experiments confirm that cultural noise can be used for subsurface imaging, though the cost effectiveness of this approach depends, among other factors, upon the total length of recording time needed to probe to depths of interest. They are both sources that clearly lend themselves to exploitation by the new generation of large N array technologies.",

On a polar orbit, PACE will make climate-quality global measurements that are essential for understanding ocean biology, biogeochemistry and ecology, and determining how the ocean’s role in global biogeochemical cycling and ocean ecology both affects and is affected by climate change.\nWith advanced global remote sensing capabilities that include high spectral-resolution imaging, extended spectral coverage to the UV and SWIR, improved spatial resolution in inland, estuarine and coastal waters, enhanced atmospheric correction and higher signal-to-noise, PACE is expected to provide high quality observations that, over the long-term, will contribute to an extended time series of records on inland, coastal, and ocean ecosystems—all of which have substantial value beyond basic science and research. The combination of climate-quality, global atmospheric and oceanic observations provided by the PACE mission will provide a unique capability to help understand changes that affect our ecosystem services, implement science-based management strategies of coastal, marine and inland aquatic resources, and support assessments, policy analyses, and design approaches to plan adaptation and responses to impacts of climate change.

            "abstract": "Diamond crystals from three North American kimberlite occurrences were investigated with cathodoluminescence (CL) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to determine their growth history, carbon isotope composition and nitrogen content. Samples analyzed include sixteen from Lynx (Quebec), twelve from Kelsey Lake (Colorado) and eighteen from A154 South (Diavik mine, Northwest Territories).  Growth histories for the samples vary from simple to highly complex based on their CL images and depending on the individual stone. Deformation lamellae are evident in CL images of the Lynx crystals which typically are brownish in color. Two to five points per diamond were analyzed by SIMS for carbon isotope composition (δ13CPDB) and three to seven points for nitrogen content. The results for the A154 South (δ13CPDB = -6.76 to -1.68 ‰) and Kelsey Lake (δ13CPDB = -11.81 to -2.43 ‰) stones (mixed peridotitic and eclogitic suites) are similar to earlier reported values. The Lynx kimberlite stones have anomalously high carbon isotope ratios and range from -3.58 to +1.74 ‰. The Lynx diamond suite is almost entirely peridotitic. The unusually high (i.e. >-5‰) δ13C values of the Lynx diamonds, as well as those from Wawa, Ontario and Renard, Quebec, may indicate an anomalous carbon reservoir for the Superior cratonic mantle relative  to other cratons. In addition to the heavier carbon isotope values, the Lynx samples have very low nitrogen contents (<100 ppm). Nitrogen contents for Kelsey Lake and Diavik samples are more typical and range to ~1100 ppm. Comparison of observed core to rim variations in nitrogen content and carbon isotopes with modeled Rayleigh fractionation trends for published diamond growth mechanisms allows for evaluation of carbon speciation and other parent fluid conditions. Observed trends that closely follow modeled data are rare, but appear to suggest diamond growth from carbonate-bearing fluids at Lynx and Diavik, and growth from a methane-bearing fluid at Kelsey Lake. However the majority of crystals appear to have very complex growth histories that are clearly the result of multiple growth and resorption events. Trends observed in most of the samples from this study are chaotic and no consistent patterns are seen.",

            "abstract": "The shallow mantle is, except in extremely thin and hot plates, the stronger part of the lithosphere and hence a key layer for understanding plate tectonics. We will present mechanical and microstructural data (EBSD and TEM) from deformation experiments on olivine single crystals and polycrystals performed at low temperature (850-1100°C) and moderate pressure (300 MPa) under dry conditions. These results indicate that the shallow lithospheric mantle may deform by dislocation-based processes at much lower stresses than those predicted from the extrapolation of high-temperature experimental data for olivine. Although the experiments show heterogeneous mechanical behaviors, with hardening, the microstructural observations highlight that, even at the high strain rate of the experimental conditions, recovery processes are at play, suggesting that in nature, at lower strain rates and higher pressure, hardening by dislocation entanglement might be counteracted. Consistently, mantle rocks deformed in natural shear zones active at temperatures 850-900°C show microstructures characterized by coarse recrystallized grain sizes (≥100µm) and strong crystal preferred orientations, which are consistent with deformation dominantly by dislocation creep at rather low stresses (<100MPa). Based on our experimental results and on a compilation of previously published data on olivine deformation between 500 and 1000 °C, we propose a new semi-empirical exponential flow law, which might represent an upper limit to the uppermost mantle strength. Such a low strength shallow mantle lithosphere suggests a higher equilibrium recrystallized grain sizes, and less shear heating; further geodynamic implications will then be discussed.",

Winter storms can have with different type of precipitations such as, pristine ice crystal, sleet, graupel-like snow, rimed and aggregated snow, and each type of precipitations have very different micro-physical properties (e.g. size, density, fall speed, dielectric constant), to estimate SR accurately using radar becomes a challenge. The first step to get a proper estimator from radar observations is the precipitation classification. The form of different winter precipitation relates to the environment especially the temperature and humidity. In addition, the different precipitation type also correspond to different shape and density resulting in different fall speeds.\nRecent research shows that 2DVD is able to observe winter precipitation successfully. The 2DVD can measure the fall speed of each particle falling into its observing area, and provide the contours from two orthogonal views. It is straight forward to estimate the diameter of snowflake from two views of 2DVD and compute the particle size distribution (PSD). In order to classify the different type of precipitation, we must not only estimate the diameter but also define several geometric features. In this paper we explore a technique to estimate features from the contours of 2D-Video images.\nIn this paper, we analyze observations from two GPM winter campaigns namely, GCPEX and LPVEX. From these data sets , we derive the to get the statistics of fall speed and geometric features developed in this paper. Subsequently these are used to classify winter precipitation into four catalogs, namely rain, sleet, graupel-like snow and fluffy snow (may form by aggregation or aggregation with riming). We apply this procedure to two GCPEx cases which mixed with different type of precipitation in different time interval. Since we are using the contouring data and fall speed, this procedure may also apply to other image instruments which are capable to measure the fall speed such as the hydrometeor velocity and shape detector (HVSD) or Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). Subsequently these classifications are used in the assumptions to simulate radar observations.",

            "abstract": "The major volatile species in volcanic plume emissions (i.e., H2O, CO2, SO2, HCl, HF) are all strongly infrared (IR)-active, and lend themselves to infrared spectroscopic analysis. However, physical/optical access to plume gases along pathways which include a suitable natural or active IR radiation source is often difficult or impossible to achieve, particularly for timeframes extending beyond short campaign periods.  In this study, we present results from preliminary tests conducted on three volcanic CO2 plume emissions using a tunable diode NIR laser system (TDL, Boreal Laser Inc.).  \nThe approach is proving itself as a good candidate for continuous monitoring of volcanic plume CO2, and by default all other IR-active constituents for which lasers of appropriate wavelength are available.  The CO2 system is configured with a TDL in a transceiver generating laser light which can be tuned to coincide with one of several absorption lines in the CO2 absorption band between 1575 nm and 1585 nm. This beam propagates through the atmosphere (and plume) to a retro-reflector, which returns the beam to a photodiode detector in the transceiver which processes the signal to report real time CO2 column densities.\n The CO2 absorption line at 1579.1 nm was used to good effect on Mt Ruapehu (NZ) where volcanic gases emanate through a 100 m deep crater lake, resulting in CO2 concentrations of > 78 ppm above background in the mixing zone varying from 4 to 30 m above the lake surface.  Subsequent tests on the main plume at White Island, however, generated only poor results with indicated CO2 amounts being less than atmospheric. We concluded that this was the result of interference from a neighboring but comparatively minor H2O absorption band which in the proximal, higher temperature plume (estimated 50-70 °C), had H2O concentrations some 4-5 times greater than ambient. A change to a less sensitive absorption line further removed from potential H2O band interference (1567.9 nm) appears to have solved this problem, and yielded maximum CO2 concentrations along the 730 m pathway in excess of 500 ppm.\nThis approach holds promise for continuous, real-time monitoring of volcanic plume chemistry, and we will now turn our focus to the detection of SO2, HCl and HF plume species.

            "abstract": "The presence and valuation of risk are commonalities that link the diverse fields of climate change science and policy, environmental conservation, and the financial/investment sector. However, the definition and perception of risks vary widely across these critically linked fields. The “Stranded Asset” concept developed by organizations like the Carbon Tracker Initiative begins to elucidate the links between climate change risk and financial risk. Stranded assets are those that may lose some or all value from climate disruption, changes in demand-side dynamics and/or a more stringent regulatory environment. In order to shift financial flows toward climate change mitigation, emissions-heavy activities that present finance and investment opportunities must also be assessed for their GHG-asset risk attributes in terms of their contribution and vulnerability to climate disruption, as well as other environmental externalities. Until the concept of GHG-asset risk in investment is reconciled with the risks of climate change and environmental conservation, it will not be possible to shift business and financial practices, and unlock private sector resources to address the climate change and conservation challenge.\n UNEP-FI is researching the application of the concept of Value-atRisk (VaR) to explore links between the financial sector and deforestation/REDD+. The research will test the hypothesis that climate risk is a financial risk, and propose tools to identify and quantify risks associated with unsustainable land-use investments. The tools developed in this research will help investors, managers and governments assess their exposures to the material REDD-related risks in their portfolios. This will inform the development of ‘zero net deforestation’ investment indices to allow investors to lower the ‘deforestation’ exposure of ‘benchmark’ financial indices used by many of the largest money managers. A VaR analysis will be performed, combining the notion of externality with the traditional approach of external (exogenous) risk analysis. The VaR component introduces probabilities for different scenarios and may ultimately lead to a full distribution for the holistic losses. These distributions are non-parametric and non-linear since climate change is an “event-risk”.",

            "abstract": "Our research objective is to identify sediment transport systems that exhibit non local signals, such as those seen in the long-profile of fluvial surfaces. In previous work we have shown that appropriate nonlocal models of sediment transport under various tectonic forcing, can lead to fluvial surface shapes that are distinct from those obtained with local models. For example, in the study of a sediment bypass system, a nonlocal model for the sediment flux predicts a concave down fluvial surface in contrast to the linear surface predicted with a local flux model.\nIt is well known that hold ups and fast paths in transport systems lead to non-local behaviors. And we think that the mechanism that creates the unexpected curvatures in fluvial profiles is one of \"storage and release\". Perhaps the classic storage and release system is that seen in rice pile experiments. One set up for this experiment involves the formation of a rice pile in the gap (~25mm) between two vertical glass plates resting on a solid surface. In this system rice is added at a constant rate at the left and allowed to freely exit a distance (~0.5m) downstream; the system is run until a steady state is approached. Of course, an exact steady state is not reached because the rice does not move steadily down the pile surface but rather advances in a series of avalanches, with multiple length scales, separated by waiting times; in other words is transported via storage and release. The naive expectancy is that at the steady state the surface of the rice pile will exhibit a constant angle of repose. Our experiments with the system, however, indicate that while the storage and release mechanism invokes large temporal fluctuations in the pile its surface exhibits a persistent concave down shape. In this paper, we present the main findings of our rice pile experiment, explore models that might explain the persistence of the curved surface, and uncover the behavioral links between the rice pile model and non-local signals in fluvial sediment transport.\nThe authors acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation through Grant EAR-1318593, Generalized Transport Models in Earth Surface Dynamics.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing demand for understanding and mapping urban hydrological ecosystem services, including stormwater retention for flood mitigation and water quality improvement. Progress in integrated urban water management and low impact development in Western countries increased our understanding of how grey and green infrastructure interact to enhance these services. However, valuation methods that account for a diverse group of beneficiaries are typically not made explicit in urban water management models. In addition, the lack of spatial data on the stormwater network in developing countries makes it challenging to apply state-of-the-art models needed to understand both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the stormwater retention service. To fill this gap, we designed the Urban InVEST stormwater retention model, a tool that complements the suite of InVEST software models to quantify and map ecosystem services. We present the model structure emphasizing the data requirements from a user’s perspective and the representation of services and beneficiaries. We illustrate the model application with two case studies in a data-rich (New York City) and data-scarce environment. We discuss the difference in the level of information obtained when less resources (data, time, or expertise) are available, and how this affects multiple ecosystem service assessments that the tool is ultimately designed for.",

This finding suggests that magnetite produced by some magnetotactic bacteria retains magnetic properties in relation to the crystallographic structure of the magnetic phase produced and thus might represent a “magnetic fingerprint” for the presence of magnetotactic bacteria. The use of those magnetic properties is a non-destructive, new technology that might allow for the identification and presence of specific species or types of magnetotactic bacteria in certain environments such as sediment. We will also show some preliminary results on the biogeochemical factors that control magnetotactic bacterial populations, documenting the environment and the preservation of bacterial magnetite, which dominates the palaeomagnetic signal throughout recent sediments from Brazilian Coast. We searched for magnetotactic bacteria in order to understand the ecosystems and environmental change related to their presence in sediments. We studied magnetotactic bacterial concentration and geophysical, geochemical and oceanographic results in marine settings measuring crucially nutrients availability in the water column and in sediments, on particulate delivery to the seafloor, to understand the environmental condition that allow the presence of magnetotactic bacteria and magnetosomes in sediments.",

            "abstract": "A prominent landslide deposit in the Slope Basin seaward of the Megasplay Fault in the Nankai Trough was emplaced by a high-mobility landslide based on analysis of physical properties and seismic geomorphology. Slide acceleration is a critical variable that determines amplitude of slide-generated tsunami but is many times a variable with large uncertainty. In controlled laboratory experiments, the ratio of the shear stress to yield strength, defined as the Flow Factor, controls a wide spectrum of mass movement styles from slow, retrogressive failure to rapid, liquefied flows. We apply the laboratory Flow Factor approach to a natural landslide in the Nankai Trough by constraining pre-failure particle size analysis and porosity. Several mass transport deposits (MTDs), were drilled and cored at Site C0021 in the Nankai Trough during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 338. The largest, MTD-6, occurs at 133-176 meters below seafloor and occurred approximately 0.87 Mya. Slide volume is 2 km3, transport distance is 5 km, and average deposit thickness is 50 m (maximum 180 m). Pre-failure water content was estimated from shallow sediments at Site C0018 (porosity = 72%). The average grain size distribution is 39% clay-sized, 58% silt-sized, and 3% sand-size particles as determined by hydrometer analyses of the MTD. Together, the porosity and clay fraction predict a Flow Factor of approximately 4, which corresponds to a relatively high mobility slide. We interpret this result to indicate the landslide that created MTD-6 was a single event that transported the slide mass relatively rapidly as opposed to a slow, episodic landslide event. This is supported by the observation of a completely evacuated source area with no remnant blocks or retrogressive headscarp and the internally chaotic seismic facies with large entrained blocks. Future works will focus on the tsunamigenic potential of this high mobility slide. This approach can be extended to other field settings characterized by fine-grained siliciclastics and where porosity and clay content are known.",

            "abstract": "Renewable and intermittent energy sources are likely to become more important in the future and consequently lead to a change in the production strategies of hydropower to account for expected production fluctuations. Optimization models are used as a tool to achieve the best overall result in a network of reservoirs and hydropower plants. The computational demand increases for large networks, making simplification of the physical description of the stream flows necessary. In management optimization models, the flows behavior is often described using a constant time-lag for water on flow stretches, i.e., the release of water mass from an upstream reservoir is time-shifted as inflow to the subsequent reservoir. We developed an optimization model that included the kinematic-diffusion wave equation for flow on stretches, which was used to evaluate the role of the model improvement for short term production planning in Dalälven River, a study case with 36 hydropower stations and 13 major reservoirs . The increased complexity of the time-lag distributions of the streams resulting from the kinematic-diffusion wave equation compared to the constant time-lag model was found to be highly important for many situation of hydropower production planning in a regulated water system. The deviation of optimized power production resulting from the two models (time-lag and kinematic-diffusive) increases with decreasing Peclet number for the flow stretches – the latter being evaluated for all included stretches. A procedure emulating the data-assimilation procedure present in modern systems, using the receding horizon approach, was used in order to describe the dynamic effect of the resulting flow prediction deviation. The procedure also demonstrated the importance of high frequency data assimilation for highly effected streams, which implies that the error in predicted power production decreases with decreasing time step of forecast updating.",

            "abstract": "The footwalls of the Whipple detachment (SE California) and Brenner and Simplon lines (Alps) passed up through the BPT and were carried to the surface with minimal overprints, allowing study of products formed there and inference about BPT processes (Selverstone et al. 1995; Axen et al. 1995; Wawrzyniec et al. 1999; Axen et al. 2001; Selverstone et al. 2012).\nIn all cases embrittlement (mm – 100 m scale) was due to fluid effects and was at higher T (380 to >500°C) than expected for quartzose rocks, not due to monotonic cooling. Depths of embrittlement are typical (~9.5-18 km), so heat was advected with the footwalls. Strain rates are poorly known but may have been high. High fluid pressure (Pf) during mylonitic flow apparently aided embrittlement: fractures formed and drained fluids, Pf dropped rapidly, and plastic deformation shut off. Evidence of return to plastic processes is absent or sparse; if embrittlement was related to the seismic cycle, plasticity was not renewed in interseismic periods. Specifics differ: in the Whipple footwall, reaction strengthening preceded embrittlement, sealed and locked up mylonites, and Pf increased, aiding embrittlement. In the Brenner footwall, a thin (~50 m) hydrously altered mylonite zone persisted above deeper brittle mylonites, suggesting that deeper cracks delivered hydrous fluids upward to a weakened, overlying plastic shear zone, locally inverting the BPT. In the Simplon footwall, along-strike structural changes correspond to a change from hydrous to hydrous + carbonic fluids: non-wetting carbonic fluids blocked fluid migration and Pf rose until brittle failure occurred.\nIncluding transtensile (e.g., Griffith) failure, fluid pressure and/or fluid-rock reactions will improve BPT models. Thrust upper plates may behave similarly but the stress field should favor subhorizontal cracks and opening may be subdued so the BPT may evolve differently. Cracking in the upper part of a subhorizontally shearing BPT may deepen it.",

            "abstract": "The initiation of Cenozoic continental ice sheets and the history of their growth/decay is difficult to reconstruct because of the mixed effects of polar ice volume and temperature on benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope values. Coupled measurements of foraminiferal δ18O and Mg/Ca are a promising tool to unlock the history of past continental glaciation by calculating the oxygen isotopic composition of paleo-seawater. This method has been applied on Quaternary timescales with success, but uncertainty about secular changes in seawater Mg/Ca and potential changes in carbonate saturation have produced varying results with deeper time data. Currently, no experimentally-calibrated model explains how the Mg/Ca of low-Mg calcite, such as secreted by benthic foraminifera, responds to variations in seawater temperature and Mg/Ca. Our “Foram Farm” is a culture system for low-Mg calcite benthic foraminifera, composed of a colony and an experimental line. Currently, the colony hosts several species of rotaliids, miliolids, and buliminids obtained from Qatar, the Dominican Republic, Scotland, and Long Island Sound, USA. In addition, two tanks contain “live sand,” a mixture of sandy material and seawater obtained from tropical reefs, and commonly used to condition hobbyist saltwater aquaria. This sand contains foraminifera and numerous other microorganisms. “Live sand” could be a source for cheap and easy to obtain test subjects. The foram farm gives access to a constant supply and variety of test subjects for the experimental line, which consists of several analytical refrigerators with varying temperatures. Each refrigerator houses petri dishes where forams are grown in water with varying Mg/Ca compositions. Elphidium excavatum, a well-researched, eurytopic taxon, will be the first to be cultured in the experimental line. After growing under experimental conditions, specimens will be analyzed using LA-ICP-MS, in order to model effects of seawater T and Mg/Ca on foram Mg/Ca. These calibration data may reduce uncertainties surrounding deep-time estimates of continental ice volume as well as seawater temperature and chemistry.",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has been orbiting the Moon for over five years. In that time, data from the seven instruments onboard the spacecraft have made significant advances in our understanding of the Moon and its environment. In September 2014 LRO completed its first Extended Science Mission (ESM) and began a second ESM (pending NASA approval). During the ESM and the second ESM, LRO has been in a quasi-stable, eccentric orbit of ~30 x 180 km with a periapse near the South Pole. This orbit enabled high-resolution measurements around the South Pole. LRO’s seven instruments are operating nominally, and have experienced no significant degradation since beginning the ESM. The spacecraft has performed exceptionally well, with 98.4% uptime during the mission. LRO retains sufficient fuel so that its current orbit can be maintained for at least 8 years.\nLRO’s science teams have been extremely productive, focusing on the distribution of volatiles, evidence for early differentiation, measuring the lunar impact record, and the Moon’s interactions with its external environment. Three of the most exciting findings by LRO have been the identification of LRO-era impacts, global tectonic features, and the transient nature of some volatiles at the surface. These findings are areas of study for future LRO measurements.\nLRO’s data is released to the PDS every 3 months, as of Aug. 2014 528.75 TB of data have been delivered by LRO. Many of the teams have delivered higher-level data products as part of their routine PDS deliveries (e.g., mosaics, maps, derived products). These products are intended to act as useful resources for the science community. Some higher-level LRO data products are of interest for future lunar landers. These products include illumination maps, meter-scale digital elevation models, roughness maps, and 50cm per pixel images of a range of possible landing sites. All of these products are available either from the PDS [1] or individual teams websites [2-5]. If members of the community require assistance finding and/or using data from LRO, they are invited to contact the authors of this abstract.\n[1] http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/lro/default.htm\n[2] http://imbrium.mit.edu/\n[3] http://diviner.ucla.edu/\n[4] http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/\n[5] http://lro.gsfc.nasa.gov/",

            "abstract": "A traditional view of the origins of the solar wind states that slow wind streams arise from coronal hole boundaries due to the larger expansion factor. It is hard in this explanation to understand why the slow wind occupies so much space in the heliosphere. Pseudostreamers are multipolar features which develop into fields that are unipolar at greater heights. There is debate as to the speed and nature of the wind from pseudostreamers: it could be fast, slow, or in between. And, in general, they might form a network of slow wind which may or may not connect in the heliosphere to slow wind coming from around the heliospheric current sheet. Here we discuss the relationship between the expansion factor along PFSS extrapolated magnetic field lines of pseudostreamers and wind speed and plasma properties calculated with numeral modeling. We demonstrate how the resulting wind type depends on the stage of pseudostreamer development in the context of the global coronal environment: factors in determining wind speed include the height of the pseudostreamer null point, the presence or absence of filament channels, and the expansion of coronal magnetic field lines in the neighborhood of the pseudostreamer spine. This study helps to better understand the sources of slow and fast solar wind for the Solar Probe Plus mission.",

            "abstract": "Models of groundwater flow often work best when very little field data exist. In such cases, some knowledge of the depth to the water table, annual precipitation totals, and basic geological makeup is sufficient to produce a reasonable-looking and potentially useful model. However, in this case where a good deal of information is available regarding depth to bottom of a dune field aquifer, attempting to incorporate the data set into the model has variously resulted in convergence, failure to achieve target water level criteria, or complete failure to converge. The first model did not take the data set into consideration, but used general information that the aquifer was thinner in the north and thicker in the south. This model would run and produce apparently useful results. The first attempt at satisfying the data set; in this case 51 wells showing the bottom elevation of a Pacific coast sand dune aquifer, was to use the isopach interpretation of Robinson (OFR 73-241). Using inhomogeneities (areas of equal characteristics) delineated by Robinson’s isopach diagram did not enable an adequate fit to the water table lakes, and caused convergence problems when adding pumping wells. The second attempt was to use a Thiessen polygon approach, creating an aquifer thickness zone for each data point. The results for the non-pumping scenario were better, but run times were considerably greater. Also, there were frequent runs with non-convergence, especially when water supply wells were added. Non-convergence may be the result of the lake line-sinks crossing the polygon boundaries or proximity of pumping wells to inhomogeneity boundaries. The third approach was to merge adjacent polygons of similar depths; in this case within 5% of each other. The results and run times were better, but matching lake levels was not satisfactory. The fourth approach was to reduce the number of inhomogeneities to four, and to average the depth data over the inhomogeneity. The thicknesses were varied within 5% of the average until the lake levels were closely matched. This last methodology proved satisfactory and stable. The data were honored and the solver worked relatively quickly; thus preserving the simplicity and speed of the Analytic Element method; and various pumping scenarios were stable.",

This will be a particularly salient consideration for future schemes to utilize wind energy in the Maghreb, a region of Africa marked by the presence of the Sahara desert, the world’s largest source of mineral dust. In this study we analyzed the correlation between wind speed and the existence of dust in measurements pertaining to the region. Wind speed data was acquired from meteorological masts along with reanalysis output. Comparisons were made to the presence of polluted and desert dust as identified by CALIOP, a satellite-based lidar instrument, and to coarse-mode Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements from the AERONET network of sun photometers. It was anticipated that results would evidence the existence of a critical wind speed that is required for the emission of noticeable desert dust. The proximity of this threshold to the ideal range of wind speeds for turbine efficiency can potentially influence the feasibility of harvesting wind energy in the region.",

The currently existing small-scale experiments have been focusing on the single X-line reconnection process in plasmas either with small effective sizes or at low Lundquist numbers, both of which are typically very large in natural plasmas. These new regimes involve multiple X-lines as guided by a reconnection \"phase diagram\", in which different coupling mechanisms from the global system scale to the local dissipation scale are classified into different reconnection phases [H. Ji & W. Daughton, Phys. Plasmas 18, 111207 (2011)]. The design of the FLARE device is based on the existing Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) at Princeton (http://mrx.pppl.gov) and is to provide experimental access to the new phases involving multiple X-lines at large effective sizes and high Lundquist numbers, directly relevant to space and solar plasmas.

The FO cables were deployed at 3 depths: 5, 10, and 15 cm. In this system the FO sensing system provides measurements of soil moisture at >39,000 locations simultaneously for each heat pulse. Six soil monitoring stations along the fiber optic path were installed to provide additional validation and calibration of the AHFO data. Gravimetric soil moisture and soil thermal samplings were performed periodically to provide additional distributed validation and calibration of the DTS data. In this work we present the preliminary results of this experiment. We will also address the experience learned from this large scale deployment of the AHFO method. In particular, we will present the in-situ soil moisture calibration method developed to tackle the calibration challenges associated with the high spatial heterogeneity of the soil physical and thermal properties.\nThe material is based upon work supported by NASA under award NNX12AP58G, with equipment and assistance also provided by CTEMPs.org with support from the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1129003.

            "abstract": "Climate extremes are a major challenge for corn producers in the central United States. Among those extremes are wet springs that lead to planting delays, late spring and early fall frosts that can damage crops, and extreme summer temperatures either too warm or too cool. A newly-operational corn growing degree-day (CGDD) tool helps producers manage and adapt to these extremes. For example, a challenge in recent years has been exceptionally wet springs that have led to significant planting delays. Producers have been forced to re-assess their planting strategies on short notice, such as switching to a faster-growing but lower-yielding hybrids. With this pattern of wetter springs projected to continue or worsen in the central United States, the problem will remain and likely get worse. Another example is helping producers identify the risk of early or late frost/freezes. The CGDD tool puts current conditions into a 30-year historical perspective and offers trend projections (based on climatology or forecasts) through the end of the calendar year. Corn, or sometimes called modified, growing degree-days use a temperature base of 10 C (50 F) and a ceiling of 30 C (86 F) and is strongly correlated with the development of the corn crop.

            "abstract": "Submesoscale oceanic fronts have been implicated in the turbulent energy cascade, and in nutrient supply into and carbon export out of the euphotic zone. However, their large-scale extent is unknown due to their characteristic small spatial (1-10km) and short time (~1 day) scales that complicate observations. Current large-scale understanding of fronts from satellite SST and ocean color is limited to a climatological view of occurrence frequency in cloud-free events. We show that useful estimates of frontal spatial coverage and structure can be derived from the recently available, merged satellite Level-4 SST product (G1SST at 1km resolution) using a gradient-based detection method in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre (28o-38oN, -75o- -45oW ). G1SST fronts are validated with in-situ fronts in continuous ship measurements from the Oleander Project. At a matching distance of Δx=5km, 79% of the G1SST fronts are in-situ fronts, and 64% of the in-situ fronts are detected by G1SST; these matches up increase with larger Δx. Comparing with in-situ velocities, ~56% of the fronts are coincident with across-track velocity jets with low-pass filter at scales > 5km，and 70% at scales > 50km, indicating that fronts are in large-scale geostrophic balance. Near-surface vertical shear predicted from thermal-wind relationship is in-phase but much smaller than (<50%) observed shear, indicating large ageostrophic shear is inclined to be co-located with surface baroclinic zones, likely due to interaction between fronts and gravity waves.\nFor the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, we find that submesoscale fronts comprise 57±4.6% of the total surface area. Fronts are found not only in the energetic Gulf Steam region, but also are surprisingly numerous in the quiescent subtropical gyre. This finding is consistent with previous modeling studies that indicate that submesoscale fronts could help to resolve the ‘nutrient--primary production’ balance in oligotrophic regions.",

            "abstract": "Accurately predicting bed load transport rates remains challenging, with many influential factors still poorly understood, including unsteady flows and stream bed armoring. Nearly all natural channels experience unsteady flows, and hydrograph form varies significantly from gradually (i.e. snowmelt) to rapidly changing flows (i.e. rain driven or many regulated flows). However, most predictive methods neglect hydrograph impacts, and nearly all bedload transport experiments use steady flows. Stream bed armoring likely influences bedload transport rates as well, with the coarser surface limiting the availability of the finer, more mobile grain sizes in the subsurface. It remains uncertain whether armor persists, breaks up, or exchanges particles with bedload during high flow events. Coupled effects of hydrograph form and armor may also be significant, and previous work indicates that more gradual changes in flow promote more significant armoring compared to rapid changes in flow.\nTo better understand the impacts of hydrograph form and armoring on bedload transport processes in gravel-bed rivers, flume experiments were conducted at the University of Idaho’s Stream Lab. An armored, equilibrium bed was established as the initial condition for all experiments, which included steady-state discharges and a variety of hydrograph forms from gradually to rapidly changing. Steady-state runs allowed for comparison of bedload transport for a given discharge run singularly and in the context of various hydrographs. Though hydrograph form varied, minimum and peak flow rates and the total estimated transport capacity were held constant between runs. Armor ratios were estimated before and after runs by sampling the surface and subsurface separately. Armor behavior during runs was tracked by spray-painting the bed surface in three cross-sections that were repeatedly photographed then excavated after runs. Additional data collection during runs included photos for bed grain size analysis, bedload transport rates and total bedload flux. This set of experiments will provide improved understanding and quantification of armor and hydrograph impacts on bedload transport processes which could be applied to significantly improve predictions of bedload transport.",

            "abstract": "Studies on dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics have been recently advanced by the advent of deployable, in-situ sensors capable of measuring both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOC characteristics. These methods, combined with improvements in fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, allow for high temporal resolution investigation of DOC flux into aquatic systems, as well as DOC flowpaths within coupled terrestrial-aquatic systems. This study utilizes a combination of in-situ UV-Vis absorbance spectrophotometry, as well as laboratory-based analysis by fluorescence spectrophotometry of corresponding water samples, to investigate how forest harvest affects organic matter flux in a small headwater stream located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The majority of DOC flux occurring during the wet winter months during both pre- and post-harvest periods, while clear-cut harvesting significantly increased the concentration and flux of DOC export. The concentration-discharge relationship for both periods showed transport-limited behavior. This was not significantly altered upon harvest; however the examination of specific events showed that DOC response greatly increased in the post-harvest period for specific storm events. Concentration-discharge relationships evaluated using segmented regression analysis demonstrated a large amount of inter-annual variability in streamwater DOC concentrations. However, when DOC concentration is modeled with a least-squares linear regression model, the pre- vs. post harvest period remains the best predictor of DOC concentration, followed by year (reflecting the large degree of inter-annual variability). Precipitation is a greater predictor of DOC concentration rather than discharge, groundwater height, baseflow or quickflow. The fluorescence characteristics of streamwater DOC show that the DOC fraction is dominated by humic-like structures within both periods. Examining DOC quality parameters obtained through in situ absorbance spectrophotometry supports this shift towards DOC originating from shallower soil horizons. This was confirmed by investigating DOC quality metrics of mobile DOC from various soil profile depths (through analysis of lysimeter and soil extract samples).",

            "abstract": "Water engineers do not like people; we are better with numbers, equations and models where people behavior is only a variable, usually constant, or in the best case a probabilistic approximation. On the other side, most economic studies relate to people’s behavior, and when economists develop engineering-based models, engineers usually think that econometric approaches are too simple to represent complex systems that engineers like to work with.\nBesides this simple-minded cliche, there is a lot of field to explore in the intersections of both disciplines. Even though the development of infrastructure cost-benefit analyses after Dupuit’s work, or the more recent growth of hydroeconomic modeling, we are still missing a lot of potential synergic benefits from integrating behavioral economics and water infrastructure design and management.\nTo present a simple example: urban water infrastructure design is based on water peaks, so reservoirs, pump stations and pipe dimensions have to be built to serve these peaks; water-related energy assessment studies have shown that there is a lot of energy used for every drop of water used in our houses, farms, and industries, and energy peaks are even larger that water peaks, creating expensive troubles for energy supply; and all this energy consumption means greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore we agree that reducing water peaks might create a lot of benefits, but could water customers change their behavior? Which incentives do they need? It is only about money, or it may be managed with better information?\nBeyond this example there are many other promising economic topics that could help in our daily water problems, such as: game theoretic approaches to understand decisions; science-based agent models that help us to understand the performance of a system as the sum of agents’ actions and interactions; or the analysis of institutional-driven management to avoid the tragedy of the commons that depletes groundwater resources globally.\nAnd no need to remind that all resource scarcity problems will increase with population growth, so it would be better to begin work sooner on these problems.",

            "abstract": "U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircon is an effective method for evaluating exhumation history, provenance, and depositional age constraints of sedimentary deposits. Over 1400 grains evaluated from thirteen samples collected from distal and proximal Oligo-Miocene strata of Adriatic turbidites are consistent with modern characterization of the proposed source region. Studies indicate that the principal source area of Oligo-Miocene strata from Adriatic deposits is the Lepontine Dome of the Central Alps. Our data reveals a significant shift in detrital zircon U-Pb age populations during the Oligocene-Miocene boundary which, when compared with data from modern sands, closely correlates to the westward shift of the erosional foci within the Lepontine Dome, from the Ticino to the Toce subdome, due to progressive indentation of Adria. This is coeval with progressive unroofing of Periadriatic magmatic rocks of Tertiary age along the Insubric Fault.\nThe lowermost Upper Oligocene proximal samples collected from the Como and Villa Olmo Conglomerates are dominated by Caledonian and Cadomian detrital zircon U-Pb age populations. The uppermost Oligocene and lower Miocene proximal samples collected from the Como Conglomerate are dominated instead by Periadriatic detrital zircon.\nDistal samples collected from the Lower Oligocene Aveto Formation have a dominant Periadriatic age peak with lesser amounts of late Cretaceous, Variscan, Caledonian and Cadomian detrital zircon. The lowermost Upper Oligocene distal samples collected from the Macigno Formation contain populations of Periadriatic, Variscan, Caledonian, and Cadomian detrital zircon, with major shifts in relative abundance from the lower to upper strata. The most dramatic shift in provenance in the distal units is between two samples located relatively proximally to one another in the Modino unit: Upper Oligocene marls contains primarily Variscan and Caledonian zircon grains with no individuals yielding Periadriatic ages, whereas the Upper Oligocene – Lower Miocene sandstones of the same unit include dominant Periadriatic and Variscan age populations. The youngest distal sample, from the Lower Miocene Bobbio Formation, primarily contains Variscan detrital zircon ages.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires can become positive feedbacks in climate change scenarios, because wildfires release large amounts of carbon sequestered in plants and soil to the atmosphere, and because their frequency increases with increasing temperatures. Invasive plants represent an important biotic link between anthropogenic activity and wildfire, as many of these species benefit from human disturbance while increasing fire frequency and severity. A robust body of literature addresses the response of invasive species to nitrogen enrichment, and a separate body of research assesses the feedbacks between invasive plant species and wildfire. We have undertaken a systematic review of these fields in order to evaluate the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen loading contributes to increasing wildfires by promoting the growth and spread of fire-adapted invasive plant species.\nWe identified invasive plant species using the Fire Effects Information System (FEIS), a Forest Service database that evaluates fire ecology of species identified as being of concern by land managers. We used information contained in the FEIS as well as more recent studies to characterize species on a continuum from fire-adapted to fire-intolerant based on traits related to interactions of fire with survival, reproduction, and spread. Of the 107 invasive plant species with fire ecology reports in the FEIS, we have initially classified 18 as fire-adapted, possessing traits that intensify fire regimes. Additionally, 33 species are fire-tolerant, benefiting from fire primarily because it creates a high-resource, low-competition environment. In continuing work, we are evaluating the responses of the invasive plant species to increased anthropogenic nitrogen with a focus on traits such as germination, productivity, and survival, as these traits contribute to wildfire frequency and severity.

            "abstract": "A 2-meter thick condensed section enriched in foraminifera is the final detachment horizon of a retrogressive submarine landslide, in the Ursa Basin, northern Gulf of Mexico. The high concentration of foraminifera (up to 900% relative to background values) in this layer produces a high porosity (up to 5 porosity units), low sonic velocity, low resistivity, and high gamma ray zone relative to the background clay properties. A high acoustic impedance contrast occurs at this interface and results in a high-amplitude reflection that is widespread and easily mappable in seismic. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 308 Site U1324 cored and logged this layer. We acquired 31 samples: 22 from the foraminifera-enriched layer and 9 to establish background values. Objectives were to (1) quantify foraminifera enrichment relative to background values, (2) describe the spatial arrangement of foraminifera within the clay, (3) identify the foraminifera assemblage, and (4) determine particle size. CT images show individual foraminifera dispersed within the clay and are predominantly in-tact. Foraminifera concentration is variable within the layer but average 0.75 grams of foraminifera per gram of sediment (maximum = 0.97 grams of foraminifera per gram of sediment). Foraminifera concentration correlates to particle size of the hosting sediment: highest foraminifera concentrations occur within the finest-grained samples and vice versa. This explains the high gamma ray response. The assemblage is expected for this time interval in the Late Pleistocene (~24 kya) with an abundance of Globorotalia ruber and Globorotalia sacculifer. This suggests the layer is in-situ and a result of a pause in terrigenous sedimentation. The landslide was a multi-detachment event that initiated in a deeper horizon but retrogressively cut upwards. The condensed section was a preferred detachment horizon but only minimal sliding occurred before further movement ceased. One potential mechanism to explain this is the presence of foraminifera causes a dilational shear strengthening behavior, which acts to arrest movement. On a broader scale, condensed sections with abundant microfossils, may play a key role in landslide mechanics by altering the shearing properties of the parent material.",

Diviner measures solar reflectance and infrared radiance in 9 spectral channels with bandpasses from 0.3 – 400 μm. With more than 5 years of continuous data, complete spatial coverage of the lunar surface is achieved multiple times and coverage of local solar time enables the diurnal curve to be well-resolved for a given subsolar point.\nThe Diviner Foundation Dataset (FDS) represents a coordinated effort to recalibrate raw data to improve quality, and produce a definitive and comprehensive set of products for use by the lunar science community. We present the contents and organization of the FDS, background on the enhanced processing pipeline, show how it is retrieved from NASA’s Planetary Data System, and demonstrate its use with common mapping & analysis tools.\nThe FDS comprises level 1 Reduced Data Records (RDRs) and level 2/3 Gridded Data Records (GDRs). We produce new RDRs using improved calibration algorithms that remove instrument artifacts and improve accuracy of measured radiance, particularly for polar data in permanently shadowed regions. GDRs are built using a per-orbit gridding scheme, and data are sourced from a database constructed by modeling the effective field-of-view for each observation.\nNotable gridded products available for lunar science include: 1) Globally mapped brightness temperatures for all channels in tiled cylindrical and polar stereographic map projections, 2) Global hourly temperature snapshots – maps of bolometric temperature binned into 1 hour intervals of local time, 3) Topographic products (elevation, slope and azimuth) for each map tile, that represent the terrain model used to process the data, and 4) Accompanying gridded maps of auxiliary quantities such as emission angle, local solar time, error etc…, for filtering observations to those within desired constraints.",

            "abstract": "Only a limited amount of information derived from studies conducted at small catchment scales can be transferred to large scales because of the non-linear scale effects, thus necessitating studies (including nutrient concentrations and yields) across a range of scales. Here we present results from an investigation of spatial scale pattern and temporal variability of nutrient concentration in the River Eden in northwest England, a nested catchment stretching from Gais Gill (1.1 km2) to Great Corby (1373 km2). The monitoring involved seasonal campaigns and spot sampling of river water quality, using two United Kingdom national catchment study platforms. Nitrate concentration shows a clear increasing trend with the catchment area and there is highly significant difference (P<0.001) among the catchments. Compared with the headwater areas, phosphorus (P) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations are significantly higher (P<0.05) downstream but do not show a very clear spatial pattern. An alternative explanation was therefore sought for their distribution along the river. Generally, intensity of agricultural activities appears to influence the concentrations of these water quality parameters. The field data show that the amount of nutrients and suspended sediment is higher in catchments with higher farming activities and this increase downstream. This underscores the importance of the distribution of agricultural land use as a driving force in nutrient transport in River Eden. Higher nitrate concentration is associated with the period of low flow (strongest negative relationship, R2 = 0.97, was recorded in autumn sampling campaign at a gauging station). In contrast, phosphorus and suspended sediment are positively associated with discharge (strongest relationship (R2= 0.97) for total P were recorded in spring campaign at a gauging station). Similarly the dryness or wetness of a season affects the nutrient concentrations.\nThus, it appears that hydrology and land use distribution, from the headwater to the lowland areas downstream, control the spatial behaviour of the nutrients and suspended sediment concentration in the River Eden. The findings are being generalized for wider applicability in the UK using the TOPCAT-NP model.\nKey words: scale, nitrate, phosphorus, River Eden, agricultural activity",

Delgada using closely spaced seismic-reflection profiles, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and marine magnetics data. This new dataset documents NSAF location and continuity, associated tectonic geomorphology, shallow stratigraphy and deformation. Variable deformation patterns in the generally narrow (~1-km-wide) fault zone are largely associated with fault trend and fault bends.\nWe have described four regions (Pt. Arena, Basin, Shelter Cove, and Mendocino) along and adjacent to the NSAF based on fault trend, deformation styles, seismic stratigraphy, and seafloor bathymetry. The NSAF in the southern region (Pt. Arena) of the survey area is imaged as an arcuate fault trace that changes ~15° (327° to 342°) from south to north over a distance of about 50 km. The NSAF in the middle two regions (Basin and Shelter Cove) passes through two acute fault bends (~9° and ~8°), resulting in both an asymmetric “lazy z” sedimentary basin and an uplifted rocky shoal (\"Tolo Bank\"). The northwestern region of the survey area (Mendocino) lies west of the NSAF and Shelter Cove, and includes an east-trending fault zone related to the Mendocino transform fault that extends onshore near Punta Gorda.\nUsing the densely spaced seismic-reflection profiles we have created an isopach map of Holocene sediment throughout the survey area. This isopach map has revealed thick sediment piles adjacent to coastal watersheds with high uplift rates.\nWe infer from fault geometries, local bathymetry/topography and aero/marine magnetics that the NSAF zone transitions from a broadly distributed fault zone to a narrow fault zone over a short distance near Shelter Cove, Ca. At Shelter Cove the NSAF is characterized as a narrow, continuous fault. North of Shelter Cove the San Andreas likely terminates into a series of “horse tail” splay thrust faults known as the Kings Range Thrust. These observations allows for the NSAF near Shelter Cove, CA to accommodate significant slip, in agreement with paleoseismic studies and historical records. ",

The Guides focus on “deep sky” objects and astrophysics themes (stars and stellar evolution, galaxies and the universe, and exoplanets), showcasing EPO resources from more than 30 NASA astrophysics missions and programs in a coordinated and cohesive “big picture” approach across the electromagnetic spectrum, grounded in best practices to best serve the needs of the target audiences.\nEach monthly guide features a theme and a representative object well-placed for viewing, with an accompanying interpretive story, finding charts, strategies for conveying the topics, and complementary supporting NASA-approved education activities and background information from a spectrum of NASA missions and programs. The Universe Discovery Guides are downloadable from the NASA Night Sky Network web site at nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov.\nWe will share the Forum-led Collaborative’s experience in developing the guides, how they place individual science discoveries and learning resources into context for audiences, and how the Guides can be readily used in scientist public outreach efforts, in college and university introductory astronomy classes, and in other engagements between scientists, students and the public.",

The evolution of crystal fabric is driven by strain-induced grain rotation, as well as recrystallization. Most fabric-evolution models ignore or parameterize many of the physical processes involved, or are valid only for highly parameterized fabrics. Here, we describe a new fabric model that incorporates a more-realistic treatment of the physics involved. The model includes connectivity information between grains, with grains exchanging mass and interacting with their neighbors. The model treats dynamic recrystallization, polygonization, grain rotation, and other processes. We validate the model against thin-section data from the WAIS divide ice-core. By initializing the model with a number of fabrics generated by resampling shallow thin sections (with replacement) we show that a large proportion of fabric variability seen in deeper thin sections is stochastic, arising both from initial conditions and from the variability inherent in fabric development.",

Recent analyses of geothermal data have been performed with data obtained from the borehole climatology data base of the International Heat Flow Commission that contains subsurface temperature profiles for over 600 sites spread across the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority of maximum borehole depths varying between 200 m to 600 m. Due to the nature of heat conduction, different depth ranges contain the record of past and persistent changes in the energy balance between the lower atmosphere and the ground for different time periods.\n Here we examine the dependency of estimated ground surface temperature histories and subsurface heat content changes on the maximum depth of the borehole temperature profile. We find that previous results remain unchanged for the period since industrialisation, but differ during earlier periods over the last millennium. We suggest that large-scale temperature reconstructions from terrestrial boreholes should be derived from datasets that comprise boreholes truncated at similar thermal depths. Analyses that do not control for the impacts of the depth of truncation are otherwise subject to difficult-to-estimate biases in temperature change estimates during the early and middle part of the last millennium.",

What is presently lacking in the field of quartz research is a quartz composition database. Such a single body of information can be used to evaluate whether variation seen in different crystallization environments is equally manifest in quartz composition. In this study we present >2000 new quartz analyses from >70 different granitoids and volcanic settings from around the globe (Lachlan Fold Belt, High Himalaya, French Massif, Cordilleran, Caledonian, White Mountains, Bishop, Toba, Snake River, Oman ophiolite and a number of other select locations). This dataset also combines data from a number of previous studies and together the data may collectively be used to determine which geochemical characteristics can be used to distinguish quartz from different magma types. A number of trace element concentrations or ratios (e.g., Al/Ti, Ge, Li, P and B) are notably useful when distinguishing peraluminous (e.g., cordierite-bearing granitoid) systems from more metaluminous systems (e.g., hornblende granodiorite) or plagiogranites.",

            "abstract": "Natural particles suspended in surface water are often non-spherical. We explore the ways in which particle shape effects particle motion, focusing specifically on how particle rotation is divided into spinning and tumbling components. This, in turn, will effect particle collision, clustering, and settling rates. We focus on idealized axisymmetric particles shaped as rods, discs, and spheroids. They are chosen so as to explain the physics of aspherical-particle motion that will be relevant for natural particles such as plankton, sediment, or aggregates (e.g. oil-mineral aggregates, clay flocs, or bio-sediment aggregates held together by TEP). Our work begins with laboratory measurements of particle motion in a turbulence tank built to mimic the flow found in rivers, estuaries, and the ocean surface mixed layer. We then proceed to direct numerical simulation of particle-flow interactions in sheared turbulence similar to that which is found in the surface water of creeks and rivers.\nWe find that shape has only a very weak effect on particle angular velocity, which is a quantity calculated with respect the global reference frame (i.e. east/north/up). If we analyze rotation in a particle's local frame (i.e. the particle's principle axes of rotation), then particle shape has a strong effect on rotation. In the local frame, rotation is described by two components: tumbling and spinning. We find that rod-shaped particles spin more than they tumble, and we find that disc-shaped particles tumble more than they spin. Such behavior is indicative of how particles respond the the directional influence of vortex tubes in turbulence, and such response has implications for particle motion other than rotation. Understanding particle alignment is relevant for predicting particle-particle collision rates, particle-wall collision rates, and the shear-driven breakup of aggregates. We discuss these briefly in the context of what can be concluded from the rotation data discussed above.",

            "abstract": "Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is an excellent proxy for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in natural waters. Through this relationship, in situ FDOM can be utilized to capture both high frequency time series and long term fluxes of DOC in small streams. However, in order to calculate accurate DOC fluxes for comparison across sites, in situ FDOM data must be compensated for matrix effects. Key matrix effects, include temperature, turbidity and the inner filter effect due to color. These interferences must be compensated for to develop a reasonable relationship between FDOM and DOC. In this study, we applied laboratory-derived correction factors to real time data from the five USGS WEBB headwater streams in order to gauge their effectiveness across a range of matrix effects. The good news is that laboratory derived correction factors improved the predicative relationship (higher r2) between DOC and FDOM when compared to uncorrected data. The relative importance of each matrix effect (i.e. temperature) varied by site and by time, implying that each and every matrix effect should be compensated for when available. In general, temperature effects were more important on longer time scales, while corrections for turbidity and DOC inner filter effects were most prevalent during hydrologic events, when the highest instantaneous flux of DOC occurred. Unfortunately, even when corrected for matrix effects, in situ FDOM is a weaker predictor of DOC than A254, a common surrogate for DOC, implying that either DOC fluoresces at varying degrees (but should average out over time), that some matrix effects (e.g. pH) are either unaccounted for or laboratory-derived correction factors do not encompass the site variability of particles and organics. The least impressive finding is that the inherent dependence on three variables in the FDOM correction algorithm increases the likelihood of record data gaps which increases the uncertainty in calculated DOC flux values.",

            "abstract": "The Andean building has been traditionally considered as a consequence of successive orogenic phases mostly occurring during the Cenozoic. However evidence from Peru-northern Chile and southern Argentina have shown a first contractional pulse during the mid to late Cretaceous. Between these regions, however, there are no reports evidencing this event, hence which open the questions about the real impact of this orogeny along the western boundary of South America. Likewise, the occurrence of this event in central Chile-Argentina could be evidencing that this first contractional pulse in the Andes respond to a major synchronous orogeny along the entire former western margin of Gondwana after a long period of extension since the Triassic. In this context, our study, located approximately at the latitude of the Aconcagua mount (32º50'S), reveals the existence of contractional structures, developed east of the Early Cretaceous magmatic arc, deforming Aptian rocks deposited in an extensional setting. Particularly, the geometry exhibited by a regional east-vergent anticline evidences inversion tectonics in which a thick Albian molasse unit is developed in the frontal limb and beyond with growth strata. Later this synorogenic deposits were thrusted and then covered unconformably by Upper Cretaceous volcanic unit, sealing the deformation of the Aptian-Albian rocks. Finally all these deposits were gently deformed and unconformably covered by a Maastrichtian volcanic unit. Studies of provenance indicate a transitional arc origin for the sandstones contained in the synorogenic deposits, which is in agree with the reported exhumation of previous Andean magmatic arc. Our data evidence the beginning of the contractional deformation, marking the onset of the orogeny in central Chile, during the mid-Cretaceous. Therefore we can propose that the Peruvian orogenic phase extended along most of the Southamerican margin. The location farther west, close to the concurrent arc, and it slightly older age respect to that evidenced north and south of the study region would not indicate a diachronism in the orogenic onset, but that deformation progressed from the arc to the eastern foreland. Considering that this orogeny lasted since the Albian to the Upper Cretaceous.\nThis study has been supported by the FONDECYT project N° 1120272.",

In this new class of model, biome boundaries are predicted as the emergent properties of plant physiology, and are therefore sensitive to the high-dimensional parameterizations of plant functional traits. These new approaches offer the facility to quantitatively test ecophysiological hypotheses of plant distribution at large scales, a field which remains surprisingly under-developed.\nHere we describe experiments conducted with the Community Land Model Ecosystem Demography component, CLM(ED), in which we reduce the complexity of the problem by testing how individual plant functional trait changes to control the location of biome boundaries between functional types. Specifically, we investigate which physiological trade-offs determine the boundary between frequently burned savanna and forest biomes, and attempt to distinguish how each strategic life-history trade-off (carbon storage, bark investment, re-sprouting strategy) contributes towards the maintenance of sharp geographical gradients between fire adapted and typically inflammable closed canopy ecosystems. This study forms part of the planning for a model-inspired fire manipulation experiment at the cerrado-forest boundary in South-Eastern Brazil, and the results will be used to guide future data-collection and analysis strategies.",

Nevertheless: in a time of methodological consolidation and transfer of the networks to technically more integrated infrastructures, a critical view on its weak points may strengthen the future success and our position within biogeochemical science. Four points should be discussed:\nWe have to select our sites more thoroughly.\nWe need better data curation.\nWe should think about ‘forgetting’ some of the older datasets.\nWe have responsibility for the results of integration studies.\nad 1: We had to learn during the past years that the EC is not applicable in all terrains. Slope and footprint problems are widespread and sites have to be critically scrutinized before being sure that we submit valuable ecological information. This is time consuming and may be frustrating since we have to accept that we had sometimes invested lots of work and money for building a flux tower at a site that is not suitable for the method. Nevertheless, a clear site quality policy should be developed among infrastructures and integrating activities.\nad 2: In some cases it has turned out that the information about different steps leading from the raw data to a number in integrated scientific papers has been lost. This is a big challenge to research infrastructures that should develop common rules for data curation to increase trust in integration activities.\nad 3: In the first approach Fluxnet left the responsibility for site and data quality to the site PI and accepted more or less all data submitted. Further approaches and in particular long-term infrastructures have to develop strategies to reject (or at least flag) data from sites that are prone by terrain problems. This includes that in future integration studies we should stop using some of the datasets from the ‘wild old times’ when we did not know better.\nad4: We need a strategy to communicate with data users that are far away from practical problems at the field sites. The amount of users without experience about possible problems related to terrain or technical limitations of eddy covariance will be dramatically increasing with open data policy, high performance computation and automated processing routines. The question arises how we can avoid misuse or misinterpretation of the data.",

This nomenclature does not necessarily imply functional isolation because these systems may exhibit a gradient of hydrologic, biological, or chemical connections to other surface waters. In this study, we examine the influence of GIWs on streamflow, a potential indicator of GIW hydrologic connectivity with surface waters. Our method involves the Spatial Stream Network (SSN) model, which considers spatial autocorrelation of model covariates explicitly, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which predicts streamflow across a network of 579 subbasins in the lower Neuse River Basin, North Carolina, USA. Our study results suggest that GIWs influence streamflow, though the effect is limited. The farther GIWs are from a stream, the greater their capacity to increase streamflow due to the physiographic setting and hypothesized connectivity, transit times and sequencing of watershed hydrologic connectivity in the study area across seasonal and annual scales. However, as the combined extent of GIWs and non-GIWs increases in subbasins, seasonal and annual streamflow decreases. Results also suggest that other landscape indicators of watershed-scale hydrology, when coupled with wetland features on the landscape, explain variations in seasonal and annual simulated streamflow. Our study findings begin to elucidate the aggregate influence of GIWs on streamflow, providing insights for future decision-making on GIW protection and management.",

It produced intense lightning, created enormous cloud disturbances and wrapped around the planet in 6 months. Six such storms, called Great White Spots, have erupted since 1876. They have alternated between mid-latitudes and the equator at intervals ranging from 20 to 30 years. The reason for the intermittent explosion is hitherto unclear and there are no similar storms on brother Jupiter. Here we describe the water-loading-mechanism, which could suppress moist convection for decades due to the larger molecular weight of water in a hydrogen-helium atmosphere. We show that this mechanism requires the deep water vapor mixing ratio to be greater than 1.0%. Observations imply that Saturn’s atmosphere is more enriched in water than Jupiter, which could explain why Saturn has such storms and Jupiter does not. We further use a two-dimensional axisymmetric dynamic model and a top-cooling convective adjustment scheme to connect our theory to observation. We show that for a deep water mixing ratio of 1.1%, the ammonia vapor is depleted down to 6 bars, the tropospheric warming is about 6 K, and the interval between two consecutive storms at one place is about 70 years. These values are confirmed by both ground-based and spacecraft observations.",

To properly characterize variability of precipitation at so-called \"weather\" versus \"climate\" time scales, we demonstrate a probabilistic method for representing daily precipitation within a stationary-climate (\"weather only\") framework with applications for constraining unrealistic precipitation variability in climate models. This method accurately recreates the annual seasonal cycle and the daily variability of precipitation conditioned on the previous m days of data in a generalization of an autoregressive process optimal for zero-inflated empirical probability distributions.\nMonte Carlo simulations from these models create \"weather\" distributions for a given location at any spatial scale, which can then be compared to observations to determine the magnitude of \"climate\" variability (i.e., variability not well-represented by our stationary models). Weather distributions have applications in characterizing forecast confidence intervals, and climate/weather variance ratios allow us to calculate potential predictability for precipitation. Techniques for empirical model selection and calibration are highlighted, as are common assumptions about precipitation stationarity and variability. As an application, the variability of precipitation at weather/climate time scales is compared for observational data and a collection of historical runs from Global Climate Models.",

Here we compare the following two algorithms which are frequently applied for analysis of the polar motion data, the classical discrete Fourier analysis and the maximum entropy method corresponding to the autoregressive modeling of the input time series. We start from general description of both methods and of their application to the analysis of the Earth orientation observations.

            "abstract": "The Penn State geoPebble system is a new network of wirelessly interconnected seismic and GPS sensor nodes with flexible architecture. This network will be used for studies of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, as well as to investigate mountain glaciers. The network will consist of ∼150 geoPebbles that can be deployed in a user-defined spatial geometry. We present our design methodology, which has enabled us to develop these state-of- the art sensors using commercial-off-the-shelf hardware combined with custom-designed hardware and software. Each geoPebble is a self- contained, wirelessly connected sensor for collecting seismic measurements and position information. Key elements of each node encompasses a three-component seismic recorder, which includes an amplifier, filter, and 24- bit analog-to-digital converter that can sample up to 10 kHz. Each unit also includes a microphone channel to record the ground-coupled airwave. The timing for each node is available from GPS measurements and a local precision oscillator that is conditioned by the GPS timing pulses. In addition, we record the carrier-phase measurement of the L1 GPS signal in order to determine location at sub-decimeter accuracy (relative to other geoPebbles within a few kilometers radius). Each geoPebble includes 16 GB of solid-state storage, wireless communications capability to a central supervisory unit, and auxiliary measurements capability (including tilt from accelerometers, absolute orientation from magnetometers and temperature).\nA novel aspect of the geoPebble is a wireless charging system for the internal battery (using inductive coupling techniques). The geoPebbles include all the sensors (geophones, GPS, microphone), communications (WiFi), and power (battery and charging) internally, so the geoPebble system can operate without any cabling connections (though we do provide an external connector so that different geophones can be used). We report initial field-deployment results and current efforts to test this new instrument system and how we are addressing the challenges imposed by the extreme weather conditions on the Antarctic continent. After fully validating its operational conditions, the geoPebble system will be available for NSF-sponsored glaciology research projects.",

            "abstract": "The coastal ocean accounts for about half of the global fish harvest, but is poorly resolved in global climate models (a one-degree grid barely sees the continental shelf). Moreover, coastal ocean circulation is strongly modified by river freshwater sources, often coming from estuarine systems that are completely unresolved in the coarse grid. River freshwater input in CESM is added in a practical but ad hoc way, by imposing a surface salinity sink over a region of the ocean approximating the plume area of a given river.\nHere we present results from a series of model experiments using a high-resolution (1.5 km) ROMS model of the NE Pacific, including the Columbia River and the inland waters of Puget Sound. The base model does multi-year hindcasts using the best available sources of atmospheric (MM5/WRF), ocean (NCOM), river (USGS), and tidal forcing. It has been heavily validated against observations of all sorts, and performs well, so it is an ideal test bed for downscaling experiments. The model framework also does biogeochemistry, including oxygen, and carbon chemistry is being added to make forecasts of Ocean Acidification.\nThis high-resolution ROMS model is systematically run in downscaling experiments for the year 2005 with combinations of CESM forcing (CAM, POP, and rivers) swapped in. Skill is calculated using observations. It is found that the runs with CESM forcing generally retain much of the skill of the base model. A compact metric of response to freshwater forcing is used, which is the mechanical energy required to destratify a shallow coastal volume. This, along with the average temperature and salinity of the volume, are used to characterize and compare runs, including the original CESM-POP fields. Finally the model is run with projected CESM simulation forcing at the end of 21st century based on a set of RCP scenarios, and the compact metrics are used to quantify differences from 2005.",

            "abstract": "Impact of climate change on the water resources of the United States exposes the vulnerability of feedstock-specific mandated fuel targets to extreme weather conditions that could become more frequent and intensify in the future. Consequently, a sustainable biofuel policy should consider a) how climate change would alter both water supply and demand and, b) in turn, how related changes in water availability will impact the production of biofuel crops and c) the environmental implications of large scale biofuel productions. Since, understanding the role of biofuels in the water cycle is key to understanding many of the environmental impacts of biofuels, the focus of this study is on modeling the rarely explored interactions between land use, climate change, water resources and the environment in future biofuel production systems to explore the impacts of the US biofuel policy and climate change on water and agricultural resources.\nMore specifically, this research will address changes in the water demand and availability, soil erosion and water quality driven by both climate change and biomass feedstock production in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. We used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model to analyze the water quantity and quality consequences of land use and land management related changes in cropping conditions (e.g. more use of marginal lands, greater residue harvest, increased yields), plus management practices due to biofuel crops to meet the RFS target on water quality and quantity. Results show that even if the Upper Mississippi River Basin is a region of low water stress, it contributes to high nutrient load in Gulf of Mexico through seasonal shifts in streamflow, changes in extreme high and low flow events, changes in loadings and transport of sediments and nutrients due to changes in precipitation patterns and intensity, changes in frequency of occurrence of floods and drought, early melting of snow and ice, increasing evaporation and changes in soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Slickwater high-volume hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as “fracking”) is highly controversial. So is global warming, and the two issues are closely related, but the natures of these two controversies have substantial and important differences. Building upon years of experience in teaching and developing resources and strategies for teaching about evolution and climate change, staff at the Paleontological Research Institution have engaged in public outreach and educator professional development to help nurture understanding of fracking and the broader energy system. How are these controversies similar to and different from one another, and how should understanding these similarities and differences inform educational programming (and about how you talk about these issues with your Uncle Fred at the family holiday dinner?).\nIt is nearly universally agreed amongst scientists who study climate that changes now underway are real and human caused, and are posing or likely to pose very serious problems for humanity. Scientists who study slickwater high-volume hydraulic fracturing agree that it causes environmental damage, but there is no consensus as to whether fracking causes more or less harm (e.g., among different kinds of environment harm, across different temporal and spatial scales, and among different social contexts) than other ways of producing energy on a large scale. In other words, the basic tenets of climate change are not a matter of scientific controversy, though the implications for policy making obviously remain politically controversial, while fracking is an issue of both scientific and political controversy. Without advocating for or against fracking, we help audiences disentangle scientific and political issues, better understand the energy resources used in their own communities, and consider issues of scale, systems, and complexity.\nWe will compare and contrast the overlapping controversies surrounding climate change and fracking and highlight effective and ineffective approaches for educational programming as well as for more personal discussions. We will draw attention to the important ways in which these topics differ and what that implies for the development of programming and resources for teaching.",

            "abstract": "At subduction zones, variations in fault zone seismic reflectivity provide key information about in situ physical properties. Commonly, negative polarity reflectors, which result from large impedance contrasts across the fault interface, are taken to indicate anomalously high porosity and pore fluid pressures. However, this idea has not been explored rigorously in the context of realistic sediment loading paths and consolidation behavior.\nWe use a forward model to quantify the effects of stress state and drainage conditions on fault zone reflection coefficient (R), focused on case studies from the Nankai and Costa Rican margins. We define constitutive relationships between: (1) stress state (mean and differential stress) and porosity (Φ); and (2) P-wave velocity (Vp) and Φ using data from triaxial laboratory consolidation experiments conducted on core samples. One key aspect of our approach is the consideration of differing stress states in the overriding wedge, which is likely to have experienced conditions at or near thrust failure, vs. the subducting sediment section, which likely undergoes uniaxial consolidation, at least in the near trench region.\nFor Costa Rica, the full range of pore pressure from hydrostatic to lithostatic yields negative values of R. Both the observation of decreased reflection amplitude beyond ~45 km from the trench and reported P-wave interval velocities in the subducting section are most consistent with modest overpressures (λ<~0.7). Decreased reflection amplitude landward of this point does not require the onset of drainage. Similarly, for Nankai, a wide range of pore fluid pressure conditions lead to negative values of R, because increased mean effective stress in the wedge leads to decreased Φ and higher Vp relative to the footwall. Positive polarity arises only if the underthrusting sediment transitions from a state of uniaxial compression to thrust failure, in combination with the onset of drainage - as might accompany décollement downstepping and duplexing. Our results show that fault reflectivity and its variation along-strike and downdip are unlikely to arise simply from variations in pore pressure. Future analyses should consider the role of stress state and sediment deformation properties in order to extract quantitative information from these signals.",

            "abstract": "Impact craters are among the few geologic features we have some confidence will be present in the Pluto/Charon system. Crater morphologies are important as tracers of thermal history (through the mechanism of viscous relaxation), and can be used to probe through icy crusts (in terms of excavating deeper layers as on Ganymede or penetrating through floating ice shells as on Europa). New Horizons will have the opportunity to examine crater morphologies on Pluto to resolutions <100 meters and on Charon to ~250 meters over significant areas. Stereo-derived topography maps are anticipated over 20-35% of each body. The first task will be to place the observed craters (assuming they are not deeply eroded) into Solar System context. Crater morphology on icy satellites is controlled primarily by surface gravity. Charon has similar surface gravity to the icy Saturnian satellites and we expect craters on Charon to resemble those seen by Cassini, where the dominant landform will be prominent central peaks. Pluto surface gravity is midway between Ganymede and Rhea. Triton, with similar surface gravity and internal composition to Pluto, is of no help due to the paucity of resolved craters there. This opens the possibility of observing landforms seen on Ganymede, such as central dome craters, palimpsests and perhaps even a multiring basin or two, albeit at larger diameters than we would see on Ganymede. Several issues complicate our rosy picture. A key unresolved concern is that impact velocities in the Pluto system are only a few km/s, in the low end of the hypervelocity range. Numerical models imply possible differences during excavation, producing deeper simple craters than on the icy satellites. Impacts occurring at velocities well below the mean (<< 2km/s) might produce shallower craters, complicating the issue further. Whether such differences are real and are significant enough to be detected in our anticipated topographic data sets is unclear. Any viscous relaxation (driven by internal or modest tidal heating) or mass wasting erosion (by volatile redistribution) will also work to reduce crater depths on Pluto in different ways, but cratering onto the likely cold interior of Charon may provide a reference standard by which to evaluate modified craters on Pluto.",

The Trinity River Restoration Program is now analyzing a 40 mile segment of the Trinity River to determine priority and implementation sequencing for its Phase II rehabilitation projects. A comprehensive approach and quantitative tool has recently been developed to analyze this complex river system referred to as: 2D-Hydrodynamic Based Logic Modeling (2D-HBLM). This tool utilizes various hydraulic output parameters combined with biological, ecological, and physical metrics at user-defined spatial scales. These metrics and their associated algorithms are the underpinnings of the 2D-HBLM habitat module used to evaluate geomorphic characteristics, riverine processes, and habitat complexity. The habitat metrics are further integrated into a comprehensive Logic Model framework to perform statistical analyses to assess project prioritization. The Logic Model will analyze various potential project sites by evaluating connectivity using principal component methods. The 2D-HBLM tool will help inform management and decision makers by using a quantitative process to optimize desired response variables with balancing important limiting factors in determining the highest priority locations within the river corridor to implement restoration projects. Effective river restoration prioritization starts with well-crafted goals that identify the biological objectives, address underlying causes of habitat change, and recognizes that social, economic, and land use limiting factors may constrain restoration options (Bechie et. al. 2008). Applying natural resources management actions, like restoration prioritization, is essential for successful project implementation (Conroy and Peterson, 2013). Evaluating tradeoffs and examining alternatives to improve fish habitat through optimization modeling is not just a trend but rather the scientific strategy by which management needs embrace and apply in its decision framework.",

            "abstract": "Numerous climate models, several parameters output from a vast range of climate scenarios -- most likely motivates a climate scientist to analyze a suite of available data to research and address a plethora of scientific questions, eg. occurrence of El Niño events or simply validate and compute specialized metrics for a specific climate field. Providing a platform for our scientists to work with data from different models both in-house and extending a similar approach to the application of climate analysis on data from different modeling centers is a key goal that will be addressed in this presentation.\nModel intercomparison projects, Earth System Grid Federation and knowledge exchange within the climate science community have all enabled successful establishment of “data standards and controlled vocabulary” . This opens key possibilities to facilitate techniques used to “explore” dataset(s) in the Big-Data archive and perform climate analyses following a simple, standardized templated approach.\nA typical pattern of use would be where the scientist works with a few datasets interactively to refine and extract a signal of a particular climate phenomenon. At this point data access patterns are random, as the analysis is exploratory. We call this the “inspiration-driven” phase of research. Subsequently, the scientist would need to apply her analysis to a much wider set of data: different models and scenarios from CMIP5 for example. This can be thought of as the “industrial” phase of research.\nWe provide a pathway for user-developed analyses to transition from inspiration to industry. We will illustrate techniques being adopted at GFDL to develop analysis through interactive computational exploration on selected data; Provide analysis capabilities in batch workflows (using: Flexible Runtime Environment) and also web-based with data exploration mechanisms tapped from GFDL’s Curator infrastructure. Comparing climate data both at the inter and intra-laboratory level, simplified by use of “unified analysis templates” and data standards.\nThis work was partly funded by the International ExArch project under the G8 initiative by NSF Award 1119308.

            "abstract": "Climate models predict increasing drought in Amazonian forests over the next century, and the synergy of drought and fire may lead to forest dieback. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) are two primary drivers of Amazonian drought, and each process has a spatially distinct manifestation in the Basin. Paleoecological reconstructions can contextualize the forest response to past drought periods. Stalagmite and lake sediment records have documented that the early- to mid-Holocene, i.e. 10,000 – 5000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), was among the driest periods of the last 100,000 years in western Amazonia. Climatic conditions became wetter and more similar to the modern climate over the last 4000 cal yr BP, and fires rarely occurred in the absence of human activity. Yet there are currently no drought and fire reconstructions that examine the spatially explicit patterns of drought during the Holocene. Here, we present regional drought histories from southwestern and northeastern sections Amazonia for the last 10,000 years that document the drought-fire dynamics resulting from both climatic processes.\nOur reconstructions were based on a compilation of dated soil charcoal fragments (N= 291) collected from within Amazonia sensu stricto, which were analyzed by region using summed probability analysis. The compiled soil charcoal dates contained limited evidence of fire over the last 10,000 years in some regions. Fire frequency rose markedly across the Basin, however, during the last 2000 years, indicating an increased human presence. Fire probabilities, and thus droughts, had similar increasing trajectories between southwestern and northeastern Amazonia from 1500-1100 cal yr BP, which decoupled from 1100-740 cal yr BP, and then regained synchronicity from 740-500 cal yr BP. Fire probability declined markedly after 500 yr cal BP, coincident with European arrival to the Americas. Native populations were decimated, and fire probabilities returned to similar levels before the rise 2000 years ago. These results suggested that the synergy of humans plus drought have played a large role in historical fire regimes in Amazonian forests for the last 2000 years.",

            "abstract": "An integrated approach incorporating multicomponent and classical solute geothermometry was used to evaluate its utility to estimate the temperature of the Bath geothermal reservoir, a low-enthalpy system on the island of Jamaica. Reservoir temperatures were estimated from (1) empirical geothermometric equations; (2) simulations of solute geothermometers using SolGeo software; (3) computations of saturation indices [Log(Q/K)] of reservoir minerals from full chemically-analyzed thermal water samples over a temperature range of 25-220°C in PHREEQC; and (4) the Giggenbach Na-K-Mg geothermometer. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows strong, positive correlations between Na+, K+, and Mg2+ and is regarded as significant for these ions in their reliance as useful reservoir geoindicators. However, a negative correlation exists between Na+, K+, Mg2+ and silica (SiO2). The more realistic estimates of the geothermal reservoir temperature were provided by the Na-K and Na-K-Mg geothermometers, whereas the Na-K-Ca geothermometer overestimated reservoir temperatures. Estimated geotemperatures from silica-quartz geothermometers were the lowest. The discrepancy in estimated geotemperatures may be due to processes such as boiling, degassing, dilution, rock dissolution, and mixing during the ascent of geothermal fluids. Log (Q/K) curves cluster over a range of equilibrium temperatures closest to Na-K and Na-K-Mg geothermometers at 80-102°C. Reservoir temperatures estimated for the Bath geothermal system range between 79-118°C. Comparisons of the estimated geotemperatures using the integrated approach to geothermometry show a favorable agreement. Based on the results of this investigation, the integrated geothermometric approach provided a more reliable approach to reconstruct the fluid composition at depth and estimate the geothermal reservoir temperature.",

            "abstract": "A multi-channel seismic reflection and wide-angle refraction seismic experiment was conducted on the Juan de Fuca (JdF) plate to investigate the evolution of the plate from accretion to its subduction at the Cascadia margin. Hydration of the upper crust (UC) of the JdF Plate is well documented, but the state of hydration of the lower crust (LC) and upper mantle (UM] remains to be investigated. A 2D P-wave velocity model of the plate is derived from a joint reflection-refraction travel-time inversion of wide-angle seismic data. Stacked MCS reflection images together with modeled sedimentary velocities define an increasing thickness of sedimentary cover of up to 2.7km. Evidence for bending-related faulting is identified in coincident MCS images both indirectly as faulting in the sedimentary layer [Gibson, et al., this meeting] and directly as dipping crustal reflectors [Han et al., this meeting]. Three first order features are evident in the patterns of crustal velocity variations along the profile. 1: Crustal velocities at 150-250 km landward of the spreading ridge (~5 Ma age) show reduced velocities up to -0.20 km/s in comparison to velocities in younger crust (~3 Ma) 100-150 km from the ridge. This decrease in velocities is coincident with a propagator wake. 2: Upper crustal velocities begin to increase at 170km from the deformation front (DF), which coincides with the first evidence of faulting from sedimentary offsets. Crustal velocities start a decreasing trend at 80km from the DF where fault throws are seen to begin increasing trend landward. 3: UC velocities in the region of directly imaged crustal faulting (40km from trench) increase ~0.5km/s at the DF, while LC velocities decrease ~0.3km/s. The contrasting behavior in the upper and lower crust may indicate that bending promotes hydrothermal circulation in the outer rise. Circulation may be vigorous enough within the sediments/UC so that any residual shallow porosity is clogged with alteration products faster than new porosity created by faulting, while in the LC new faults and cracks are the dominant process increasing porosity. We present estimates of porosity from ridge to trench at crustal and upper mantle levels by taking into account thermal effects on seismic velocity in order to place bounds on total and spatial distribution of water stored in the plate.",

Modern data management systems must be adaptable to heterogeneous science data formats, scalable to meet the mission’s quality of service requirements, and able to manage the life-cycle of any given science data product. Designing a scalable data management doesn’t happen overnight. It takes countless hours of refining, refactoring, retesting, and re-architecting. The Horizon data management and workflow framework, developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is a portable, scalable, and reusable framework for developing high-performance data management and product generation workflow systems to automate data capturing, data curation, and data analysis activities. The NASA’s Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)’s Data Management and Archive System (DMAS) is its core data infrastructure that handles capturing and distribution of hundreds of thousands of satellite observations each day around the clock. DMAS is an application of the Horizon framework. The NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)’s solution for making high-resolution global imageries available to the science communities. The Imagery Exchange (TIE), an application of the Horizon framework, is a core subsystem for GIBS responsible for data capturing and imagery generation automation to support the EOSDIS’ 12 distributed active archive centers and 17 Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS).

            "abstract": "Removing a forest to open new agricultural lands, which has been very intensive in countries like Brazil during the last decades, contributes to about 12% of the global anthropogenic emissions. Forest cover removal releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GEE) like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as a result of burning trees, followed by gradual decomposition of the forest biomass left on the ground while pasture or crop plantations are being established. In Brazil, the 2nd Brazilian National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) presents the mean annual net CO2 emissions caused by changes in land use (LUC) in each Brazilian biome and the first place in the ranking is occupied by the Amazon Rainforest Biome (860,874 Gg), followed by Savannah (302,715 Gg), Atlantic Forest (79,109 Gg), Caatinga (37,628 Gg), Pantanal (16,172 Gg) and Pampa (-102 Gg) (MCT 2010). Despite these results, the estimates of CO2 emissions caused by LUC in the Brazilian semiarid region (Caatinga) are very limited and scarce, and associated to uncertainties directly related to the estimated biomass in different types of vegetation which are spatially distributed within the biome, as well as the correct representation of the dynamics of the deforestation process itself, and the more accurate mapping use and land cover. Based on such facts, this project is estimating the emissions of the main greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O and CH4) caused by land use changes in an area of Caatinga biome in Pernambuco State through the model INPE-EM. So far, it is known that from decades of 1940 up to 1995, Caatinga biome has contributed with about 3.2 % to total land use change emissions in the country, and recently (1990-2005), the contributions of Caatinga are even higher (over 30%), according to the 2nd Brazilian National Communication (2010). By means means of the model INPE-EM (data still being acquired), we are trying to diminish the uncertainties and identify specific and integrated emissions of GHG, as well as the stocks and flows of C and N, in order to contribute to the current information about GEE dynamic in the Brazilian. Besides, the model will incorporate the temporal dynamics related to the deforestation process, and accounts for the biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity of the region in study.",

            "abstract": "Albedo is an important physical property of the land surface which influences the total amount of incoming solar radiation that is reflected back into space. It is a critical ecosystem service that helps regulate the Earth's energy balance and, in the context of climate mitigation, has been shown to have a strong influence on the overall effectiveness of land management schemes designed to counteract climate change. Previously, we demonstrated that incorporating the physical effects of albedo into an ecological economic forest model of locations in the White Mountain National Forest, in New Hampshire, USA, leads to a substantially shorter optimal rotation period for forest harvest than under a carbon- and timber-only approach. In this study, we investigate similar tradeoffs at 565 sites across the entire state of New Hampshire in a variety of different forest types, latitudes, and elevations. Additionally, we use a regression tree approach to calculate the influence of biogeochemical and physical factors on the optimal rotation period. Our results suggest that in many instances, incorporating albedo may lead to optimal rotation times approaching zero, or, perpetual clear-cut. Overall, the difference between growing season and winter-time albedo for forested and harvested states was the most significant variable influencing the rotation period, followed by timber stumpage price, and biomass growth rate. These results provide an initial understanding of tradeoffs amongst these three ecosystem services and provide guidance for forest managers as to the relative important properties of their forests when these three services are incentivized economically.",

            "abstract": "We use continuous GPS measurements from 31 stations in southern Mexico to model coseismic slip and postseismic deformation from the 20 March 2012 Mw=7.5 Ometepec earthquake, the first large thrust earthquake to occur below central Mexico during the modern GPS era. Coseismic offsets ranging from ~280 mm near the epicenter to 5 mm or less at sites far from the epicenter are fit best by a rupture focused between ~15 km and 35 km depth, consistent with an independent seismological estimate. Transient postseismic motion recorded by GPS sites as far as 300 km from the rupture has a different horizontal deformation gradient and opposite sense of vertical motion than do the coseismic offsets. A forward model of viscoelastic relaxation as a result of our new coseismic slip solution incorrectly predicts uplift in areas where postseismic subsidence was recorded and indicates that viscoelastic deformation was no more than a few percent of the measured postseismic deformation. The deformation within six months of the earthquake was thus strongly dominated by fault afterslip. The postseismic GPS time series are well fit as logarithmically decaying fault afterslip on an area of the subduction interface up to 10 times larger than the earthquake rupture zone, extending as far as 220 km inland. Afterslip had a cumulative geodetic moment of 2.0×1020 N·m, ~40% larger than the Ometepec earthquake. Tests for the shallow and deep limits for the afterslip require that it included much of the earthquake rupture zone as well as regions of the subduction interface where slow slip events and non-volcanic tremor have been recorded and areas even farther downdip on the flat interface. We examine whether aftershocks accommodated a significant fraction of the shallow postseismic slip, but find that the energy released by aftershocks accounted for no more than 10% of the postseismic moment release at any depth. Widespread afterslip below much of central Mexico suggests that most of the nearly flat subduction interface in this region is conditionally stable and thus contributes measurable transient deformation to large areas of Mexico south of and in the volcanic belt.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have highlighted ENSO as a key driver of the interannual variability of atmospheric CO2 growth rate (AGR) through its influence on the biospheric carbon cycle. The biophysical mechanisms leading to this influence remain unclear, however. Understanding and correctly representing those mechanisms would provide crucial diagnostic tools to improve predictions of future changes to the global carbon cycle.\nHere we analyze the correlation between annual AGR and the Nino 3.4 index during 1959-2010 to elucidate the response of the biospheric carbon cycle to ENSO. We further compare these results with the responses implied by 11 process-based models participating the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison project (MsTMIP). We find that the annual AGR is strongly correlated with the ENSO index during the preceding September to February, with stronger land CO2 sources following stronger El Nino signals. This response results from teleconnections between tropical temperatures and ENSO, as well as from the influence of tropical temperatures on the biospheric carbon cycle. MsTMIP models capture this correlation, but overestimate it. This is due to an unrealistically high sensitivity of simulated NEE to tropical precipitation. In particular, the response of AGR to ENSO becomes asymmetric under positive and negative phases of ENSO, with their correlation with ENSO index peaking at different times for post-El Nino and post-La Nina years. This asymmetric response is not captured by models, and the simulated responses for post-El Nino years are highly inconsistent across models as well as between models and AGR. Models therefore appear to have problems in simulating the biophysical mechanisms after El Nino years, mechanisms that are likely associated with anomalously dry conditions. As stronger and more frequent El Nino events are projected under climate change, these results suggest that model response to ENSO variability needs to be improved in order to robustly predict future climate-carbon interaction.",

Freshwater demands of vegetative communities are variable depending on the composition of the community. Hence, changes to community structure from production crop introductions, non-native species invasions, and climate change, may have significant implications for freshwater availability. Understanding how vegetative community changes impact freshwater availability will allow for better management and forecasting of limited freshwater supplies. To better understand these dynamics, we investigated three small tropical atolls in the Phoenix Island Protected Area, Kiribati. Despite their close proximity, these islands receive varying amounts of rainfall, are host to different plant communities and two of the islands have abandoned coconut plantations. Using electromagnetic induction, ground penetrating radar, soil samples, climate and satellite data, we present preliminary estimates of vegetative water demand for different tropical plant communities.",

We base model parameters primarily on the gravel-bedded middle Snake River near Marsing, Idaho. The heat budget is represented by an advection-dispersion-reaction equation with, in addition to radiative, evaporative, and sensible heat fluxes, a hyporheic flux term that models lateral flow from the main stream, through bars, and into alcoves and side channels. This term effectively introduces linear dispersion of water temperatures with respect to time, so that the magnitude of the hyporheic term in the heat budget is expected to scale with the ``hyporheic number,\" defined as , where is dimensionless hyporheic flow rate and is dimensionless mean residence time of water entering the hyporheic zone. Simulations varying the parameters for channel width and hyporheic flow indicate that, for a large river such as the middle Snake River, feasible changes in channel width would produce downstream changes in heat flux an order of magnitude larger than would relatively extreme changes in hyporheic number. Changes, such as reduced channel width and increased hyporheic number, that tend to reduce temperatures in the summer, when temperatures are increasing with time and downstream distance, actually tend to increase temperatures in the fall, when temperatures are decreasing with time and distance.",

SDR platforms, by definition, utilize a software-based interface for configuration in contrast to traditional, hard-wired platforms. In an effort to provide new and improved radar sensing capabilities, Penn State has been developing advanced instruments and technologies for future radars, with primary objectives of making such instruments more capable, portable, and more cost effective. This paper will describe the design and implementation of two low-cost radar systems and their deployment in ionospheric research at both low and mid-latitudes. One radar has been installed near Penn State campus, University Park, Pennsylvania (77.97°W, 40.70°N), to make continuous meteor observations and mid-latitude plasma irregularities. The second radar is being installed in Huancayo (12.05°S, -75.33°E), Peru, which is capable of detecting E and F region plasma irregularities as well as meteor reflections. In this paper, we examine and compare the diurnal and seasonal variability of specular, non- specular, and head-echoes collected with these two new radar systems and discuss sampling biases of each meteor observation technique. We report our current efforts to validate and calibrate these radar systems with other VHF radars such as Jicamarca and SOUSY. We also present the general characteristics of continuous measurements of E-region and F-region coherent echoes using these modern radar systems and compare them with coherent radar events observed at other geographic mid-latitude radar stations.",

            "abstract": "Among the biases in the tropical Pacific that are common in the climate models, two stand out. One is the excessive cold-tongue in the mean state---the pool of the cold water that is normally in the eastern tropical Pacific extends too far to the west. The other is the underestimate of the asymmetry of El Nino-Southern Oscillation—the fact that El Nino and La Nina are more or less a mirror image of each other in the models while they are not so in the observations. Results from an analysis from CMIP5 models, forced ocean GCM experiments, as well as an analytical model are presented to suggest that these two common biases in our state-of-the-art models are linked. Specifically, an excessive cold-tongue in the mean climatological state makes the ENSO system more stable and thus leads to a more symmetric ENSO, while a more symmetric ENSO in turn results in less nonlinear heating from the ENSO events to the cental equatorial Pacific which in turn contributes to the development of an excessive cold-tongue. The finding underscores that errors in the mean state and ENSO tend to reinforce each other and thus explains why it has been difficult to simulate the tropical Pacific climate. Further comparison with observations suggests that these two biases are the symptoms of a single structural inadequacy in the models: a weak dynamical coupling between the atmosphere and ocean which puts the ENSO system in the models to a different dynamic regime than the obsereved. Measures that may help push the models closer to the observations are suggested.",

            "abstract": "Surface albedo provides an important climate regulating ecosystem service, particularly in the mid-latitudes where seasonal snow cover influences surface radiation budgets. In the case of substantial seasonal snow cover, the influence of albedo can equal or surpass the climatic benefits of carbon sequestration from forest growth. Climate mitigation platforms should therefore consider albedo in their framework in order to integrate these two climatic services in an economic context for the effective design and implementation of forest management projects. Over the next century, the influence of surface albedo is projected to diminish under higher emissions scenarios due to an overall decrease in snow depth and duration of snow cover in the mid-latitudes. In this study, we focus on the change in economic value of winter albedo in the northeastern United States projected through 2100 using the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) a1 and b1 scenarios. Statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation are used as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to provide future daily snow depth fields through 2100. Using VIC projections of future snow depth, projected winter albedo fields over deforested lands were generated using an empirical logarithmic relationship between snow depth and albedo derived from a volunteer network of snow observers in New Hampshire over the period Nov 2011 through 2014. Our results show that greater reductions in snow depth and the number of winter days with snow cover in the a1 compared to the b1 scenario reduce wintertime albedo when forested lands are harvested. This result has implications on future trade-offs among albedo, carbon storage, and timber value that should be investigated in greater detail. The impacts of forest harvest on radiative forcing associated with energy redistribution (e.g., latent heat and surface roughness length) should also be considered in future work.",

Here we report combined SHRIMP chemical analyses and U-Pb geochronology on zircon from a suite of ten samples from depths of 26–148 mbsf in ODP Hole 894G, and one sample from IODP Hole U1415N.\nU-Pb zircon dating of gabbro, olivine gabbro, gabbronorite and olivine gabbronorite (1-10% oxide) collected from Hole 894G yield 230Th-corrected 206U/238Pb ages from 1.090 to 1.311 Ma with errors as low as 2.5%. In the uppermost 40 m of Hole 894G the one zircon-bearing sample yielded a date of 1.211±0.041Ma (MSWD =0.07). The next five sample dates from 50-100mbsf are older, with a weighted mean age of 1.281±0.019 Ma (MSWD=1.19). In the deepest section between 100-150 mbsf, two zircon-bearing samples have a weighted mean age of 1.234±0.050Ma (MSWD=3.5). These changes in zircon age (at ~40 and 100 mbsf) coincide with marked petrologic, textural and geochemical variations. Together with petrologic observations, these Pb/U dates define 3 macro-units, each tens of meters thick, showing no systematic pattern of age downhole. The range of zircon solidus dates implies this ~120m (true thickness) of fast spread crust was constructed over a protracted period of time (≥ 70ka), as thin pulses of magma emplaced randomly with depth, via a ‘piecemeal’ mode of crustal accretion.\nThe one sample of lower crust hosting zircon sampled from IODP Hole U1415N (olivine- and orthopyroxene-bearing gabbro w/ 0.5% oxide) yields a weighted mean solidus age of 1.321± 0.097Ma (MSWD 1.06).\nZircon chemistry is variable between samples downhole. Ti and Hf concentrations from spot analyses within individual samples range from tight clusters to linear trends of decreasing Ti with increasing Hf. Measured Ti concentrations in all zircon from 894G vary from 5 to 50 ppm (mean 23 ppm); calculated Ti-in-zircon temperatures vary by sample (Tmean= 783°; Tmax= 864°; Tmin =680°), with intrasample temperature ranges from 40-165°C (DTmean= 120°C). Zircons from U1415N have measured Ti concentrations of 19-50 ppm (calculated Tmean= 829°; Tmax= 966°; Tmin=777°; DT=189°C), consistent with the more primitive chemistry of this lower crustal sample.",

            "abstract": "Boulders can be found on many coastlines around the globe. They are generally thought to be moved either during coastal storms or tsunamis because they are too heavy to be moved by more common marine or coastal processes. To understand storm and tsunami risk at given coastline, the event histories of both events need to be separated to produce a robust event statistics for quantitative risk analyses. Because boulders are most likely only moved by coastal storms or tsunamis, they are very suitable to produce the data basis for such event statistics.\nBoulder transport problem has been approached by comparing the driving with resisting forces acting on a boulder. However, we argue that this approach is not sufficient because the comparison of resisting and driving forces only constitutes boulder motion, but not for boulder dislodgment. Boulder motion means that the boulder starts to move out of its pocket. However, this motion does not guarantee that the boulder will reach the critical dislodgment position. Boulder dislodgment is a necessary condition to identify whether or not a boulder has moved. For boulder dislodgement, an equation of motion is needed, and that equation is Newtons Second Law of Motion (NSL). We perform fully coupled three-dimensional numerical simulation of boulders moved by waves where the boulders move according to NSL.\nOur numerical simulations are the first of their kind applied to tsunami and storm boulder motion. They show how storm and tsunami waves interact with boulders in a more realistic physical setting, and highlight the importance of submergence. Based on our simulations we perform a dimensional analysis that identifies the Froude number as important parameter, which can be considered large only in the front of tsunami waves, but small in the rest of tsunami wave and also generally small in storm waves. From a general point of view, our results indicate that the boulder transport problem is more complex than recently considered, and more variables need to be considered in inversions of the wave characteristics from moved boulders. However, numerical simulations are an incredible powerful and flexible tool with which more robust and more correct techniques to invert wave characteristics from moved boulders can be developed. Our analyses of the Froude number and submergence are positive indicators.",

The main objectives of the mission are to gain more knowledge of the composition, the origin and formation of comets and the solar system.\nAfter extensive remote exploration of the comet the lander Philae will be separated to land on the comet surface, starting immediately examining its landing site with its scientific payload. Part of this payload is the APXS (Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer). It will measure in situ the chemical composition of the comet's surface and it's changes during the journey of the comet towards the sun. APXS is a combination of two spectrometers in one single instrument. It will irradiate the comet surface using Curium 244 sources, which are emitting alpha-particle and X-rays. In the alpha-mode the instrument uses alpha backscattering spectroscopy to detect lower Z elements like C, N and O and groups of elements with higher Z. In the X-ray mode alpha particle / X-ray induced X-ray spectroscopy (XRF) will allow the detection of most of the higher Z elements from Na up to Ni and above. Both modes will be always run in parallel allowing to determine lower and higher Z elements simultaneously.\nFor 3 years the solar powered Rosetta probe had to pass a hibernation phase because of a long passage far away to the sun. After wakeup in January 2014 an extensive test phase of all instruments and subsystems has been performed, including the APXS. After landing on the comet an intense initial measurement phase of all instruments is planned, the First Science Sequence (FSS). It will be followed by a long term science phase (LTS). As long as possible APXS and the other instruments will continue to measure and monitor the changes and increasing activity of the comet during its journey towards the inner region of the solar system.The project is funded by the German Space Agency DLR under contracts 50 QP 0404 and 50 QP 0902.\n",

This increase has been driven largely by synthetic fertilizer production and other perturbations to the global nitrogen cycle associated with human agriculture.

These studies have concluded that global N2O inventories such as EDGAR may be underestimating the true U.S. anthropogenic N2O source by a factor of 3 or more. However, simple back-of-the-envelope calculations show that emissions of this magnitude are difficult to reconcile with the basic constraints of the global N2O budget. Here, we explore some possible reasons why regional atmospheric inversions might overestimate the U.S. agricultural N2O source. First, the seasonality of N2O agricultural sources is not well known, but can have an important influence on inversion results, particularly when the inversions are based on data that are concentrated in the spring/summer growing season. Second, boundary conditions can strongly influence regional inversions but the boundary conditions used may not adequately account for remote influences on surface data such as the seasonal stratospheric influx of N2O-depleted air. We will present a set of forward model simulations, using the Community Land Model (CLM) and two atmospheric chemistry tracer transport models, MOZART and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), that examine the influence of terrestrial emissions and atmospheric chemistry and dynamics on atmospheric variability in N2O at U.S. and global monitoring sites.\n ",

            "abstract": "The environmental impact of coal mining and burning of coal is evident and generally easy to understand. However, students often struggle to understand the social impacts of coal mining. A jigsaw activity culminating in a mock town hall meeting helps students link social, economic and environmental impacts of coal mining. Students are divided into four groups and assigned the task of researching the environmental, social, economic or health impacts of coal mining in West Virginia. When students have completed the research, they are assigned a role for the town hall. Roles include local community members, direct employees of the coal industry, business owners from industries related to coal mining, and environmentalists. One student from each research area is assigned to each role, forcing students to consider environmental, social, health and economic aspects of coal mining in choosing an appropriate position for their role. Students have 30 minutes to prepare their positions and then present for 2-5 minutes in the simulated town hall. We then have open class discussion and review the positions. Finally, students are required to write a letter to the editor of the local paper. The specific topic for the town hall and letters can be varied based on current events and could include new regulations on power plants, mine safety, government funding of alternative energy supplies or a range of other topics. This approach forces students to consider all aspects of the issue. In addition, because students have to assume a role, they are more aware of the direct impact that coal mining has on individuals’ lives.",

            "abstract": "Particles in Saturn’s rings are engaged in a constant tug-of-war between interparticle gravitational and adhesive forces that lead to clumping, on the one hand, and Keplerian shear that inhibits accretion on the other. Depending on the surface mass density of the rings and the local orbital velocity, ephemeral clumps or self-gravity wakes can form, giving the rings granularity on the scale of the most-unstable length scale against gravitational collapse. The A ring and many regions of the B ring are dominated by self-gravity wakes with a typical radial wavelength of ~50-100 m. A characteristic of self-gravity wakes is that they can effectively shadow the relatively empty spaces in between them, depending on viewing geometry. This leads to geometry-dependent measurements of optical depth in occultations of the rings. The C ring and Cassini Division have significantly lower surface mass densities than the A and B ring such that in most of these regions the most-unstable wavelength is comparable to the size of the ring particles (~1 m) so that self-gravity wake formation is not expected nor have its characteristics in various measurements been observed. Here we present measurements of the optical depth of the C ring and Cassini Division with the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) showing variations with viewing geometry in the “ramp” regions and the Cassini Division “triple band”. These variations are characteristic of self-gravity wakes. We place limits on clumping in other regions of the C ring and Cassini Division.",

Based on the National Research Council (NRC) ‘Framework for K-12 Education,’ the NGSS are designed to provide all students with a coherent education possessing both robust content and rigorous practice. Within these standards is an enhanced emphasis on the intersection between science and engineering. The focus is not only on asking questions and finding answers (science) but also in identifying and designing solution to problems (engineering.) The NASA SMD (Science Mission Directorate) Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) Forums have been working with space scientists for many years to assist with their engagement in E/PO efforts, thus supporting the needs of previous science standards. In order to properly address the needs of NGSS, this conversation is being expanded to include engineers. Our initial efforts include a series of semi-structured interviews with a dozen engineers involved in different aspects of space science and mission development. We will present the responses from the survey and compare this information to our knowledge base about space scientists, their needs, attitudes, and understandings of E/PO. In addition to a new emphasis on engineering in the NGSS, we also consider engineering habits of mind such as systems thinking, creativity, optimism, collaboration, communication, and attention to ethical considerations as described by an NRC policy document for engineering education. Using the overall results, we will consider strategies, further ideas for investigation, and possible steps for going forward with this important aspect of including engineering in education and outreach programming.",

            "abstract": "Micro-scale modeling of multiphase flow in porous media is critical to characterize porous materials. Several modeling techniques have been implemented to date, but none can be used as a general strategy for all porous media applications due to challenges presented by non-smooth high-curvature and deformable solid surfaces, and by a wide range of pore sizes and porosities. Finite approaches like the finite volume method require a high quality, problem-dependent mesh, while particle-based approaches like the lattice Boltzmann require too many particles to achieve a stable meaningful solution. Both come at a large computational cost. Other methods such as pore network modeling (PNM) have been developed to accelerate the solution process by simplifying the solution domain, but so far a unique and straightforward methodology to implement PNM is lacking.\nPore topology method (PTM) is a new topologically consistent approach developed to simulate multiphase flow in porous media. The core of PTM is to reduce the complexity of the 3-D void space geometry by working with its medial surface as the solution domain. Medial surface is capable of capturing all the corners and surface curvatures in a porous structure, and therefore provides a topologically consistent representative geometry for porous structure. Despite the simplicity and low computational cost, PTM provides a fast and straightforward approach for micro-scale modeling of fluid flow in all types of porous media irrespective of their porosity and pore size distribution.\nIn our previous work, we developed a non-iterative fast medial surface finder algorithm to determine a voxel-wide medial surface of the void space of porous media as well as a set of simple rules to determine the capillary pressure-saturation curves for a porous system assuming quasi-static two-phase flow with a planar w-nw interface. Our simulation results for a highly porous fibrous material and polygonal capillary tubes were in excellent agreement with available experimental and analytical data.\nIn the current study, we expand the simulation rules to include phenomena such as interface merging at intersections, and converging/diverging flow paths. We also assess capabilities of PTM to compute the permeability of a porous system; and to simulate two-phase flow in swelling porous media.",

            "abstract": "As the footprint of our urban areas expands, so does our manipulation of the hydrology. For decades we have channeled runoff into storm sewers, wreaking havoc on downstream water bodies with pulses of polluted stormwater. Recently, there has been a push for 'green infrastructure' to replace this hard, grey infrastructure, where green infrastructure- from rain gardens to green roofs to restored riparian areas- would detain stormwater and promote pollutant removal, in addition to a plethora of other ecosystem services. Primarily, it has been landscape architects, engineers, and urban planners who have jumped on the green infrastructure bandwagon. I believe there is also a niche for hydrologists and biogeochemists in re-envisioning how we manage stormwater in urban areas. Developed areas may not be as enticing as a remote mountain field site and their hydrology may be a lot more complicated to model than that of a forest hillslope, but these areas are where the majority of people live and where we could have a great impact on informing better water management practices. In collaboration with more applied fields like landscape architecture and engineering, we can provide crucial insight on existing hydrology as well as how certain green infrastructure or other alternative considerations could support a more sustainable and resilient city, particularly in the face of climate change. Our knowledge on landscape hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycling- combined with the expertise of these other fields- can inform design of truly multi-functional green infrastructure that can effectively manage storm runoff in addition to providing wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, improved aesthetics, and even an opportunity to engage with citizens. While there are certainly some hydrologists that have recognized this opportunity, I hope to see many more pursuing research and seeking solutions for better management of water in urbanized areas.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical data has been used for many years to aid exploration of platinum group elements (PGE) in layered mafic intrusions, such as the Stillwater Complex, Montana. Using modern processing schemes we glean new information from legacy data sets which include a Fugro DIGHEM V airborne electromagnetic (AEM) and aeromagnetic survey along with ground-based gravity data. We apply a modern stochastic inversion to image the AEM data. Stochastic modeling utilizes statistics to provide parameter distributions, such as number of layers, and resistivity and thickness of each layer. A variety of modern filters were applied to the magnetic and gravity data.\nThe complex’s gravity high continues >25 km north of its outcrop indicating that the complex is larger than its surficial expression. Xenoliths of the complex in Cretaceous intrusions have been found 25 km to the North, confirming the gravity. The layers of the complex have been grouped into five series: Upper Banded (highest), Middle Banded, Lower Banded, Ultramafic, and Basal series (lowest). The PGE zone of interest, the J-M Reef, occurs as cumulate layers in the Lower Banded series. The aeromagnetic data clearly discerns layering, including the J-M Reef, within the complex due to varying amounts of serpentinized olivine. The aeromagnetic highs can be traced under cover and correlate with subvertical conductors in the AEM models. The complex’s resistivities are generally high, while the Reef’s resistivity is expected to be slightly lower due to higher serpentinized olivine content. Our inversions show the overlying sediments, serpentinized ultramafic rocks, and the Basal series to be conductive. Forward modeling suggests that the AEM data should not be able to resolve the Reef; however, significant amounts of olivine exist above and below indicating a potential Reef zone. By using the lab resistivity measurements from specific stratigraphic units and the resistivity distributions from the AEM models we aim to tease out variations within the Lower Banded series. Through the use of legacy data and modern processing and imaging techniques we are able to better characterize the geometry and composition of the Stillwater Complex — approaches that can be applied to other layered mafic intrusions.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a method for imaging the earthquake source dynamics through the inversion of ground motion records based on a parallel genetic algorithm. The source model follows an elliptical patch approach and uses the staggered-grid split-node method to model the earthquake dynamics. A statistical analysis is used to estimate uncertainties in both inverted and derived source parameters. Synthetic inversion tests reveal that the rupture speed (Vr), the rupture area and the stress drop (Δτ) are determined within an error of ~30%, ~12% and ~10%, respectively. In contrast, derived parameters such as the radiated energy (Er), the radiation efficiency (η) and the fracture energy (G) have larger uncertainties, around ~70%, ~40% and ~25%, respectively. We applied the method to the Mw6.5 intermediate-depth (62 km) normal-faulting earthquake of December 11, 2011 in Guerrero, Mexico (Diaz-Mojica et al., JGR, 2014). Inferred values of Δτ = 29.2±6.2 MPa and η = 0.26±0.1 are significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those of typical subduction thrust events. Fracture energy is large, so that more than 73% of the available potential energy for the dynamic process of faulting was deposited in the focal region (i.e., G = (14.4±3.5)x1014J), producing a slow rupture process (Vr/Vs = 0.47±0.09) despite the relatively-high energy radiation (Er = (0.54±0.31)x1015 J) and energy-moment ratio (Er/M0 = 5.7x10-5). It is interesting to point out that such a slow and inefficient rupture along with the large stress drop in a small focal region are features also observed in the 1994 deep Bolivian earthquake.",

As data volumes increase and community needs evolve, problems are typically solved with one-off solutions utilizing the methods and languages familiar to the senior staff, and often as not data remain organized as they had been prior to the adoption of modern operating systems and relational databases.\nWith data groups' data holdings approaching the complexity of Big Data, a realistic assessment of the influence of the origins of a data center on its current tools and procedures is necessary to design and implement new strategies and associated software utilities to curate these complex libraries of data in an efficient and interoperable manner.\nThis process of carefully identifying and reassessing the starting point and ultimate goals of the data center requires a continuing evolution of thinking, programming, networking, and archiving strategies; constantly evaluating and (when appropriate) utilizing the latest technologies and methodologies. This is the story of the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO), an unfinished tale of service to its research community, told from both a technical and human perspective.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the internally induced natural (unforced) variability of climate systems remains an outstanding scientific challenge especially for climate systems, which are far from equilibrium. Such systems are driven by internal non-linear processes, which make the evolution of this system transient. Transient behavior of the non-linear system is very sensitive to fluctuations and initial conditions. Therefore it is extremely difficult to predict future changes in such systems from observational data alone, since there is only one realization (of many possible transients) available. Our aim is to bring the methodology of non-equilibrium dynamics to bear on understanding the internally induced climate variability by modeling transient scenarios of climate change.\nIn this study, we consider the dynamics of the thermohaline circulation and the variations in the Earth’s temperature as examples of the transient scenarios. We study the evolution of the system whose parameters are near critical values - bifurcation points. The control parameter is a function of a time, and it evolves slowly through the critical value undergoing a dynamic bifurcation, that makes the system non-autonomous, its evolution is completely transient, and its dynamics is non-equilibrium. We assume the rate at which the control parameter crosses its critical value to be small compared to the response time of the system. We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system at different control parameter profiles (monotonic or periodic function, rate of change, initial values).\nOur results show that depending on the control parameters and its vicinity to the bifurcation points, the system may be closer or further away from equilibrium, may exhibit multiple equilibria, different kind of instabilities and oscillations around equilibria. In contrast to the scenarios with the time-independent parameters, non-equilibrium dynamics framework allows us to explicitly examine the transients and provide us with a diagnostic tool to reproduce the dynamics of observational data.",

            "abstract": "Two magmatic belts in Maine host essentially undeformed, well-preserved Silurian to Devonian volcanic sequences that include thick ash flow tuffs and rhyolitic lava flows. The Coastal Maine volcanic belt consists of at least five bimodal volcanic complexes (419 to 424 +/- 2 Ma) hosting volcanic sequences 1-4 km thick, spanning approximately 160 km of the Maine coastline. Entire cross-sections of the volcanic-plutonic complexes are visible, providing excellent sites to study the volcano/pluton interface. The Central Maine belt also extends approximately 160 km, northeast to southwest, across central Maine, and also hosts several bimodal plutonic/volcanic complexes. Rocks in the Central Maine belt range from 400 to 410 Ma (Hubacher and Lux, 1987; Bradley et al., 1996). The largest complex in the Central Maine belt is the ~407 Ma (Rankin and Tucker, 1995) Katahdin granite and Moxie mafic intrusive complex and the coeval Traveler Rhyolite, a monotonous two-member, 3200-meter-thick pyroclastic succession. In Rankin and Hon (1987), Hon argued that the original volume of the Traveler rhyolite was at least 5000 km3, making it one of the largest silicic caldera eruptions in the rock record. Both the Coastal Maine volcanic belt and the Central Maine belt are on the Gander terrane, a peri-Gondwanan crustal block that accreted to Laurentia during the Salinic orogeny. Accretion of the block was complete by ~421 Ma (Pollock et al., 2012), but by then the Avalon terrane was accreting to Gander. Either back-arc extension associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere on the leading edge of the Avalonian plate, or delamination of that plate beneath Gander resulted in back-arc extension, decompression melting of the mantle, and partial melting of thick crust. The Central Maine belt, farther inboard of the downgoing Avalonian slab, developed similar bimodal, extension-related magmatism by approximately 410 Ma. Large silicic caldera eruptions developed in these belts as a result of subduction of the Avalon plate beneath a thick Gander plate, production of dry, mantle-derived basalt in extensional settings, and sufficient crustal extension in the wide Gander terrane to permit transport of basaltic melt to shallow crustal levels, where it intruded large silicic magma chambers and initiated supervolcano-scale eruptions.",

Many questions need to be answered about the air pollution in China, such as how harmful is the air pollution, especially PM2.5? Why suddenly so many reports about sever air pollution, is the air in China getting more polluted? How to design a policy that can control the air pollution most efficiently?\nAfter updated the national Ambient Air Quality Standards in 2012 and included PM2.5 as one of the critical air pollutants, in 2013, Chinese central government released for the first time the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan”. The plan has set goals to reduce annual mean concentration of PM2.5 up to 25% in 2017 in different regions in China. If the ambitious goals were achieved, this could be the most significant air pollution reduction in such a short time that affects so many people in human history.\nTo achieve these goals, however, there are enormous scientific and public policy challenges to deal with. For example:\nIdentify the key components, size fraction of PM that have the largest health effects; and identify the sources of PM that has the most harmful effects on human health and ecosystem.\nReduce the uncertainty in health risk assessment.\nUnderstand complicate chemical transformation processes in air pollution formation with intensive emissions from industry, power plant, vehicles, agriculture.\nInteractions between air pollution, PBL, and atmospheric circulation at different scales.\nThe accountability, feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of air pollution control policies.\nIntegrate multi-pollutant control and achieve co-benefit with climate and energy policy.\nRegional coordinated air pollution control.\nThe largest challenge in China for air pollution control remains how to strength the link between science and policy.",

            "abstract": "The rapidly expanding use by the oil and gas industry of “nodal”, large channel capacity areal arrays that record continuously for extended periods of time is generating large volumes of data in excess of that needed for the conventional CMP reflection imaging that is the primary goal of such surveys. These excess data, once considered as simply “noise”, have recently been recognized to have utility not only for the exploration seismologist but also for addressing a diverse range of phenomena. The most widely recognized use for these “noise” records is surface wave tomographic imaging of near surface velocity structure via seismic interferometry of ambient natural noise. Such results are proving to be of great value in enhancing conventional 3D exploration imagery, but they should be appreciated in their own right for the information they provide on the shallow subsurface to the hydrologist, engineer and tectonicist. Another relatively dramatic application is the delineation of local structure by tracing the propagation of body and surface waves from local and teleseismic events across these dense arrays. Here I would like draw attention to three other promising uses for such data: a) detection and mapping of microseismicity below the detection thresholds of conventional earthquake monitoring networks, especially in areas of low conventional seismicity; b) reflection and refraction imaging of structure using cultural, as opposed to natural, energy sources, and c) systematic mapping of the basement in 3D using the existing exploration sources recorded at travel times longer than that typically harvested for resource purposes. We conclude by emphasizing that these potentially invaluable “extras” are now being recorded routinely around the world, but there is as yet no mechanism in place to ensure they are exploited rather than simply deleted.",

Of primary interest are the physical processes responsible for the fast electric field “characteristic” pulses that are often observed during this phase. The pulse widths of characteristic pulses are shown to occur as a superposed bimodal distribution, with the short and long modes having characteristic timescales on the order of 1 microsecond and 10 microseconds, respectively. Analysis of these pulses is based on comparison with laboratory observations of long spark discharge processes and with recently acquired high-speed video observations of a single –CG event. It will be argued that the fast electric field bimodal distribution is the result of conventional discharge processes operating in an extensive strong ambient electric field environment. An important related topic will also be discussed, where it will be argued that preliminary breakdown discharges are capable of generating energetic electrons and may therefore seed relativistic electron avalanches that go on to produce pulsed energetic photon emissions.",

            "abstract": "Skarns provide insight to the depth, longevity, and dominant fluid regime associated with Sierra Nevada plutonism and Mesozoic magmatism in the Mojave National Preserve, which represent different spatial and temporal exposures of the Mesozoic arc. Skarns from these regions may serve as proxies for intricacies in the fluid source, and have the potential to resolve magmatic flare-ups and relative depths of emplacement.\nBoth laser fluorination (LF) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) δ18O analyses of garnet from multiple Mojave (Lucerne valley) skarns indicate a strong, early influence of meteoric fluid despite the presence of relatively deep plutonism. LF data from individual whole garnets and garnet chips broken during sample preparation reveal variation from +4.2‰ to -8.8‰ (n = 24), with an average of approximately -4.0‰. The large spread in these LF data suggest that (A) δ18O reflects an average of varying δ18O (fluid) compositions spanning multiple garnet growth oscillations; or (B) multiple generations of garnets exist within individual skarns, the growth of each coinciding with changes in the hydrothermal source and composition.\nSIMS analysis of two individual Mojave skarn garnets with oscillatory zoning (seen in backscatter electron images) reveal crystal cores with δ18O values of -9.6‰, internal variations of -9.4‰ to -3.3‰, and crystal rims of -2.2‰ and -2.9‰ (precision ±0.3; 2σ). In general, δ18O values negatively correlate with andradite compositions, with high andradite zones having lower δ18O values ([AND + CaTi] compositions range from 100 to 73).\nSimilar analyses (both SIMS and LF) of garnets from Sierra Nevadan skarns (Tungsten Hills region) show variation in δ18O values with LF data ranging from 5.4‰ to 6.2‰ (n = 8), with an average of 5.7‰, and an additional 2.7‰ value obtained from a garnet interior. SIMS data show δ18O compositional variation from 4.0‰ to 5.9‰. Data across the two Tungsten Hills garnets analyzed via SIMS show the range of isotope compositions possible within a single crystal. All data from the Tungsten Hills skarns suggest meteoric water was less influential farther north in the arc, and that major skarn formation was likely the result of pluton-related magmatic fluids. Magmatic fluids would produce garnets with δ18O > +6‰.",

            "abstract": "The Brahmaputra River occupied the tectonically active Sylhet Basin in eastern Bangladesh three times during the Holocene. With samples from more than 200 closely-spaced (3-5 km) boreholes, we take advantage of these discrete channel occupations and the high trapping efficiency of the subsiding basin to investigate dispersal of fluvial sediments. Experiment and theory suggest that depositional units transition from channels to lobes as transported sediment mass declines below ~30% of the total measured at the basin head. We test these ideas by reconstructing the geometry and grain size distributions of a large (30 m thick x 80 km wide) sand lobe formed during the mid-Holocene occupation (~7000-4000 years BP) of Sylhet Basin. Based on estimates of modern sediment discharge in the system, the volume of this sediment lobe is insufficient to account for the entire sediment budget. The smaller sediment volume is likely a consequence of reduced sediment discharge during a weakened monsoon. Additional sediment is likely to have also been routed out of the basin via an outlet located approximately along the modern Meghna River channel. Facies within Sylhet Basin can be characterized as stacked braidbelt sands in the proximal portion of the system, with isolated sand lenses further downstream, indicating a transition from a highly mobile braidbelt to a less mobile distributary system. The majority of bed load is extracted within a distance of ~150 km from the avulsion node, approximately coincident with the regional backwater reach of the Bengal Basin, suggesting a link between the hydraulic and “morphodynamic” backwater reaches of the system. Downstream fining is more rapid in sediments associated with the long-term occupation of Sylhet Basin, for which sediment is trapped over a relatively short distance within the sand wedge of central Sylhet Basin, than those from the early- and late-Holocene occupations, for which sediment is distributed over a longer path that follows the course of the Old Brahmaputra River. Fine-grained sediments preserved in the system do not display measureable downstream fining. The increased rate of sediment extraction in the eastern part of the basin is likely coupled with a subsidence maximum (~7 mm/year) associated with the foredeep of the Dauki thrust fault.",

            "abstract": "Human activity in urban environments impacts climate from the local to the global scale by changing the atmospheric composition and impacting components of the water and energy cycles. Specifically land use and land cover change due to urban expansion changes the surface albedo, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity of the surface. Consequently, the energy balance in urban region is different from that of natural surfaces. In this research, we apply the coupled WRF-NOAH-UCM, which includes a detailed urban radiation scheme, to evaluate the changes in regional climate that would arise due to projected urbanization in the Phoenix-Tucson corridor, in Arizona. We use the land cover data for 2005 and projections to 2050 (for areas north to Tucson from Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) using the Red Dot Algorithm (RDA), and for areas around Tucson and South is from SLEUTH model) with historical North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data as the lateral boundary condition. Result shows that temperature changes are well defined and reflect the urban heat island (UHI) effect within the areas experiencing LULCC. The heat index is also examined, the magnitude of change is similar to that of temperature change. The timing of the maximum and minimum temperature is delayed by approximately one hour. Precipitation was analyzed according to both the occurrence of rainfall and according to flow regime, however no clear evidence of changes in precipitation amount or occurrence was found due to urbanization.",

            "abstract": "River avulsions and earthquakes can be hazardous events, and many researchers work to better understand and predict their timescales. Improvements in the understanding of the intrinsic processes of deposition and strain accumulation that lead to these events have resulted in better constraints on the timescales of each process individually. There are however several mechanisms by which these two systems may plausibly become linked. River deposition and avulsion can affect the stress on underlying faults through differential loading by sediment or water. Conversely, earthquakes can affect river avulsion patterns through altering the topography. These interactions may alter the event recurrence timescales, but this dynamic has not yet been explored. We present results of a simple numerical model, in which two systems have intrinsic rates of approach to failure thresholds, but the state of one system contributes to the other’s approach to failure through coupling functions. The model is first explored for the simplest case of two linear approaches to failure, and linearly proportional coupling terms. Intriguing coupling dynamics emerge: the system settles into cycles of repeating earthquake and avulsion timescales, which are approached at an exponential decay rate that depends on the coupling terms. The ratio of the number of events of each type and the timescale values also depend on the coupling coefficients and the threshold values. We then adapt the model to a more complex and realistic scenario, in which a river avulses between either side of a fault, with parameters corresponding to the Brahmaputra River / Dauki fault system in Bangladesh. Here the tectonic activity alters the topography by gradually subsiding during the interseismic time, and abruptly increasing during an earthquake. The river strengthens the fault by sediment loading when in one path, and weakens it when in the other. We show this coupling can significantly affect earthquake and avulsion recurrence times. We also find a significant probability of event co-occurrence, where avulsions are induced by earthquakes. This model sets up a framework for the study of earthquakes and avulsions as a coupled dynamical system, and shows the importance of understanding this dynamic for prediction of hazard recurrence intervals.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, bark beetle infestation in western North America has reached epidemic levels. The resulting widespread forest mortality may have profound effects on present and future water and carbon cycling with potential negative consequences to a region that relies on water from montane and subalpine watersheds. We simulated stand-level ecosystem fluxes of water and carbon at two bark beetle-attacked conifer forests in southeast Wyoming, USA. The lower elevation site dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) was attacked by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) during 2008-2010. The high elevation Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) dominated site was attacked by the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) during roughly the same time period. Both beetle infestations resulted in >60% canopy mortality in the footprint of eddy covariance towers located at each site. However, carbon and water fluxes responses to mortality depended on the forest type. Using data collected at the sites, we scaled simulated plant hydraulic conductivity by either percent canopy mortality or loss of live tree basal area during infestation. We also simulated a case of no beetle attack. At the lodgepole site, the no-beetle model best fit the data and showed no significant change in growing season carbon flux and a 15% decrease in evapotranspiration (ET). However, at the spruce site, the simulation that tracked canopy loss agreed best with observations: carbon flux decreased by 72% and ET decreased by 31%. In the lodgepole stand, simulated soil water content agreed with spatially distributed measurements that were weighted to reflect overall mortality in the tower footprint. Although these two forest ecosystems are only 20 km apart, separated by less than 300m in elevation, and have been impacted by similar mortality agents, the associated changes in carbon and water cycling are significantly different. Beetle effects on hydrologic cycling were greatest at high elevation due to slow succession, which is the predominant regional water source from higher snowpack amounts. The surprising lack of bark beetle impacts at the lodgepole pine site may be due to faster than expected succession as suggested by vegetation measurements.",

            "abstract": "Super Typhoon (STY) Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds of 315 kph producing a 7+ meter storm surge that inundated parts of Leyte and Samar; >8000 died, > 106 homes were destroyed, and thousands of people are still missing. The surge reached 1 km inland and resulted in widespread seawater (SW) contamination of groundwater (GW) resources critical for coastal villages.\nWe conducted field-work in a village of ~2200 residents, inundated by a 5-6 m surge, 2 months and again 8 months after STY Haiyan. The 330+ shallow tube wells (STWs) had been drilled through beach sand into karstic reef carbonates to 5-20m below the water table (WT). Residents reported their STWs salinized immediately after the storm, even the deepest wells, and the only source of fresh water was a karst spring 1 km from the village. 2 months after the storm GW salinity was up to 18% SW. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was used to image salt distribution in the surficial aquifer alongside the developed village. ERT detected an electrically conductive layer ~1m below the WT, and water sampling confirmed that this was due to infiltrated seawater. Variable-density flow and transport models corroborate the ER tomograms and show that the salt is infiltrating through the aquifer and slowly flushing to the ocean.\nWe hypothesize that SW rapidly infiltrated the ~2m sandy unsaturated zone and contaminated the shallow GW over a wide area. This salt layer is slowly sinking and flushing toward the ocean, and flow models show that it might be several years to flush the system. Results from a second ERT survey 6 months later show little change in the ER field, consistent with model predictions. But karst features and the STWs themselves served as preferential paths into the aquifer for SW injection to the deeper zone under the 6m surge potential, salinizing deep wells ahead of the advancing shallow SW layer. These wells have seen substantial decrease in salinity over 6 months, as much as 75%, with many approaching acceptable drinking water criteria (TDS<600ppm, WHO). We hypothesize that the deep-injected SW is being quickly flushed out by the coastward flow of fresh GW, enhanced by primary and secondary porosity in the carbonate aquifer. It is unclear however if the slowly sinking shallow layer of salt will contaminate STWs in the future.",

            "abstract": "Particularly in polar regions, photochemical reactions in snowpacks can be an important mechanism for transforming organic and inorganic compounds. Chemicals within snow and ice are found in three different compartments: distributed in the bulk ice, concentrated in liquid-like regions (LLRs) within the ice matrix (such as at grain boundaries), or in quasi-liquid layers at the air-ice interface. While some experiments suggest reaction rates may vary in these different compartments, it is not clear if the reaction rates are different or if the changes are due to variations in the reaction environment (such as photon flux). A companion presentation discusses our work identifying solute location in laboratory ice samples; here, we describe experimental measurements of reaction rates in different ice compartments.\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are common pollutants in snow and ice. We first prepared aqueous solutions of a single PAH. We then froze these samples using various methods that segregate the solute into different locations in the ice matrix. With simulated sunlight, we illuminated these samples and measured photon flux (using 2-nitrobenzaldehyde) and the photodecay of the PAH. We will discuss differences in PAH photochemistry as a function of location in the ice sample and the implications of these results for environmental snow and ice.",

SHERLOC enables non-contact, spatially resolved, and highly sensitivity detection and characterization of organics and minerals in the Martian surface and near subsurface. SHERLOC is an arm-mounted, Deep UV (DUV) resonance Raman and fluorescence spectrometer utilizing a 248.6-nm DUV laser and 50 micron spot size. The laser is integrated to an autofocusing/scanning optical system, and co-boresighted to a context imager with a spatial resolution of 30 µm. SHERLOC operates over a 7 × 7 mm area through use of an internal scanning mirror. The 500 micron depth of view in conjunction with the MAHLI heritage autofocus mechanisms enables arm placements from 48 ±12.5 mm above natural or abraded surfaces without the need for rover arm repositioning/movement. Additionally, borehole interiors to a depth of ~25 mm, at angles from normal incidence to ±20 degrees, can be analyzed.\nDeep UV induced native fluorescence is very sensitive to condensed carbon and aromatic organics, enabling detection at or below 10-6 w/w (1 ppm) at <100 µm spatial scales. SHERLOC’s deep UV resonance Raman enables detection and classification of aromatic and aliphatic organics with sensitivities of 10-2 to below 10-4 w/w at <50 µm spatial scales. In addition to organics, the deep UV Raman enables detection and classification of minerals relevant to aqueous chemistry with grain sizes below 20 µm grains.\nThe instrument goals are to assess past aqueous history, detect the presence and preservation of potential biosignatures, and to support selection of return samples. To do this, SHERLOC will measure CHNOPS-containing mineralogy, measure the distribution and type of organics preserved at the surface, and correlate them to textural features.",

Because p- and s-waves respectively travel faster and slower in the direction of an ice crystal c-axis, the velocities of these waves in a fabric are related to the clustering of ice crystal c-axes in the direction of wave propagation. Previous sonic logs at Dome C, NGRIP, WAIS, and NEEM have inferred a single component fabric description from the velocities of vertically-propagating p-waves around each ice core borehole. These records supplement thin-section measurements of crystal fabric by sampling larger numbers of crystals in a depth-continuous log.\nObservations of azimuthally anisotropic vertical-girdle fabrics at ice-core sites such as WAIS, NGRIP, and EDML underly a benefit for logging methods that are sensitive to such fabrics. We present a theoretical framework for using borehole flexural modes to measure azimuthal crystal-fabric anisotropy, and describe ongoing efforts to develop a sonic logging tool for this purpose. We also present data from p-wave logs and thin section measurements at the WAIS Divide, and describe how a flexural wave log could supplement the existing measurements.",

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have been released and are now being adopted by states (a dozen states and Washington, DC, at the time of writing this), with dramatic implications for national K-12 science education. Curriculum developers and textbook companies are working hard to construct educational materials that match the new standards, which emphasize a hands-on practice-based approach that focuses on working directly with primary data and other forms of evidence. While the set of 8 science and engineering practices of the NGSS lend themselves well to the observation-oriented approach of much of the geosciences, there is currently not a sufficient number of geoscience educational modules and activities geared toward the K-12 levels, and geoscience research organizations need to be mobilizing their education & outreach programs to meet this need. It is a rare opportunity that will not come again in this generation. There are other significant issues surrounding the implementation of the NGSS. The NGSS involves a year of Earth and space science at the high school level, but there does not exist a sufficient workforce is geoscience teachers to meet this need. The form and content of the geoscience standards are also very different from past standards, moving away from a memorization and categorization approach and toward a complex Earth Systems Science approach. Combined with the shift toward practice-based teaching, this means that significant professional development will therefore be required for the existing K-12 geoscience education workforce. How the NGSS are to be assessed is another significant question, with an NRC report providing some guidance but leaving many questions unanswered. There is also an uneasy relationship between the NGSS and the Common Core of math and English, and the recent push-back against the Common Core in many states may impact the implementation of the NGSS.",

The initiative partners NASA science education programs with public libraries to provide NASA-themed hands-on education activities for girls and their families. These NASA science education programs are mission- and grant-based E/PO programs are uniquely poised to foster collaboration between scientists with content expertise and educators with pedagogy expertise. As such, the initiative engages girls in all four NASA science discipline areas (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Planetary Science, and Heliophysics), which enables audiences to experience the full range of NASA science topics and the different career skills each requires. The events focus on engaging underserved and underrepresented audiences in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) via use of research-based best practices, collaborations with libraries, partnerships with local and national organizations, and remote engagement of audiences.",

            "abstract": "The increasing extent and vulnerability of technologically advanced society together with aspects of global climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Every year, communities around the world face the devastating consequences of hazardous events, including loss of life, property and infrastructure damage, and environmental decline. Environmentally sound strategies have to be developed to minimize these consequences. However, hazard-prone areas differ geographically, climatically, and culturally. There is no a one-size-fits-all solution. Thus, it is crucial that future decision-makers not only know the conditions that make some natural Earth processes hazardous to people, but also understand how people perceive and adjust to potential natural hazards in their regions. In May 2013, an ice jam caused major flooding in Galena, a remote village in interior Alaska. Within two days, flooding destroyed nearly the entire region’s infrastructure, and displaced over 400 residents. Almost a year later, a significant part of Galena’s population was still evacuated in Fairbanks and other neighboring towns. The rebuilding holdup reflected the federal government’s reluctance to spend millions of dollars an the area that may be destroyed again by the next flood. Massive floods inundated towns along the Yukon River before (e.g., Eagle in 2009 and Holycross in 1975), but people return to refurbish and again inhabit the same territories. Rivers have a significant importance to Alaskan rural communities. Not only do rivers provide food, drink, transportation, and in some cases arable land and irrigation, but they also carry cultural significance for the Native Alaskan people. The Galena case study provides a revealing example of challenges of communicating with and educating the public and policy makers about natural hazards.",

            "abstract": "This poster will introduce and explore the various social media efforts and monthly webinar series recently established by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) project. EOSDIS is a key core capability in NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems Program. It provides end-to-end capabilities for managing NASA’s Earth science data from various sources – satellites, aircraft, field measurements, and various other programs. Some of the capabilities include twelve Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), Science Computing Facilities (SCFs), a data discovery and service access client (Reverb), dataset directory (Global Change Master Directory - GCMD), near real-time data (Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS - LANCE), Worldview (an imagery visualization interface), Global Imagery Browse Services, the Earthdata Code Collaborative, and a host of other discipline specific data discovery, data access, data subsetting and visualization tools and services. We have embarked on these efforts to reach out to new audiences and potential new users and to engage our diverse end user communities world-wide. One of the key objectives is to increase awareness of the breadth of Earth science data information, services, and tools that are publicly available while also highlighting how these data and technologies enable scientific research.",

            "abstract": "Interoperable sharing of groundwater data across international boarders is essential for the proper management of global water resources. However storage and management of groundwater data is often times distributed across many agencies or organizations. Furthermore these data may be represented in disparate proprietary formats, posing a significant challenge for integration. For this reason standard data models are required to achieve interoperability across geographical and political boundaries.\nThe GroundWater Markup Language 1.0 (GWML1) was developed in 2010 as an extension of the Geography Markup Language (GML) in order to support groundwater data exchange within Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). In 2013, development of GWML2 was initiated under the sponsorship of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for intended adoption by the international community as the authoritative standard for the transfer of groundwater feature data, including data about water wells, aquifers, and related entities. GWML2 harmonizes GWML1 and the EU's INSPIRE models related to geology and hydrogeology. Additionally, an interoperability experiment was initiated to test the model for commercial, technical, scientific, and policy use cases.\nThe scientific use case focuses on the delivery of data required for input into computational flow modeling software used to determine the flow of groundwater within a particular aquifer system. It involves the delivery of properties associated with hydrogeologic units, observations related to those units, and information about the related aquifers. To test this use case web services are being implemented using GWML2 and WaterML2, which is the authoritative standard for water time series observations, in order to serve USGS water well and hydrogeologic data via standard OGC protocols. Furthermore, integration of these data into a computational groundwater flow model will be tested. This submission will present the GWML2 information model and results of an interoperability experiment with a particular emphasis on the scientific use case.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem models play a critical role in understanding the terrestrial biosphere and forecasting changes in the carbon cycle, however current forecasts have considerable uncertainty. The amount of data being collected and produced is increasing on daily basis as we enter the “big data” era, but only a fraction of this data is being used to constrain models. Until we can improve the problems of model accessibility and model–data communication, none of these resources can be used to their full potential.\nThe Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is an ecoinformatics toolbox and a set of workflows that wrap around an ecosystem model and manage the flow of information in and out of regional-scale TBMs. Here we present new modules developed in PEcAn to manage the processing of meteorological data, one of the primary driver dependencies for ecosystem models. The module downloads, reads, extracts, and converts meteorological observations to Unidata Climate Forecast (CF) NetCDF community standard, a convention used for most climate forecast and weather models. The module also automates the conversion from NetCDF to model specific formats, including basic merging, gap-filling, and downscaling procedures. PEcAn currently supports tower-based micrometeorological observations at Ameriflux and FluxNET sites, site-level CSV-formatted data, and regional and global reanalysis products such as the North American Regional Reanalysis and CRU-NCEP. The workflow is easily extensible to additional products and processing algorithms.\nThese meteorological workflows have been coupled with the PEcAn web interface and now allow anyone to run multiple ecosystem models for any location on the Earth by simply clicking on an intuitive Google-map based interface. This will allow users to more readily compare models to observations at those sites, leading to better calibration and validation. Current work is extending these workflows to also process field, remotely-sensed, and historical observations of vegetation composition and structure. The processing of heterogeneous met and veg data within PEcAn is made possible using the Brown Dog cyberinfrastructure tools for unstructured data.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization over the last century has degraded our natural water resources by increasing storm-water runoff, reducing nutrient retention, and creating poor ecosystem health downstream. The loss of tree canopy and expansion of impervious area and storm sewer systems have significantly decreased infiltration and evapotranspiration, increased stream-flow velocities, and increased flood risk. These problems have brought increasing attention to catchment-wide implementation of green infrastructure (e.g., decentralized green storm water management practices such as bioswales, rain gardens, permeable pavements, tree box filters, cisterns, urban wetlands, urban forests, stream buffers, and green roofs) to replace or supplement conventional storm water management practices and create more sustainable urban water systems. Current green infrastructure (GI) practice aims at mitigating the negative effects of urbanization by restoring pre-development hydrology and ultimately addressing water quality issues at an urban catchment scale. \nThe benefits of green infrastructure extend well beyond local storm water management, as urban green spaces are also major contributors to human health. Considerable research in the psychological sciences have shown significant human health benefits from appropriately designed green spaces, yet impacts on human wellbeing have not yet been formally considered in GI design frameworks. This research is developing a novel computational green infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates hydrologic requirements with criteria for human wellbeing. A supervised machine learning model is created to identify specific patterns in urban green spaces that promote human wellbeing; the model is linked to RHESSYS model to evaluate GI designs in terms of both hydrologic and human health benefits. An application of the models to Dead Run Watershed in Baltimore showed that image mining methods were able to capture key elements of human preferences that could improve tree-based GI design. Hydrologic benefits associated with these features were substantial, indicating that increased urban tree coverage and a more integrated GI design approach can significantly increase both human and hydrologic benefits.

            "abstract": "In many ecosystems, nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth and productivity. However mechanistic representation of nitrogen uptake linked to root traits, and functional nitrogen allocation among different leaf enzymes involved in respiration and photosynthesis is currently lacking in Earth System models.\nThe linkage between nitrogen availability and plant productivity is simplistically represented by potential photosynthesis rates, and is subsequently downregulated depending on nitrogen supply and other nitrogen consumers in the model (e.g., nitrification). This type of potential photosynthesis rate calculation is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, plants do not photosynthesize at potential rates and then downregulate. Secondly, there is considerable subjectivity on the meaning of potential photosynthesis rates. Thirdly, there exists lack of understanding on modeling these potential photosynthesis rates in a changing climate. In addition to model structural issues in representing photosynthesis rates, the role of plant roots in nutrient acquisition have been largely ignored in Earth System models. For example, in CLM4.5, nitrogen uptake is linked to leaf level processes (e.g., primarily productivity) rather than root scale process involved in nitrogen uptake.\nWe present a new plant model for CLM with an improved mechanistic presentation of plant nitrogen uptake based on root scale Michaelis Menten kinetics, and stronger linkages between leaf nitrogen and plant productivity by inferring relationships observed in global databases of plant traits (including the TRY database and several individual studies). We also incorporate improved representation of plant nitrogen leaf allocation, especially in tropical regions where significant over-prediction of plant growth and productivity in CLM4.5 simulations exist. We evaluate our improved global model simulations using the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) framework. We conclude that mechanistic representation of leaf-level nitrogen allocation and a theoretically consistent treatment of competition with belowground consumers leads to overall improvements in CLM4.5’s global carbon cycling predictions.",

            "abstract": "Using landslide morphology to determine the state of hillslope transience provides a diagnostic tool to identify the extent of landscape adjustment. Here we test for a temporal and spatial progression of landslides reflecting the degree of adjustment for a Waipaoa River catchment (North Island, New Zealand). Following the shift to a warmer, wetter climate after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (~18 ka), the Waipaoa River rapidly incised up to 120 m, leaving perched, low-relief hillslopes unadjusted to that base level fall. In the 16 km2 study catchment—principally comprised of weak mélange—pervasive post-LGM landslides responded to >50 m of fluvial incision by sculpting and denuding >99% of the catchment, but adjustment is not yet complete. Starting ~150 years ago, European settlers deforested ~95% of the landscape, which triggered a sharp increase in hillslope erosion as widespread earthflow complexes and gully systems reactivated and/or expanded in the weak lithology with the loss of vegetation cover. Most of the remaining relict (≥18 ka) landforms are confined to the upper watershed, upholding the proposed upstream progression of hillslope adjustment. Based on previous tephrochronology and surface roughness data, present-day earthflows follow this pattern of younging upstream. Here we analyze the size, location, and distribution of ~500 earthflows (mapped from 2010 lidar and orthophotos) to determine if there is a spatial progression of earthflows reflective of hillslope adjustment and correlated to the previously identified temporal progression. Morphologic evidence from this study indicates the younger earthflows in the upper watershed have smaller areas (6000 ± 600 m2 (mean ± s.e.)), a more elongate aspect ratio (AR=3.6 ± 1.6 (mean ± s.d.)), and are generally (>50%) deposited in axial gullies, whereas downstream earthflows are larger (20000 ± 9000 m2), statistically less elongate (AR=2.3 ± 0.9), and more frequently coupled with the main channel—in two cases, encompassing the entire sub-catchments. We suggest this difference in form is not necessarily reflective of activity, but rather a diagnostic indicator of relative age and progression of earthflow development.",

            "abstract": "The amplitude of tropical paleotemperature variability on glacial/interglacial time scales has been hotly debated for decades, as sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions from the tropics have repeatedly shown less warming than reconstructions from high elevations from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present. This debate is complicated by the fact that SST and high elevation reconstructions rely on different proxies, which inherently contain different errors and assumptions. Here we present a new equatorial paleotemperature record from Lake Rutundu, Mt. Kenya (3081 m above sea level) based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and compare it to previously published East African GDGT temperature reconstructions at different elevations to assess the timing and amplitude of temperature changes with altitude. We find that the overall amplitude of warming in the Lake Rutundu record is 6.8±1.0°C from the LGM to the present, with mid-Holocene temperatures 1.6±0.9°C warmer than modern.\nBy combining our Lake Rutundu record with three previously published GDGT temperature records from different elevations in East Africa (Sacred Lake, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Malawi), we can calculate changes in lapse rates and freezing level heights (FLHs) through time. We find that lapse rates were steeper at the LGM (-7.4ºC/km) compared to the modern (-6.1ºC/km), likely due to widespread regional aridity at the LGM. FLHs were nearly 1000 m lower than they are today, which is supported by regional equilibrium line altitude (ELA) reconstructions from East African moraines. Patterns of altitudinal temperature variability and lapse rate changes reflect those from the TraCE-21 paleoclimate model, but amplitudes of model data variability are much smaller.",

VISL will allow users to perform guided experiments using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a state-of-the-art ice flow model developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UC Irvine that simulates the near-term evolution of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. VISL users will access ISSM via a graphical interface that can be launched from a web browser on a computer, tablet or smart phone. Users select climate conditions and run time by moving graphic sliders then watch how a given region evolves in time under those conditions. Lesson plans will include conceptual background, instructions for table top experiments related to the concepts addressed in a given lesson, and a guide for performing model experiments and interpreting their results. Activities with different degrees of complexity will aim for consistency with NGSS Physical Science criteria for different grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12), although they will not be labeled as such to encourage a broad user base. Activities will emphasize the development of physical intuition and critical thinking skills, understanding conceptual and computational models, as well as observation recording, concept articulation, hypothesis formulation and testing, and mathematical analysis.

A truly unique diamondiferous garnet-peridotite xenolith was recovered, consisting of equal amounts of enstatite (Mg# 92.7) and lherzolitic garnet (Mg# 83.8), with lesser unaltered olivine (Mg# 92-95). High-Resolution X-ray Computerized Tomography (HRXCT) of this strange xenolith produced numerous 2-D and 3-D images, revealing detailed relationship between the diamonds and the host minerals. The modal abundances of the minerals are: diamonds (9.5 vol%); enstatite (38 vol%); pyrope (35 vol%); sulfides (4 vol%; pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite); and the remainder being mainly alteration products, consisting of “spinach” – probably serpentine – mostly in the interior of the peridotite, along with the majority of the diamonds. This 10.5 g peridotite contains >30,000 colorless, all euhedral, octahedral micro-diamonds, with sizes of 100 to 700 mm, many occurring in clusters. This is the absolute highest-yield of diamonds ever in a mantle xenolith – 106 cts/tonne – but tiny Ds.\nThe δ13C isotopic composition in these crystals has a value of -22 ‰, not typical for diamonds of ultramafic paragenesis, which are usually in the narrow range in δ13C (-2 to -8 ‰), characteristic of the mantle (Cartigny, Elements, 2005). Diamonds with such light-isotopic carbon, as low as -44 ‰ typical for eclogitic diamonds, are considered as indicative of subduction of oceanic crust (Sobolev & Sobolev, Russ. G & G, 1980). The majority of diamonds are Type IIa; others are Type IaB. Nitrogen impurity is of the B form indicating a high-aggregation state, considered evidence for long mantle residence times at high temperatures.\nIn some Ds, nano-size inclusions were discovered using TEM techniques and composed of Mg-Al silicate-rich phases, a Ca-carbonate phase, graphite, and fluid. These micro-inclusions represent mantle fluid that had been captured in the diamond growth process, as described by Logvinova (Eur. J Min, 2008). The non-mantle δ13C values to the myriad of diamonds, combined with their nitrogen-aggregation states, are considered as supporting evidence for the formation of the diamonds from metasomatic fluids with crustal signatures.",

            "abstract": "Wetland inundation and saturation dynamics are the most important abiotic factor controlling the extent and functioning of wetlands. Remote sensing provides a major data source for monitoring wetland dynamics. In this study, we developed a new approach to map wetland inundation in the Delmarva Peninsula from 1985 to 2011. Highly accurate subpixel inundation percentage (SIP) maps were first derived at the 30 m resolution from LiDAR intensity data. These SIP maps were used as reference to establish statistical relationships between SIP and Landsat data. Regional wetland inundation was then mapped by applying the constructed model to Landsat scenes acquired in different years. Results showed that accurate maps of wetland inundation can be created using this approach, and that Landsat data can be calibrated to reveal the inundation state of wetlands and the long-term trend of wetland dynamics at the regional scale. Substantial changes in wetland inundation among dry, average, and wet years were observed, and the changes were found correlated with local drought conditions, particularly in highly inundated areas. Given the fact that Landsat data are globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly affordable and available, the approach developed in this study has the potential for deriving historical inundation changes over the past decades and for monitoring ongoing changes over much larger areas.",

            "abstract": "It can be shown that the field-field correlation function of an imperfectly diffuse wave field is equal to the (time derivative of) Green’s function times the specific intensity of the noise (Weaver, 2013). The theoretical understanding permits the interpretation of correlation amplitudes and promises to facilitate the retrieval of attenuation, site amplification factors, and scattering strengths from the noise correlation. In order to develop methods for extracting attenuation from ambient noise and apply to real data (particularly in Tibetan Plateau), we propose approaches with detailed formulations for a linear array and a more general 2D station network. A particular problem in retrieving amplitudes from noise is that seismic ambient noise source is not uniform and changes with time. We tested numerical simulations with azimuthally and temporally varying noise source, and have started to add internal scattering in the simulations. Our simulations validate that amplitudes and attenuations can indeed be extracted from noise correlations for a linear array or for a more general 2D array. We propose a temporal flattening procedure, which is effective in speeding up convergence while preserving relative amplitudes. For real data, we propose an “asynchronous” temporal flattening procedure that does not require all stations to have the data at the same time. Tests on real data suggest attenuations extracted are comparable with those from earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Impact cratering is a fundamental geological process throughout the Solar System. The Moon is an ideal location to document the impact cratering process due to the number and excellent state of preservation of large craters and basins, and the wide range of geological, geophysical, topographic, mineralogic, remote sensing and returned sample data. Despite the number and excellent preservation state of many large complex craters and basins, their formation and the origin of their structural features and the stages in their evolution remain contentious. To more comprehensively document the final stage of lunar impact basin formation, we have compiled detailed topographic, geological and mineralogic maps of several type examples of peak-ring and multi-ring basins, including the Orientale basin. These data include the mineralogic characteristics of basin ring structures and assist in the interpretation of the target stratigraphy, and the depth of origin of basin rings. Data for the current structure of basins is compared to numerical model outputs of basin-forming impacts, which track formation to the conclusion of dynamic processes (2 to 3 hours after impact). We use the Orientale basin as an example and provide combined correlations and interpretations that assign rings to various stages in the numerical models, and compare these candidates to crustal stratigraphy, with the ultimate aim of producing a consistent model for large crater/basin formation. The shock physics code iSALE is used to numerically model the basin-scale impacts. Constitutive equations and equations of state for materials analogous to the lunar crust (gabbroic anorthosite) and mantle (dunite) are used. Aspects of the numerically-produced lunar basins (e.g., material distribution and accumulated stress) are compared and contrasted to remote observations and geological maps of the Orientale rings and geological units, including ejecta and impact melt deposits.",

            "abstract": "Cholera is a global disease, with significantly large outbreaks occurring since the 1990s, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and recently in Haiti, in the Caribbean. Critical knowledge gaps remain in the understanding of the annual recurrence in endemic areas and the nature of epidemic outbreaks, especially those that follow extreme hydroclimatic events. Teleconnections with large-scale climate phenomena affecting regional scale hydroclimatic drivers of cholera dynamics remain largely unexplained. For centuries, the Bengal delta region has been strongly influenced by the asymmetric availability of water in the rivers Ganges and the Brahmaputra. As these two major rivers are known to have strong contrasting affects on local cholera dynamics in the region, we argue that the role of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), or other phenomena needs to be interpreted in the context of the seasonal role of individual rivers and subsequent impact on local environmental processes, not as a teleconnection having a remote and unified effect.\nWe present a modified hypothesis that the influences of large-scale climate phenomena such as ENSO and IOD on Bengal cholera can be explicitly identified and incorporated through regional scale hydroclimatic drivers. Here, we provide an analytical review of the literature addressing cholera and climate linkages and present hypotheses, based on recent evidence, and quantification on the role of regional scale hydroclimatic drivers of cholera. We argue that the seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and resulting river discharge in the GBM basin region during ENSO and IOD events have a dominant combined effect on the endemic persistence and the epidemic vulnerability to cholera outbreaks in spring and fall seasons, respectively, that is stronger than the effect of localized hydrological and socio-economic sensitivities in Bangladesh. In addition, systematic identification of underlying seasonal hydroclimatic drivers will allow us to harness the inherent system memory of these processes to develop early warning systems and strengthen prevention measures.",

            "abstract": "The geologic reservoirs that could be used for long-term sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) may have natural or manmade pathways that allow injected CO2, or the brine it displaces, to leak into overlying formations. Using a basin-scale leakage estimation model, we investigated the geophysical parameters that govern this leakage, and the resulting accumulations of leaked fluids in overlying formations. The results are discussed in the context of two polices aimed at governing long-term sequestration and protecting groundwater: the U.S. DOE guideline for storage permanence and the U.S. EPA UIC Program Class VI Rule. For a case study of CO2 injection into the Mt. Simon sandstone in the Michigan sedimentary basin, we showed that (1) the U.S. DOE guideline would allow for more leakage from larger injection projects than for smaller ones; (2) leakage amounts are determined mostly by well leakage permeability rather than by variation in formation permeabilities; (3) numerous leaking wells with anomalously high leakage permeabilities are necessary in order to achieve substantial leakage rates; (4) leakage can reach potable groundwater but intervening stratigraphic traps reduce the amount to be multiple orders of magnitude less than the leakage out of the reservoir, and (5) this leakage can reduce the Area of Review that is defined by the U.S. EPA as the area within which leakage can threaten groundwater. In summary, leakage that exceeds the U.S. DOE storage permanence goal would occur only under extreme conditions, the amount that reaches shallow potable groundwater may be inconsequential from a pollution standpoint, and leakage may be beneficial. Future federal policies should be harmonized to achieve the dual goals of protecting groundwater while allowing for adaptive management that incorporates uncertainties and imperfections inherent in geologic reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Regularization is an approach to ill-posed or ill-conditioned inverse problems, and using it can be viewed as adding prior information about the parameters of interest. There are many approaches to choosing a regularization parameter, but it is still an open question as to how to weight the additional information. The discrepancy principle considers the residual norm to determine the regularization parameter or weight while a similar approach, the chi-squared method, uses the regularized residual in a statistical test to find the weight. Using the regularized residual has the benefit of giving a clear chi-squared test with a fixed noise level. Recently, this approach has been developed for nonlinear problems. We will give the appropriate chi-squared tests in the Gauss-Newton and Levenburg Marquart algorithms, and these tests are used to find a regularization parameter or weight on initial parameter estimate errors. This algorithm is applied to two benchmark problems in nonlinear geophysics: two-dimensional cross-well tomography, and one dimensional subsurface conductivity estimation.",

            "abstract": "There is a recognition from academics and stakeholders that climate science has a fundamental role to play in the decision making process, but too frequently there is still uncertainty about what, when, how and why to use it. Stakeholders suggest that it is because the science is presented in an inaccessible manner, while academics suggest it is because the stakeholders do not have the scientific knowledge to understand and apply the science appropriately. What is apparent is that stakeholders need support, and that there is an onus on academia to provide it.\nThis support is even more important with recent developments in climate science, such as extreme weather event attribution. We are already seeing the impacts of extreme weather events around the world causing lost of life and damage to property and infrastructure with current research suggesting that these events could become more frequent and more intense. If this is to be the case then a better understanding of the science will be vital in developing robust adaptation and business planning.\nThe use of games, role playing and simulations to aid learning has long been understood in education but less so as a tool to support stakeholder understanding of climate science. Providing a ‘safe’ space where participants can actively engage with concepts, ideas and often emotions, can lead to deep understanding that is not possible through more passive mechanisms such as papers and web sites.\n\nThis paper reports on a game that was developed through a collaboration led by the Red Cross/Red Crescent, University of Oxford and University of Reading to help stakeholders understand the role of weather event attribution in the decision making process. The game has already been played successfully at a number of high profile events including COP 19 and the African Climate Conference. It has also been used with students as part of a postgraduate environmental management course. As well as describing the design principles of the game, the paper also evaluates the success of the game as well as future developments.",

This situation favors the formation of large masses of clouds and the presence of macroclimatic phenomena such as ENSO, which has historically caused large-scale impacts in both warm and cold phase.\nSince last decade different entities have implemented a hydro-meteorological network which measures and transmits telemetrically every five minutes hydro-climatic variables. In general, the real-time weather monitoring should be used for a better understanding of our environmental urban environment and to establish indicators of quality of life and welfare for the community.\nDespite the city has telemetric data on atmospheric and hydrological variables, there is still no tool or a methodology able to generate a spatio-temporal description of these variables. So, the aim of this work is to establish guidelines to sort all this information of atmospheric variables monitored in real time with the help of data mining techniques, machine learning tools to improve the knowledge of atmospheric patterns at Manizales and to serve for territorial planning and decision makers.\nTo reach this purpose the current data warehouse available at the National University of Colombia at Manizales will be used, and it will be fed with observed variables from hydro-meteorological monitoring stations that transmit in real-time. Then, as mentioned this information will make the corresponding processing with data mining techniques to describe the rainfall patterns. All this complemented with the application of statistical techniques for data analysis and exploration.\nThe main contribution of this research is the creation of tools to be used in numerical modeling with forecasting purposes, aiming to improve the resolution given by mesoscale models, which are currently used for weather forecast in Colombia.",

            "abstract": "We studied and discussed the depositional mechanisms of a PDC deposit recognized in the Oligocene turbite system of the Val d'Aveto Formation (Northern Italian Apennines). The deposit is characterized by a sandy-sized base (4 m-thick), overlain by a massive conglomerate (46 m-thick), whose gravel-sized detritus is overall represented by substrate-derived clasts (~80%), rather than volcaniclastic ones. Optical, diffractometric (XRD) and minero-chemical (SEM-EDS) analyses on matrix samples reveal a welded volcanic felty texture, rich in plagioclase and horneblende, with accidental metamorphic rock fragments and loose crystals that tend to upward increase along the deposit. Lithological association and roundness of gravel-sized detritus, together with the accidental lithics and loose crystals in the matrix fraction, suggest that this PDC ran channelized in a continental (mountain?) drainage before entering the basin. Channelization in this type of setting 1) enhanced the PDC erosion capacity during the motion and 2) partially cooled it. Flow reached the water at temperatures which triggered the formation of a trapped gas carapace, able to inhibit the water-flow mixing (Sparks et al. (1980-Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research). This preserved the current from a shocking water mix and favored its welding. Thus, we suggest that this model can be generally applied when PDC temperatures trigger a stable heat transfer between the flow and the water, which allows the generation of trapped gas carapace and preservation from phreatomagmatic explosions. In contrast, depositional mechanisms inferred by Whitman (1989-Marine Geology) and the ones proposed through the direct observation and sampling of a hot PDC at Montserrat Volcano (Trofimovs et al., 2006-Geology) are developed when fundamental role is played by phreatomagmatic explosions and violent water-flow mix.",

Moreover, they are no longer afraid of using new ICT tools and programs which help them to cooperate with students effectively. Since 2011 RTTC in Skierniewice has been an organizer of many on-line in-service programs for teachers, in learning Science. Some of them are organized as blended-learning programs which allow teachers to participate first in hands on activities then continue learning on the Moodle platform. These courses include two 15 and 30-hours of Astronomical topics. Teachers have the opportunity to gain knowledge and receive materials not only about the Universe and the Solar System but also can learn to use tools like Stellarium, Celestia, WorldWide Telescope, Your Sky and other tools. E-learning modules consist of both publishing learning materials in various forms, eg. PowerPoint Presentations, Word & PDF materials, web sites, publications, working sheets as well as practical duties like participation in chats, forums, tasks, Wiki, group workshop.\nTeachers use these materials for extending their knowledge as well as for preparing their own tasks, like lesson’s scenarios and school projects.

            "abstract": "The moon Io is home to a tenuous atmosphere of molecular SO2 created from the global and continuous volcanic activity. A pervasive and long lasting question regarding this spatially inhomogeneous atmosphere is whether it is supported primarily by volcanic emission, or by the sublimation of the large reservoir of SO2 frost found on the surface, and what the relative contributions are between these mechanisms. The source and variability of this SO2 is important because it significantly contributes to the Io torus and surrounding environment.\nHere, we discuss observations of Io’s atmosphere entering and exiting Jupiter eclipse, which helps separate the sublimation component of the atmosphere in vapor pressure equilibrium with the surface from the volcanic component. We present HST-COS UV (220nm) eclipse egress spectra taken in December 2011, and Gemini-TEXES mid-IR (19µm) eclipse ingress spectra from November 2013 at the beginning of JAXA’s Sprint-A/EXCEED mission. The UV spectra do not display significant variation coming out of eclipse, as would be expected if the atmosphere is in vapor pressure equilibrium. The mid-IR spectra, which are the first ever observation of Io’s bulk atmosphere going into and in eclipse, however do show significant change in the SO2 absorption bands of SO2. We will discuss the implications of these apparently contradictory results for the mechanisms supporting Io’s atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric ammonia plays an important role in aerosol particle formation and growth, as well as in nitrogen deposition to sensitive ecosystems. However, significant uncertainties are associated with the distribution and strength of emission sources, and many of the processes that control its atmospheric fate are not fully understood. The high density of agricultural and urban sources located in close proximity to more pristine mountainous areas to the west make the Colorado Front Range a unique area for studying atmospheric ammonia. The meteorology of the region, where heavy monsoon rains can be followed by rapid evaporation, can also impact surface-atmosphere partitioning of ammonia. As part of the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ), vertical profiles of ammonia were measured throughout the boundary layer aboard a moveable platform on the 300 m Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) tower.\nChanges in ammonia concentration and its vertical structure were driven not only by changes in wind direction and estimated source region, but also by fluctuations in surface and atmosphere water content. For example, large increases in atmospheric ammonia mixing ratios were observed following rain events. This may be explained by surface-atmosphere exchange of wet-deposited ammonia associated with rapid evaporation following the event, and likely impacts particle formation. This may also play a role in transport from ammonia-rich agricultural areas towards the mountainous regions to the west during periods of upslope flow. The vertical ammonia concentration gradients observed throughout the structured early morning boundary layer also provide insight into the possible causes of early morning spikes in ammonia – a phenomenon that has been well-documented in many other locations. A box model was used to assess the relative importance of surface emissions due to the evaporation of morning dew versus entrainment of ammonia-rich air from above the nocturnal boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "The visualization of and scientific “sense-making” from large datasets varying in both space and time is a challenge; one that is still being addressed in a number of different fields. The approaches taken thus far are often specific to a given academic field due to the unique questions that arise in different disciplines, however, basic approaches such as geographic maps and time series plots are still widely useful. The proliferation of model estimates of increasing size and resolution further complicates what ought to be a simple workflow: Model some geophysical phenomen(on), obtain results and measure uncertainty, organize and display the data, make comparisons across trials, and share findings.\nA new tool is in development that is intended to help scientists with the latter parts of that workflow. The tentatively-titled “Carbon Data Explorer” (http://spatial.mtri.org/flux-client/) enables users to access carbon science and related spatio-temporal science datasets over the web. All that is required to access multiple interactive visualizations of carbon science datasets is a compatible web browser and an internet connection. While the application targets atmospheric and climate science datasets, particularly spatio-temporal model estimates of carbon products, the software architecture takes an agnostic approach to the data to be visualized. Any atmospheric, biophysical, or geophysical quanity that varies in space and time, including one or more measures of uncertainty, can be visualized within the application.\nWithin the web application, users have seamless control over a flexible and consistent symbology for map-based visualizations and plots. Where time series data are represented by one or more data “frames” (e.g. a map), users can animate the data. In the “coordinated view,” users can make direct comparisons between different frames and different models or model runs, facilitating intermodal comparisons and assessments of spatio-temporal variability. Map views can display data anomalies (values relative to the measure of central tendency), aggregate data, or difference data. New features are forthcoming as the application is currently in constant development but an early version is available for the public to try out on the web (http://spatial.mtri.org/flux-client/).",

            "abstract": "The method of superparameterization is a well-established approach for (explicitly) representing moist convective-scale processes in coarse-resolution models. While the advantages of this approach include a reduction in the number of uncertain closure assumptions, a corresponding drawback is its much greater computational expense, as compared to traditional parameterization schemes. However, this drawback is becoming less of an issue with recent computing advances, so much so, that superparameterized models can now be regarded as relatively inexpensive tools for developing global cloud resolving models of the future. Indeed, there is growing evidence that even the latter models suffer from the same sorts of climatological biases as much coarser resolution models of the past. The implication is that deficiencies in the treatment of unresolved (microscale) processes are still playing an important role. With these issues in mind, a superparameterized version of the Weather Research and Forecast model has been developed for studying the sensitivities of weather and climate simulations to formulations and parameter settings in microscale physics schemes. Here the primary phenomena of interest include the MJO and climatological pattern of rainfall during boreal summer. Preliminary results show surprisingly strong sensitivities to the choice of turbulent Prandtl number, as well as to the choice of the rain collection efficiency factor.",

            "abstract": "Weak intermolecular interactions play an important role in nature and are involved in the stabilization of a variety of different molecular aggregates. Carbon dioxide clusters (CO2)n are a good example in which monomers interact through London dispersion forces. The ability to accurately describe these types of interactions is crucial in understanding fundamental molecular-scale processes controlling the chemistry of carbon dioxide, ranging from CO2 self-organization into monolayer films on metal and mineral surfaces, formation of CO2 clouds and molecular interactions in supercritical CO2. Weak interactions in (CO2)n clusters pose a challenge for experimental techniques, and are therefore in many cases either difficult or impossible to explore. Density functional theory with dispersion correction (DFT-D), on the other hand, can provide insight into intermolecular interactions among CO2 molecules, provided that dispersion correction is properly accounted for. In this presentation results from dispersion sensitive DFT (M05-2X, B97-D, B2PLYPD) and MP2 theory will be shown, that describe interactions in (CO2)n clusters over a broad range of temperatures, and in particular, in those clusters with magic number sizes 6 and 13. Briefly, structure determinations and thermodynamic calculations for (CO2)n clustering reactions by DFT-D compare well against benchmark MP2 and CCSD(T)/CBS results, and therefore may be extended to significantly larger systems than accessible with highly correlated methods. The stepwise free energies of CO2 cluster formation at temperatures from 60-400K reveal valuable new insights, the most important being that the stacked cyclic hexamer and tridecameric cluster, consisting of a 3-6-3 ring structure with a centrally enclosed CO2 monomer, are highly stable clusters and therefore should be spectroscopically detectable. These results indicate that DFT-D provides an accurate and cost effective description of non-covalent interactions in (CO2) clusters, and thus may provide important information on nucleation phenomena in CO2 phases with gas-like densities.",

            "abstract": "The AVOID programme and its successor, AVOID2, have focused on answering three core questions: how do we characterise potentially dangerous climate change and impacts, which emissions pathways can avoid at least some of these impacts, and how feasible are the future reductions needed to significantly deviate from a business-as-usual future emissions pathway. The first AVOID project succeeded in providing the UK Government with evidence to inform its position on climate change. A key part of the work involved developing a range of global emissions pathways and estimating and understanding the corresponding global impacts. This made use of a combination of complex general circulation models, simple climate models, pattern-scaling and state-of-the art impacts models. The results characterise the range of avoidable impacts across the globe in several key sectors including river and coastal flooding, cooling and heating energy demand, crop productivity and aspects of biodiversity. The avoided impacts between a scenario compatible with a 4ºC global warming and one with a 2ºC global warming were found to be highly sector dependent and avoided fractions typically ranged between 20% and 70%. A further key aspect was characterising the magnitude of the uncertainty involved, which is found to be very large in some impact sectors although the avoided fraction appears a more robust metric. \nThe AVOID2 programme began in 2014 and will provide results in the run up to the Paris CoP in 2015. This includes new post-IPCC 5th assessment evidence to inform the long-term climate goal, a more comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty ranges of feasible emission pathways compatible with the long-term goal and enhanced estimates of global impacts using the latest generation of impact models and scenarios.",

These groups have managed thousands of datasets for hundreds of Principal Investigators.\nThe datasets, including the metadata and documentation held in the archives vary in size from less than 30 kilobytes to tens of gigabytes and represent dozens of research disciplines. The ACADIS holdings alone include more than 50 scientific disciplines as defined by the NASA/GCMD keywords. The data formats vary from simple ASCII text to proprietary complex binary and imagery.\nA lot has changed in the way data are collected due to improved data collection technologies, real time processing and wide bandwidth communications. There have been some changes to data management best practices especially related to metadata, flexible formatting, DOIs, and interoperability with other archives to take advantage of new technologies, software and related support capabilities. ACADIS has spent more than 7 years working these issues and implementing an agile service approach.\nThere are some very interesting challenges that we have been confronted with and overcome during the past 20 years. However, with all those improvements there are guiding principles for the data managers that are robust and remain important even after 20 years of experience. These include the provision of evolving standards and complete metadata records to describe each dataset, International data exchange and easy access to the archived data, and the inclusion of comprehensive documentation to foster long-term reuse potential of the data. The authors will provide details on the handling of these specific issues and also consider some other more subtle situations that continue to require serious consideration and problem solving.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen isotopic compositions are among the most important constraints on the origin of Earth’s water. Earth’s bulk water content, which is small but not negligible, is significantly greater than what the thermal gradient of the solar nebula disk would suggest for planetesimal materials condensed at one astronomical unit. The proto-solar nebula is a likely source of early Earth’s water, with probable contributions from one or more of the following: water-rich planetesimals, ordinary and carbonaceous meteorites, comets, asteroids, and interplanetary dust particles. However, all of these sources have been questioned, and the proposed proto-solar nebular origin has been disputed in light of the large difference in hydrogen isotopic composition between it and terrestrial water. Current opposition to the solar nebular hypothesis is based on the critical assumption that no processes in the interior of the early Earth changed the isotopic composition of hydrogen. Nevertheless, a hypothesized hydrogenation reaction of liquid iron (2Fe + xH2 ↔ 2FeHx) during core formation likely provided a fractionation mechanism between hydrogen and deuterium (D). We propose that modern D/H ratios at Earth’s surface resulted from this isotopic fractionation and that terrestrial water originated from oxidation of proto-solar hydrogen dissolved in the magma ocean in the early Earth by coexisting oxides (such as FeO). Thus, the isotopic composition of water on Earth can be mainly explained by internal terrestrial processes.",

In this work the influences caused by changes in patterns of land cover and land use in Brazil on the behavior of the water balance over South America were evaluated. To fulfill this objective numerical experiments were carried out with the regional model ETA for the period between 1979 and 2008, in which three different conditions of land use and land cover in Brazil was used: 1) Potential Experiment, which are not included the anthropogenic changes in vegetation cover; 2) Control Experiment, in which the map of land use and land cover used the conditions of the 90s; 3) New Experiment, which represents the current conditions of land use and land cover. The results show clearly that the constant changes in patterns of land cover and land use in Brazil cause an increase in precipitation and moisture convergence, and reduced evapotranspiration over the Amazon Region. In other words, it can be stated that with the advance of changes in patterns of land use and land cover, Amazon further intensified their behavior as a sink of moisture, mainly due to increased precipitation and significant reduction in evapotranspiration, noting also that reduction of moisture available in the atmosphere was not offset by increased moisture convergence. The results on the La Plata Basin shows that initially (CONTROL) there is an increase in precipitation and evapotranspiration over the region and reduction in moisture convergence, which is later (NEW) modified to a pattern of reduction in precipitation and evapotranspiration followed by an increase in moisture convergence. These changes in the patterns of land use and land cover of the 90s make the area potentially source of moisture to the atmosphere, even with the reduction in moisture convergence, but reversing their behavior to sink moisture by inserting current vegetation cover modifications, mainly due to reduced precipitation and evapotranspiration over the basin. Thus, we can conclude that the constant changes in the land use and land cover in Brazil have direct influence on the continent water balance, influencing directly the availability of moisture to the atmosphere and moisture transport between the tropics and extratropics.",

            "abstract": "Water stress and overallocation are at the forefront of water management and policy challenges in Australia, especially in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB). Farmland within the MDB generates 40 percent of Australia’s total agricultural production and utilizes 60 percent of all irrigation water withdrawn nationally. The Murray Darling Basin Plan, drafted in 2008 and enacted in November 2012, has at its core the establishment of environmentally sustainable diversion limits based on a threshold of water extraction which, if exceeded, would cause harm to key environmental assets in the MDB. The overall goal of the Plan is to balance economic, social and environmental outcomes within the Basin.\nBecause irrigated agriculture is the major water user in the MDB, it is important to understand the factors that influence irrigation water use. We applied a mental modeling approach to assessing farmer water use decisions. The approach allowed us to solicit and document farmer insights into the multifaceted nature of irrigation water use decisions in the MDB. Following are a few insights gained from the workshops: 1) For both environmental and economic reasons, irrigators in the MDB have become experts in water use and water efficiency. Water managers and government officials could benefit by partnering with farmers and incorporating this expertise into water management decisions. 2) Irrigators in the MDB may have been misperceived when it comes to accepting policy change. Many, if not most, of the farmers we talked to understood the need for, or at least the inevitability of, governmental policies and regulations. But a lack of accountability and predictability has added to the uncertainty in farming decisions. 3) Irrigators in the MDB subscribe to the concept of environmental sustainability, although they might not always agree with how the concept is implemented. Farmers should be recognized for their significant investments in the long-term sustainability of their farms and their communities and appreciated for their role in the sustainability of the Basin. The mental modelling approach used in this research could be used to educate all stakeholders in differences in perspectives and common goals and bridge the gap into how to implement sustainable management practices.",

            "abstract": "The Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography And Spectroscopy (VERITAS) Mission, a proposed NASA Discovery mission, seeks to produce high-resolution altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, thermal emissivity, and an improved gravity field. VERITAS addresses the highest priority Decadal survey questions: 1) Did Venus host ancient aqueous environments? 2) Can understanding the roles of physics, chemistry, geology, and dynamics in driving planetary atmospheres lead to a better understanding of climate change on Earth? 3) How have chemical and physical processes operated, interacted, and evolved? Using an interferometric mapping radar, a near infrared spectrometer, and radio science experiment, VERITAS will examine 1) the similarity of tessera plateau formation to continents on Earth, 2) the current forces driving tectonics and volcanism, and, perhaps most importantly, 3) inform our understanding of how stagnant lid planets evolve. Data from VIRTIS on Venus Express show that the highly deformed tessera plateaus, possible remnants of a prior regime on Venus, may be more felsic in composition than the surrounding plains, supporting the hypothesis they are similar to Earth’s continents. However this interpretation is equivocal due to uncertainty in the available altimetry. VERITAS is designed to collect data with sufficient resolution to answer this question definitively, and also aid in the assessment of tesserae as a touchdown point for a future lander. Similarly, the enormous rift zones and mountain belts are manifestations of global scale tectonics within the last billion years on Venus, but present data are not adequate to determine the driving forces or whether they are presently active. VERITAS will provide such data through fine-resolution topographic maps and, if possible, measurements of any current-day crustal deformation. Finally, current data are highly suggestive of recent and active volcanism. VERITAS observations can tell us if current volcanism is limited to mantle plume heads or is more widespread. The geologic setting of present day volcanism or tectonism also holds lessons for predicting activity on Earth-sized planets elsewhere in the galaxy. Together these investigations allow us to assess just how similar or dissimilar the evolution of Venus and Earth has been.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate records from the mid-continental United States that span the Holocene with sub-decadal resolution are rare. This is especially true for geochemical records that capture the isotopic composition of precipitation or local precipitation/evaporation balances. As a result, many questions remain about the hydrologic expression of abrupt climate events in this region that today is one of the world’s largest agricultural centers. Here, we present sedimentological, geochemical, and chronological data spanning the last 3,000 years from a set of sediment cores from Martin Lake in northeastern Indiana. Today, this kettle lake is hydrologically open with persistent water column stratification and bottom water anoxia. Radiometric dating shows that the lake formed at approximately 16,000 cal yr BP and continuously accumulated sediment thereafter. We focus here on developing a stable isotope record of the late Holocene at decadal resolution to provide a detailed view of precipitation isotopic variability during this time. The Midwest has been influenced by changes in atmospheric circulation patterns throughout the late Holocene, leading to climate events like the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly, which significantly changed temperature and precipitation regimes. The isotopic composition of precipitation in the Midwest has been shown to be heavily influenced by the source of atmospheric moisture as mediated by the Pacific North American mode of atmospheric variability that in turn affects the position of the Polar Front Jetstream. Using high-resolution stable isotope measurements and ultimately climate modeling, we seek to reconstruct the isotopic expression of late Holocene climate events in the mid continental United States and assess the possible relationship with these dominant modes of atmospheric variability. Future work includes extending this reconstruction through the Holocene and increasing the temporal resolution of the data.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a localized surface albedo modification technique that shows promise as a method to increase reflective multi-year ice using floating materials, chosen so as to have low subsidiary environmental impact. It is now well-known that multi-year reflective ice has diminished rapidly in the Arctic over the past 3 decades and this plays a part in the continuing rapid decrease of summer-time ice. As summer-time bright ice disappears, the Arctic is losing its ability to reflect summer insolation, and this has widespread climatic effects, as well as a direct effect on sea level rise, as oceans heat and once-land-based ice melts into the sea.\nWe have tested the albedo modification technique on a small scale over six Winter/Spring seasons at sites including California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains, a Canadian lake, and a small man-made lake in Minnesota, using various materials and an evolving array of instrumentation. The materials can float and can be made to minimize effects on marine habitat and species. The instrumentation is designed to be deployed in harsh and remote locations.\nLocalized snow and ice preservation, and reductions in water heating, have been quantified in small-scale testing. We have continued to refine our material and deployment approaches, and we have had laboratory confirmation by NASA.\nIn the field, the materials were successfully deployed to shield underlying snow and ice from melting; applications of granular materials remained stable in the face of local wind and storms. We are evaluating the effects of snow and ice preservation for protection of infrastructure and habitat stabilization, and we are concurrently developing our techniques to aid in water conservation.\nLocalized albedo modification options such as those being studied in this work may act to preserve ice, glaciers, permafrost and seasonal snow areas, and perhaps aid natural ice formation processes. If this method is deployed on a large enough scale, it could conceivably bring about a reduction in the Ice-Albedo Feedback Effect, possibly slowing one of the key effects and factors in climate change.",

            "abstract": "The perspective of climate change increases the necessity of tackling the urban over heating effects, by developing strategies to mitigate/adapt to changes. Analysing the influence of urban form on intra-urban temperature dynamics could be a helpful way of reducing its negative consequences. Also, it would help untangle the urban effect from the effect caused by atmospheric conditions. The present paper presents the effect of atmospheric conditions as exemplified by atmospheric stability (modified Pasquill-Gifford-Turner classification system) and urban morphology as measured by the Sky View Factor (SVF) on intra-urban variations in air temperature in a cold climate city, in and around the mature urban area of Glasgow, UK (55° 51' 57.294\"N, 4° 15' 0.2628\"W). The aim is to highlight their combined importance and to make preliminary investigations on the local warming effect of urban morphology under specific atmospheric stability classes. The present work indicates that the maximum intra-urban temperature differences (i.e. temperature difference between the coolest and the warmest spots in a given urban region) is strongly correlated with atmospheric stability. The spatial patterns in local temperature variations consistently show that water bodies and urban parks have lower temperature variations. Thus, greenery and urban materials could play an important role in influencing the local climate in cold cities. The knowledge of urban morphology’s influence on local temperature variations could be an important tool for devising appropriate planning/design strategies to face urban overheating in the coming years as the background climate continues to warm.",

            "abstract": "On Earth, meandering streams occur where the banks are resistant to erosion, which enhances narrow and deep channels. Often this is because the stream banks are held firm by vegetation. The ancient, highly sinuous channels with cutoffs found on Mars are enigmatic because vegetation played no role in providing bank cohesion and enhancing fine sediment deposition. Possible causes of the meandering therefore include ice under permafrost conditions and chemical processes. We conducted carbonate flume experiments to investigate possible mechanisms creating meandering channels other than vegetation. The experiment includes a tank that dissolves limestone by adding CO2 gas and produces artificial spring water, peristaltic pumps to drive water through the system, a heater to control the temperature of the spring water, and a flume where carbonate sediment deposits. Spring water containing dissolved calcium and carbonate ions moves through a heater to increase temperature, and then into the flume. The flume surface is open to the air to allow CO2 degassing, decrease temperature, and increase pH, which promotes carbonate precipitation. A preliminary experiment was done and successfully created a meander pattern that evolved over a 3-day experiment. The experiment showed lateral migration of the bend and avulsion of the stream, similar to a natural meander. The lateral variation in flow speed increased the local residence time of water, thus increasing the degassing of CO2 on the two sides of the flow and promoting more precipitation. This enhanced precipitation on the sides provided a mechanism to build levees along the channel and created a stream confined in a narrow path. This mechanism also potentially applies to Earthly single thread and/or meandering rivers developed and recorded before vegetation appeared on Earth’s surface.",

            "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2 and CH4 concentrations and fluxes is a key element of current climate change research. Methane (CH4) is the third most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere after water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), and the second anthropogenic GHG after CO2.\nMERLIN (The Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission) is a new Franco-German (CNES and DLR) space borne Lidar mission initiated late 2009, now in Phase B, for global monitoring of atmospheric methane (CH4) the second anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The two national agencies CNES and DLR, the French Space Agency and German Space Administration, respectively, set up jointly to bodies: a Group Project and a Science Advisory Group, to drive the mission development until achievement.\nThe MERLIN mission is based on a small satellite. The launch is foreseen in 2019 for 3 years operation. The space segment consists of the new platform product line named MYRIADE Evolutions (total mass) developed under CNES control, and an advanced IPDA (Integrated Path Differential Absorption) Lidar instrument under DLR responsibility to be developed by ASTRIUM Germany.\nThe 1st science objective is to provide a significant improvement on retrieval of CH4 fluxes at synoptic scales, which in turn calls for 1% accuracy on CH4 column averaged air dry-mixing ratio (XCH4) at a 50 km horizontal resolution. A second objective is to contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry at global scale.\nA first prototype has been developed to process the raw lidar signal that will be delivered by the MERLIN lidar instrument. This last will allow the extraction of the XCH4 concentration and corresponding weighting function. These two parameters will allow to determine the map of the radiative transfers due to CH4 concentration. Here, we will present the breakdown of the level 2 performance (on XCH4) into major contributors.\nTo complete these objectives, and due to the lack of real datasets before the launch of the MERLIN mission, we develop a MERLIN data simulator, called LIDSIM, allowing us to make some tests on the MERLIN data processor, and characterize the expected performances of this last before the launch. The Lidar Signals Simulator module is composed of 3 sub modules: the Geometry, the Scene Generation and the Instrument.",

The team successfully produced ionospheric electron density profiles and continues to operate the CanX-2 GPS payload and collect reliable data six years into the mission. Recently the University of Calgary partnered with Spire to develop low-cost atmospheric sounding methods based on GNSS radio occultations for nanosatellite platforms. The rapidly increasing capabilities on nanosatellites with regards to power production, pointing accuracy and antenna sensitivities provide an ever more attractive platform to create relevant solutions for space and terrestrial weather data.\nThis paper describes future mission concepts and capabilities for multi-GNSS methods to generate high-resolution atmospheric profiles. Building on lessons learned from CanX-2, the system requirements are defined and recommendations made for efficient GNSS payload operations. New methods are assessed for multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS radio occultation approaches. Software and hardware simulations are conducted for validation of proposed methods using appropriate receiver architectures. Analyses include signal tracking for LEO trajectories (and Dopplers) and high-precision navigation solutions. Initial data analysis is also presented for a miniaturized, multi-frequency, software-­defined GNSS receiver currently operating onboard Spire’s innovative CubeSat platform.",

            "abstract": "We seek to understand the δ18O signal of n-alkanols, a biosynthetically similar compound group to the highly studied n-alkanes. Alkanols of >24 carbons are produced at the leaf level, incorporating a transpiration enriched oxygen and hydrogen signal. The use of δ18O as a proxy is of great interest because of the more simplistic biosynthetic sourcing of oxygen in lipids. Complete equilibration of organic and water bound oxygen atoms is achieved in the Calvin cycle (all oxygen atoms are at some point in an exchangeable carbonyl group). This leads to a uniform signal among oxygen atoms incorporated through photosynthesis. Although it is analytically useful, the larger abundance of hydrogen isotopes in the same molecule leads to a more ambiguous signal, especially when integrating through soils and sediments. This study stems from recent work in our lab, which has shown significant relationships between an applied evapotranspiration deficit and δ18O in bulk lipid (hexane) extracts of plant material. While it is exciting that bulk lipids show this relationship, it is critical to first demonstrate that the isotopic signal is stable in order to use the signal from preserved alkanols as an integrator in soils and sediments. In this experiment, we show for the first time that a series of n-alkanols do not exchange oxygen with environmental water. Moving forward we are developing methods to address the analytical challenges of measuring oxygen isotope ratios of these compounds. Once this is overcome, we will be able to measure δD, δ18O, and δ13C from a single compound in a homogenized sample. The end result will be an improvement in the ability to interpret changes in field scale evapotranspiration, moving from a 2 dimensional (δD and δ13C only) to 3 dimensional (i.e. the addition of δ18O) model. This will apply to both modern and paleohydrologic relationships, improving our ability to reconstruct and predict the impacts of water balance variability across spatiotemporal scales, especially in terrestrial environments.",

            "abstract": "Instrumental climate data, paleoclimate data, and climate models show that large volcanic eruptions cause significant global cooling by injecting reflective aerosols into the upper atmosphere, increasing planetary albedo (see Robock et al., 2000 and references therein). As such, these eruptions provide an empirical constraint on the relationship between radiative forcing and climatic response – a key uncertainty in numerical simulations of future climate change. However, the overall magnitude of a large eruption’s climatic effects, and their regional expression, remain highly uncertain, and are the subject of heated debate in the peer-reviewed literature (Robock et al., 2005; Timmreck et al., 2009; Mann et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Anchukaitis et al., 2012). As the largest eruption of the last 2 million years, the Toba eruption ~74 thousand years before present (kybp) on Sumatra presents an opportunity to probe the climatic responses associated with a massive perturbation to the Earth’s radiative balance. Here we present trace metal as well as isotopic data from U/Th-dated stalagmites from Gunung Mulu National Park, in northern Borneo, across the Toba depth horizon. Previously published timeseries of stalagmite oxygen isotopes (Carolin et al., 2013) document a significant positive anomaly contemporaneous with the Toba super-eruption (interpreted as dry conditions at the site), but the degree to which Toba contributed to this anomaly has remained uncertain. We present new synchrotron-based micro x-ray fluorescence data showing the presence of distinct horizons in the Toba time interval with elevated concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Co, possibly indicating the presence of Toba ash in the samples. Working with an array of trace elements, we compare the stalagmite geochemistry in these horizons to the geochemistry of 1) distal ash samples from the Younger Toba Tuff (Smith et al., 2011), 2) clays isolated from the Gunung Mulu caves, and 3) depth horizons marked by brown layers and/or known hiatuses. We illustrate the promise of synchrotron-based fluorescence for identifying trace volcanic ash in stalagmites, with potentially broad applications in paleoclimate.",

            "abstract": "The knowledge of stress field is fundamental not only to understand driving forces and plate deformation but also in the study of intraplate seismicity. In Brazil, the stress field has been determined mainly using focal mechanisms and a breakout data and in-situ measurements. However, the stress field still is poorly known in Brazil.\nWe show a recent compilation of focal mechanism determined in Brazil (Fig 1). The focal mechanisms of some recent earthquakes (magnitude lower than 5 mb) were studied using waveform modeling. We stacked the record of several teleseismic stations (> 30°) with a good signal/noise ratio and we grouped then according to distance and azimuth.\nWith the focal mechanisms available in literature and those obtained in this work, we were able to identify some patterns: the central region shows compressional pattern (E-W SHmax), which is predicted by regional theoretical models ( Coblentz & Richardson, 1996 and the TD0 model of Lithgow & Bertelloni, 2004). This compression is mainly due to the interaction of tectonic plate forces.\nMeanwhile in the Amazon region, we find an indication of SHMax oriented in the SE-NW direction, probably caused by the Caribbean plate interaction (Meijer, 1995) and Amazon Fan, we have flexural stresses caused by sedimentary load with is in agreement with local theoretical models (Watts et al., 2009) . In northern coastal region, the compression rotates following the coastline, which indicates an important local component related to spreading effects at the continental/oceanic transition (Assumpção, 1998).\nWe determine the focal mechanism of several events in Brazil using different techniques according to the available data. The major difficulty is to determine focal mechanism of low magnitudes events (< 5.0 mb) using distant or few seismograph stations. We find examples of stress perturbations induced by local effects (e.g. flexure and continental spreading). The results of this work should be useful for future numerical modeling of global/regional intraplate stress field.",

When models are used to support water planning, stakeholders are usually not involved in their development and use, and the models commonly fail to represent important feedbacks between socio-economic and physical processes.\nThis paper presents the development of holistic models of the Du Chêne basin in Quebec, and the Rechna Doab basin in Pakistan, that simulate socio-economic and physical processes related to, respectively, water quality management, and soil salinity management. The models each consists of two sub-components: a System Dynamics (SD) model, and a physically based model. The SD component was developed in collaboration with key stakeholders in the basins. The Du Chêne SD model was coupled with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, while the Rechna Doab SD model was coupled with SahysMod, a soil salinity model.\n The coupled models were used to assess the environmental and socio-economic impacts of different management scenarios proposed by stakeholders.\nResults indicate that coupled SD – physically-based models can be used as effective tools for participatory water planning and implementation. The participatory modeling process provides a structure for meaningful stakeholder engagement, and the models themselves can be used to transparently and coherently assess and compare different management options.",

            "abstract": "Deterministic snow accumulation and ablation simulation models are widely used by runoff managers throughout the world to predict runoff quantities and timing. Model fitting is typically based on matching modeled runoff volumes and timing with observed flow time series at a few points in the basin. In recent decades, sparse networks of point measurements of the mountain snowpacks have been available to compare with modeled snowpack, but the comparability of results from a snow sensor or course to model polygons of 5 to 50 sq. km is suspect. However, snowpack extent, depth, and derived snow water equivalent have been produced by the NASA/JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) mission for spring of 20013 and 2014 in the Tuolumne River basin above Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. These high-resolution snowpack data have exposed the weakness in a model calibration based on runoff alone. The U.S. Geological Survey's Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) calibration that was based on 30-years of inflow to Hetch Hetchy produces reasonable inflow results, but modeled spatial snowpack location and water quantity diverged significantly from the weekly measurements made by ASO during the two ablation seasons. The reason is that the PRMS model has many flow paths, storages, and water transfer equations, and a calibrated outflow time series can be right for many wrong reasons. The addition of a detailed knowledge of snow extent and water content constrains the model so that it is a better representation of the actual watershed hydrology. The mechanics of recalibrating PRMS to the ASO measurements will be described, and comparisons in observed versus modeled flow for both a small subbasin and the entire Hetch Hetchy basin will be shown. The recalibrated model provided a bitter fit to the snowmelt recession, a key factor for water managers as they balance declining inflows with demand for power generation and ecosystem releases during the final months of snow melt runoff.",

            "abstract": "Channel morphology and dynamics strongly influence fish populations in running waters by defining habitat template for movement, spawning, incubation, and foraging. In this research we adopted a modeling approach to investigate how body size controls the relationship between salmonid fish and their foraging habitat in streams. Body size is a fundamental ecological parameter which affects resource acquisition, locomotory costs, metabolic rates, and competitive abilities. We focus on two specific questions. First, we examined how distinct types of channel morphology and associated flow fields shape specific growth potential for different body size classes of trout. Second, we modeled these fish-habitat relationships in a size-structured population in the presence of intraspecific competition. In the latter scenario, fish may not be able to occupy energetically optimal foraging habitat and the predicted specific growth potential may differ from the intrinsic habitat quality. To address the research questions, we linked a 2D hydrodynamic model with a bioenergetic foraging model for drift-feeding trout. Net energy intake, simulated for four study reaches with different channel morphology, was converted into maps of specific growth rate potential. We extended this model by including a component that enabled us to estimate territory size for fish of a given body size and account for the effects of competition on spatial distribution of fish. The predictions that emerge from our simulations highlight that fish body size is an important factor that determines the relationship between channel morphology and the quality of foraging habitat. The results also indicate that distinct types of channel morphology may give rise to different energetic conditions for different body size classes of drift-feeding salmonids.",

Its location and orography are such that the summit typically lies above the well mixed marine boundary layer. A station was established in the caldera of the volcano at 2225 m by the late Dr. Richard Honrath in collaboration with the University of the Azores and began collecting data in 2001. A seven-wavelength aethalometer was employed to measure the black carbon equivalent mass concentration in the free troposphere since then. In 2012 a three wavelength nephelometer was added to measure total light scattering and back scattering due to aerosol. In 2013 an optical particle counter was added. Aerosol, including black carbon, play an important role in atmospheric processes for a number of reasons including different radiative forcing effects, acting as a cloud condensation and ice nuclei and changing surface albedo of snow.\nWe present the wavelength-dependent aerosol optical properties measured during the 2012, 2013 and 2014 sampling seasons along with particle count data when available.

Such search and analysis capabilities exploit AVA’s unprecedented time-series data compilations for over 1,550 volcanoes worldwide (Smithsonian Holocene catalog). Results include thermal anomaly detection and mapping, as well as detection of SO2 plumes from explosive eruptions and passive SO2 emissions confined to the troposphere. We are also implementing retrospective ASTER image retrievals based on volcanic activity reports from Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) and the US Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).

It’s a time when many high school science educators, who otherwise would venture outside with their classes, hunker down and are wary of the outdoors. However, a plethora of learning opportunities lies just beyond the classroom. Working collaboratively, a high school science teacher and a snow scientist have developed multiple activities to engage students in the scientific process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting the winter world using snow data to (1) learn about the insulative properties of snow, and (2) to learn about the role of snow cover on winter climate through its reflective properties while participating in a volunteer network that collects snow depth, albedo (reflectivity), and density data. These outdoor field-based snow investigations incorporate Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and disciplinary core ideas, including ESS2.C: The roles of water in Earth’s surface processes and ESS2.D: Weather and Climate. Additionally, the lesson plans presented address Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in Mathematics, including the creation and analysis of bar graphs and time series plots (CCSS.Math.HSS-ID.A.1) and xy scatter plots (CCSS.Math.HSS-ID.B.6). High school students participating in the 2013/2014 snow sampling season described their outdoor learning experience as “authentic” and “hands-on” as compared to traditional class indoors. They emphasized that learning outdoors was essential to their understanding of underlying content and concepts because they “learn through actual experience.”",

This contribution presents thermobarometric results obtained from lavas of the Caburgua-Huelemolle Small Eruptive Centers (CHSEC), composed of pyroclastic cones and associated lava flows of basaltic composition, belonging to the Southern Volcanic Zone. These results are compared with those available data in Holocene volcanic products of the Villarrica Volcano located 10 km south of the CHSEC.\nPhenocrysts consist of isolated crystals and clots of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine. Plagioclase phenocrysts are commonly unzoned (An88-92), although a very small (> 20 μm) rim of more albitic (An55-70) composition occurs. Olivines mainly have composition Fo85 with a 50-80 μm rim of Fo79. Clinopyroxene phenocrysts exhibit a narrow compositional range (Wo44-46, En45-47, Fs7-9). Chromian spinels (#Mg= 43-94, #Cr= 16-33) are commonly found as inclusions in olivine phenocrysts. Microlites include plagioclase (An59-77), clinopyroxene (Wo8-40, En45-63, Fs13-31), olivine (Fo70-76) magnetite and titanomagnetites (Mgt = 77, Usp = 23).\nPre-eruptive temperatures of the CHSEC between 1,221 and 1,227 ± 6 °C were obtained from olivine-augite phenocrysts. Olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts crystallized at pressures between 8.6 and 12.8 kbar consistent with a reservoir located at the base of the crust. The maximum syn-eruptive temperatures of 1,170 ± 6 °C were obtained in olivine-augite groundmass microcryst pairs, the loss of temperature is consistent with an adiabatic ascent from the base of the crust without an intermediate reservoir.\nThe CHSEC pre-eruptive conditions are different from those obtained from Holocene lavas and bombs of the Villarrica Volcano. Pre-eruptive temperatures between 1,041 and 1,168 °C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.6 kbar were obtained in the Villarrica Volcano. In addition, chromian spinel inclusions in olivine of Villarrica Volcano bombs (#Al= 2-19) have compositions that differ from those of the CHSEC (#Al= 29-33) , suggesting independent reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Observations of nightglow (upper atmospheric emission from atoms and molecules on the nightside of a planet) allow for a multifaceted study of planetary atmospheres. Information on winds, chemistry, and solar effects is gained by observing temporal and spatial variation in nightglow intensity. One of the brightest nightglow features on Earth is the OI (1S-1D) 557.7 nm line (oxygen green line). This emission is primarily due to photodissociation/transport but is also seen in the aurora as electron precipitation. Unlike Earth, the Venusian green line is highly temporally variable. The chemistry and mechanisms responsible are still unknown. We observe the Venusian nightglow before and after solar flares, which produce large amounts of EUV emission, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) impacts, which inject a large number of higher energy charged particles in the the Venusian atmosphere. We consistently detect green line emission after large charged particles injections from CMEs. However we do not detect the OI (1D) red line at 630.0 nm, which is quenched below 150 km. We propose that the Venusian green line is an auroral-type emission due to electron precipitation and is occurring deep in the atmosphere, near 125 km. To investigate how CMEs and solar flares affect the electron energy, flux, and density in the Venusian nightside atmosphere, we compare data taken by ASPERA and ELS onboard Venus Express (VEX) before and after solar storms. We find that both electron energy and flux increase after CMEs, but only flux increases after solar flares. Additionally, the V1 ionospheric layer at 125 km increases in electron density while the V2 at 150 km decreases in density after CMEs but not after solar flares. We model the nightside Venusian ionosphere using the observed electron energy and fluxes from VEX in an effort to constrain the chemical processes and mechanisms responsible for green line emission. We will present the results of our ground-based observations and modeling.",

            "abstract": "Observed changes in the decay rate of methyl chloroform (MCF; CH3CCl3) have been the traditional top-down constraint for variability in tropospheric abundances of the hydroxyl radical (OH), and thereby the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, as atmospheric MCF concentrations approach detection limits following its ban under the Montréal Protocol, it is necessary to identify new proxies for global OH and its variability. We present here a novel proxy for tropospheric OH using convolved observations of total and tropospheric columns of ozone, water vapor, NO2, and CO, available from the Aura and Aqua satellites in the NASA Earth Observing System constellation. Derived from photochemical steady-state assumptions, the satellite proxy generates spatiotemporally coherent monthly percent anomalies in column OH for Oct. 2004 through Sept. 2012. We demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the globally integrated signal is statistically consistent with changes inferred by the MCF decay rate during this period. The magnitude of interannual variability in the satellite OH proxy is smaller than that from MCF, more consistent with global chemical transport models (CTMs). We evaluate the proxy by comparing to 9-year hind-cast simulations of the GEOS-Chem global CTM driven by MERRA reanalysis meteorology at 2° x 2.5° horizontal resolution, and find that the satellite proxy correlates with the airmass-weighted tropospheric monthly mean OH anomalies (R = 0.6; n = 96 months). The satellite proxy and model simulations indicate regional-scale coherent OH anomalies for many regions and seasons; where discrepancies occur, we highlight possible causes. We present a source attribution of the spatial and temporal patterns in the satellite OH proxy, informed by the individual components of the satellite proxy, a series of zero-emission sensitivity simulations with GEOS-Chem, and independent proxies for major modes of climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols and precipitation are among the agents responsible for the ongoing changes in the Arctic climate and the hydrological cycle. The seasonal variations of Arctic aerosols (Arctic haze for e.g.) are linked to the transport efficiency as well as precipitation (wet) scavenging. Aside from affecting aerosol concentrations, precipitation is an important hydrological variable that affects the moisture budget of the atmosphere. Aerosols, in turn, influence the vertical distribution of clouds and this induces changes in the precipitation pattern. The spatial and temporal sparsity of precipitation measurements over the Arctic region means that satellite remote sensing techniques take on an importance that considerably exceeds their role south of the Arctic circle. Radar reflectivity and snow profiles from CloudSat (in support of cloud and precipitation analyses) and backscattering measurements from CALIOP (investigations of aerosol and small cloud particle properties) can be used to study Arctic winter clouds and precipitation and the role of aerosols in their formation.\nIn this study we attempt to validate satellite-based profiling retrievals of precipitation parameters using AHSRL (Arctic High Spectral Resolution Lidar), CRL (CANDAC Raman Lidar) and MMCR (Milli-Meter Cloud Radar) profiles acquired at the PEARL high-Arctic site in Eureka (80 °N, 86 °W), Nunavut, Canada. As part of the process of validating the profiling retrievals we aspire to learn more about the mechanisms controlling aerosol, cloud and precipitation inter-dynamics. In addition, ground-based, high-frequency observations of precipitation will be used for characterizing precipitation totals as well as the conditional probability of the type of precipitation (rain or snow) and thus to help understand and validate comparable information extracted from the satellite retrievals. We also aim to characterize different particle types using AHSRL and CRL depolarization profiles, MMCR Doppler velocity profiles and information garnered from MMCR / lidar effective radius retrievals. Finally, passive measurements of precipitation and possibly modelling simulations will add a contextual and spatial-continuity context to the spatially sparse CloudSat and CALIOP retrievals.",

There are multiple aquifers within this region used for public consumption, livestock production, and agriculture. Initial observations by the United States Geological Survey and independent residential water quality assessments have identified some wells containing arsenic concentrations an order of magnitude greater than the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level of 10 parts per billion for drinking water. However, these data are inadequate to characterize the spatial extent of arsenic contamination throughout the basin; it remains unclear which aquifers are contaminated. The basin contains a geology comprised of tuffaceous sedimentary rocks and basalt formations with extensive faulting. Productive wells range in depth from 6 to 240 meters. The present study examines the spatial extent and seasonal variation of arsenic concentrations due to changing water levels stemming from agricultural pumping. These data will aid in the development of a regional model of arsenic contamination throughout the basin.",

            "abstract": "The deformation behavior of quartz and feldspar controls the rheology of large parts of the continental crust. One way to understand the deformation of these abundant and important minerals in the deep crust is to compare their behavior within and outside of naturally-deformed shear zones. To this end, three samples of quartzofeldspathic gneiss within and adjacent to the Salt Mylonite Zone, a discrete ductile deformation zone in the ultrahigh-pressure Western Gneiss Region of Norway, are investigated in terms of microstructure, chemical composition, and fabric. The three samples represent the microstructural variation across the shear zone including grain size variation, layered (quartz ribbon bearing) v. non-layered gneiss, and variation in modal abundance. Layered gneiss is composed of one grain thick, laterally continuous quartz ribbons with plagioclase and accessory phases in the intervening regions. Non-layered gneiss consists of isolated quartz (individual grains or clusters of up to four grains) within an interconnected network of plagioclase and accessory phases. In layered gneiss, quartz preserves a well-developed crystallographic preferred orientation consistent with dominant activation of the prism and rhomb <a> slip systems, and plagioclase preserves a nearly random fabric. Quartz fabrics from layered shear zone gneiss are stronger than those of quartz from layered gneiss outside of the shear zone. In non-layered gneiss, plagioclase develops a fabric that is consistent with activation of the (001) <010> slip system whereas quartz exhibits a random fabric. Plagioclase in all samples is zoned from Na-richer cores to Ca-richer rims (reverse zoning); zoning is weaker outside of the shear zone (average core-to-rim ΔAn 6%) than within the shear zone (average core-to-rim ΔAn 10%). Results suggest a change in plagioclase and quartz deformation mechanisms occurred during decompression and shear zone development owing to strain/strain-rate variation.",

            "abstract": "Global cooling over the last 5 myrs, from the warm Pliocene to the cold ice ages, is associated with changes in circulation and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Since primary productivity is limited by bioavailable nitrogen (N), fluctuations in the oceanic fixed N inventory potentially played an important role in these cooling trends. This inventory of fixed N is a balance of fixation and denitrification; both processes impart N isotope effects. Published records of increasing N isotopic values of bulk sediment have been interpreted as indicating intensification of denitrification with global cooling. However, most data, such as from California margin ODP Site 1012 (Liu et al., 2007), are from upwelling regions of the east Pacific where changes in N utilization may have occurred, obscuring the signature of changes in the N isotopic value of source nitrate which is affected by denitrification. Our study focuses on Site 1010, located off-shore from Site 1012 in a region of compete N utilization where we can obtain a record of isotopic values of source N, and thus of the evolution of denitrification during global cooling.",

Radiocarbon (Δ14C) isotopic measurements have been perhaps the most important data constraining the cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but little Δ14C data specific to DON is available. Amino acids (AAs) are the major component of DON that can be isolated on a molecular level. Δ14C measurements for the operational “protein-like” fraction of DOM in the deep ocean indicate that this compound class has radiocarbon ages greater than several ocean mixing cycles, suggesting remarkable preservation of labile AAs exported from the surface. However, it is possible that the previously defined operational “protein-like” fraction may also contain non-AA material. Radiocarbon measurement of purified individual AAs would provide a more direct and reliable proxy for DON Δ14C age and cycling rate.\nWe present here Δ14C blank characterization of an AA purification method based on HPLC, with on-line fraction collection. This method allows the recovery of unmodified AAs, but accurate measurement of small AA samples that can be extracted from DOM requires a system with extremely low Δ 14C blanks. Here we assess the impact of HPLC purification on the Δ14C age of known amino acids standards. Individual AA standards with contrasting (modern vs. dead) and well- characterized Δ14C ages were processed in a range of sample sizes. The eluted peaks were collected and dried, and measurement of their post-chromatography Δ14C content allowed for determination of the Δ14C blank by method of additions. The same protocol was applied to a mixture of six AA standards, to evaluate tailing effects in consecutive AA peaks of contrasting Δ14C age. AA standards were selected to include both Δ14C modern and dead AAs that elute both early and late in the chromatographic solvent program. We discuss implications for future Δ14C analysis of AAs purified from DOM by this method.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the technical analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assessed the climate risks posed to the United States’ economy in a number of economic sectors [1]. The main analysis presents projections of climate impacts with an assumption of “no adaptation”. Yet, historically, when the climate imposed an economic cost upon society, adaptive responses were taken to minimise these costs. These adaptive behaviours, both autonomous and planned, can be expected to occur as climate impacts increase in the future.\nTo understand the extent to which adaptation might decrease some of the worst impacts of climate change, we empirically estimate adaptive responses. We do this in three sectors considered in the analysis - crop yield, crime, and mortality – and estimate adaptive capacity in two steps. First, looking at changes in climate impacts through time, we identify a historical rate of adaptation. Second, spatial differences in climate impacts are then used to stratify regions into more adapted or less adapted based on climate averages. As these averages change across counties in the US, we allow each to become more adapted at the rate identified in step one. We are then able to estimate the residual damages, assuming that only the historical adaptive behaviours have taken place (fig 1).\nImportantly, we are unable to estimate any costs associated with these adaptations, nor are we able to estimate more novel (for example, new technological discoveries) or more disruptive (for example, migration) adaptive behaviours.\nHowever, an important insight is that historical adaptive behaviours may not be capable of reducing the worst impacts of climate change. The persistence of impacts in even the most exposed areas indicates that there are non-trivial costs associated with adaptation that will need to be met from other sources or through novel behavioural changes.\n",

            "abstract": "The Samail Ophiolite, one of the largest and best exposed ophiolite complexes, is a Tethyan ophiolite obducted in the Late Cretaceous onto the formerly passive Arabian platform as Arabia began its most recent >1000 km northward migration towards a Miocene collision with Eurasia. The Oman Mountains, northeastern Arabian Peninsula have yet to collide with Eurasia; present uplift and form of the mountains also date to the Miocene. In addition to the scientific scrutiny of the ophiolite complex, the geologic constraints on the timing and emplacement of the ophiolite are abundant with no consensus on the obduction mechanism or its original tectonic setting. The crustal thickness of the ophiolite is comparable to thicknesses observed for “normal” mid-ocean ridges. Largely on the basis of structural and paleomagnetic arguments, some workers have attributed its origin to Pacific-type fast spreading ridges and complex micro plate geometries. Indeed the lower pillow lava sequences and much of the gabbroic crust have isotope and geochemical signatures consistent with a MORB source. However, because of the geochemistry of the upper pillow lavas, the ophiolite is most often characterized as a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolite, i.e. it sits in the hanging wall of some large tectonic structure for part of its history. In the absence of a preserved arc, the SSZ designation has little explanatory power only being a declaration of allochthony or about chemical properties of the mantle source. That associated continental shelf and oceanic crustal sections have suffered either clockwise or counterclockwise PT time trajectories requires some type of nascent subduction and hanging wall thrust transport of the young ridge crest. The widespread Late Cretaceous obduction of Tethyan oceanic crust and mantle over thousands of kilometers strike length is a problem for SSZ models (arc, forearc, back arc etc.) because arc initiation results in thick crust on short time scales, none of which is preserved. Similarly, fast spreading models require the subduction of >106 km2 without the initiation and preservation of a magmatic arc. Some Late Cretaceous major plate boundary reorganization that resulted in the current plate motion regime with NNE convergence between Afro-Arabia and Eurasia will be part of any final solution to the Oman problem.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assessed the climate risks posed to the United States’ economy in six sectors - crop yields, energy demand, coastal property, crime, labor productivity, and mortality [1]. The ACP is unique in its characterization of the full probability distribution of economic impacts of climate change throughout the 21st century, making it an extremely useful basis for risk assessments.\nThree key innovations allow for this characterization. First, climate projections from CMIP5 models are scaled to a temperature probability distribution derived from a coarser climate model (MAGICC). This allows a more accurate representation of the whole distribution of future climates (in particular the tails) than a simple ensemble average. These are downscaled both temporally and spatially. Second, a set of local sea level rise and tropical cyclone projections are used in conjunction with the most detailed dataset of coastal property in the US in order to capture the risks of rising seas and storm surge.\nThird, we base many of our sectors on empirically-derived responses to temperature and precipitation. Each of these dose-response functions is resampled many times to populate a statistical distribution. Combining these with uncertainty in emissions scenario, climate model, and weather, we create the full probability distribution of climate impacts from county up to national levels, as well as model the effects upon the economy as a whole.\nResults are presented as likelihood ranges, as well as changes to return intervals of extreme events. The ACP analysis allows us to compare between sectors to understand the magnitude of required policy responses, and also to identify risks through time. Many sectors displaying large impacts at the end of the century, like those of mortality, have smaller changes in the near-term, due to non-linearities in the response functions. Other sectors, like coastal damages, have monotonically increasing costs throughout the 21st century. Taken together, the results from the ACP presents a unique and novel view of the short-, medium-, and long-term economic risks of climate change in the US.\n",

The Natural Disaster Application Area applies its remote sensing observations, modeling and analysis capabilities to provide hazard and disaster information where and when it is needed. Our application research activities specifically contribute to 1) Understanding the natural processes that produce hazards, 2)Developing hazard mitigation technologies, and 3)Recognizing vulnerability of interdependent critical infrastructure. The Natural Disasters Application area selects research projects through a rigorous, impartial peer-review process that address a broad spectrum of disasters which afflict populations within the United States, regionally and globally. Currently there are 19 active projects in the research portfolio which address the detection, characterization, forecasting and response to a broad range of natural disasters including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and ash dispersion, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, tornado damage assessment, oil spills and disaster data mining. The Disasters team works with federal agencies to aid the government in meeting the challenges associated with natural disaster response and to transfer technologies to agencies as they become operational. Internationally, the Disasters Area also supports the Committee on Earth Observations Working Group on Disasters, and the International Charter on Space and Disasters to increase, strengthen, and coordinate contributions of NASA Earth-observing satellites and applications products to disaster risk management. The CEOS group will lead pilot efforts focused on identifying key systems to support flooding, earthquake, and volcanic events.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, Global Positioning System (GPS) has been frequently used as a scientific tool to detect potential earth mass movements and to track creeping landslides. In this study, we investigated four-years of continuous GPS data (September 2006-July 2010) recorded at a landslide site in Alaska. This GPS station (AC55) was installed on an un-identified creeping site by the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) project, which was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The landslide moves with a steady horizontal velocity of 5.5 cm/year toward NEE, and had a subsidence rate of 2.6 cm/year. There was a considerable correlation between annual snow loading and melting cycles and seasonal variations of the landslide displacements. The seasonal movements vary year to year with an average peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.5 cm and 1.0 cm in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. This study addresses three challenging issues in applying GPS for landslide monitoring in tectonically active and cold regions. The three challenges include (1) detecting GPS-derived positions that could be contaminated by the snow and ice accumulated on GPS antennas during cold seasons, (2) establishing a precise local reference frame and assessing its accuracy, and (3) excluding local seasonal ground motions from GPS-derived landslide displacements. The methods introduced in this study will be useful for GPS landslide monitoring in other tectonically active and/or cold regions.",

            "abstract": "Water scarcity presents a crucial challenge for water resource managers charged with maintaining hydrologic resources for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use while protecting natural systems. Forest lands are critical to the functioning of the hydrologic cycle in many watersheds, affecting the quantity, quality, and timing of water delivered to surface and groundwater systems. While the hydrologic impacts of forest growth and removal have been shown to be substantial in watersheds around the globe, data and models connecting forest management to water use and regional hydrology are generally lacking. We propose that water-focused forest management has the potential to deliver a “new” source of water to surface and groundwater resources. To test this hypothesis, we developed a statistical model of water yield in southeastern US pine stands as a function of forest stand structure and ecosystem water use. Model results suggest a potential increase in water yield of up to 64% for pine stands managed at lower basal areas relative to those managed according to standard silvicultural practices. At the watershed scale, the magnitude of this potential water yield enhancement is driven by existing land use and forest management; evaluated for a large watershed in NE Florida, this potential increase is in excess of 200 million gallons per day (equivalent to 20% of the anthropogenic water use in the watershed). While useful for exploration, our statistical model also highlighted critical sources of uncertainty, including the effects of climatic variation, between-site variability, water use in young pine stands, and prescribed fire. Thus, in ongoing work we are comparing the effects of specific land management actions (e.g., thinning, clearcutting, and fire) on water yield across a gradient of environmental conditions (soil type, aquifer confinement, and climate) using a novel combination of in-situ soil moisture and groundwater monitoring. These data are being used to derive management-water yield relationships to guide watershed-scale strategies for sustaining regional water resources in the southeastern US, which is facing projections of greater water scarcity driven both by a growing population and a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "Water shortages, and the prospect of such shortages, have been repeatedly faced and addressed as population and economic growth placed increasing demands on available water over the past century. Such challenges have been most common in arid areas, but also have been encountered in some more humid portions of the US during times of drought. The challenges have been met using a wide range of adaptation measures, from large infrastructure projects (e.g., major trans-basin diversions) to alterations in local water prices (e.g., increasing block pricing). The future may bring even greater adaptation challenges as, in addition to continued growth in population, climate change will reduce water supplies in many locations. In this study we report on the relative importance of changes in demand versus changes in supply in causing projected future shortages in basins throughout the contiguous U.S. under different sets of socioeconomic and climatic conditions. We then examine the degree to which projected shortages can be avoided through adaptation. The adaptations examined include reductions in demand of major water use sectors, alterations in water management infrastructure, and inter-basin water transfers.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic data indicate that faults offshore of Southern California accommodate 6-8 mm/yr of dextral Pacific-North American relative plate motion. In the Inner California Borderlands (ICB), modern strike-slip deformation is overprinted on topography formed during plate boundary reorganization 30-15 Ma. Despite its proximity to urban Southern California, the hazard posed by active faults in the ICB remains poorly understood.\nWe acquired a 4000-line-km regional grid of high-resolution, 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data and multibeam bathymetry to examine the fault architecture and tectonic evolution of the ICB. We interpret the MCS data using a sequence stratigraphic approach to establish a chronostratigraphy and identify discrete episodes of deformation. We present our results in a regional fault model that distinguishes active deformation from older structures.\nSignificant differences exist between our model of ICB deformation and existing models. Mounting evidence suggests a westward temporal migration of slip between faults in the ICB. In the eastern ICB, slip on the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon fault and the neighboring Coronado Bank fault (CBF) diminishes to the north and appears to decrease over time. Undeformed Late Pliocene sediments overlie the northern extent of the CBF and the breakaway zone of the purported Oceanside Blind Thrust. Therefore, CBF slip rate estimates based on linkage with the Palos Verdes fault to the north are unwarranted. Deformation along the San Mateo, San Onofre, and Carlsbad trends is best explained as localized deformation resulting from geometrical complexities in a dextral strike-slip fault system. In the western ICB, the San Diego Trough fault (SDTF) offsets young sediments between the US/Mexico border and the eastern margin of Avalon Knoll, where the fault is spatially coincident with the San Pedro Basin fault (SPBF). Farther west, the San Clemente fault (SCF) has a strong linear bathymetric expression. The length and simplicity of the SDTF and the SCF traces suggest that these faults may accommodate the majority of the contemporary ICB dextral deformation. Kinematic linkage between the SDTF and the SPBF increases the potential rupture length for earthquakes on either fault and may allow events nucleating on the SDTF to propagate much closer to the LA Basin.",

            "abstract": "The River Nile is the main source of fresh water in Egypt. Most of Egypt’s River Nile water (>85%) originates as precipitation over the Ethiopian highlands and is channeled by the Blue Nile. The construction (years: 2011 to 2017) of the Renaissance Dam (reservoir capacity: 70 x 109m3) on the Blue Nile poses an extreme threat to Egypt’s population. If the reservoir was to be filled in 7 years, Egypt will lose (during each of 7 years following dam completion) a minimum of 15 x 109m3 of its annual allocation (55 x 109m3) to reservoir filling (10 x 109m3), evaporation (3.5 x 109m3), and infiltration (1.5 x 109m3). Three solutions are proposed: Solution I takes advantage of the cyclicity of Nile floods and is based on findings from a calibrated (against temporal head data) unconfined 2-dimensional transient groundwater flow model for Lake Nasser and surroundings and a calibrated (against lake levels) surface water model. Models show with time: (1) losses to infiltration will decrease (1975-193: 58.4 109m3; 1993-2001: 43.6 x 109m3) due to silting of Lake bottom and encroachment of excess Lake Nasser water will increase (e.g., 1975-1993: none; 1993-2001: 17 x 109m3). We propose to develop sustainable agricultural in the Western Desert: (1) In high flood years, excess Lake Nasser water (e.g., 1993-2001: 17 x 109m3) is channeled across the plateau bounding (from west) the River Nile valley to artificially recharge the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) that crops out west of the plateau and, (2) in low flood years, we extract the recharged groundwater. Solution II calls on mining the NSAS at reasonable rates. Using temporal (January 2003 – September 2012) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data we estimate the annual depletion rates at 2 x 109m3 due to artificial extraction (1.5 x 109m3) and natural discharge (0.5 x 109m3). Assuming current GRACE depletion rates, the recoverable groundwater (5,180 x 109m3) will last for 2500 years; if we were to quadruple the artificial extraction rates (6 x 109m3), the reservoir will last for some 800 years. Solution III calls on the sustainable utilization of the NSAS groundwater in Sinai that receives an estimated minimum annual modern recharge of 13 x 106m3. Currently, these waters are lost as discharge in water bodies and/or diverted across political boundaries by major NE trending fault systems.",

How we can raise concern about climate change risks and enhance local readiness to adapt to climate change’s effects? In this presentation, we will share the lessons learned from the New England Climate Adaptation Project (NECAP), a participatory action research project that tested science-based role-play simulations as a tool for educating the public about climate change risks and simulating collective risk management efforts. NECAP was a 2-year effort involving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Consensus Building Institute, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System, and four coastal New England municipalities. During 2012-2013, the NECAP team produced downscaled climate change projections, a summary risk assessment, and a stakeholder assessment for each partner community. Working with local partners, we used these assessments to create a tailored, science-based role-play simulation for each site. Through a series of workshops in 2013, NECAP engaged between 115-170 diverse stakeholders and members of the public in each partner municipality in playing the simulation and a follow up conversation about local climate change risks and possible adaptation strategies. Data were collected through before-and-after surveys administered to all workshop participants, follow-up interviews with 25 percent of workshop participants, public opinion polls conducted before and after our intervention, and meetings with public officials. This presentation will report our research findings and explain how science-based role-play simulations can be used to help communicate local climate change risks and enhance local readiness to adapt.",

In this study we use available AERONET inversions (level 1.5) retrieved for the measuring period from 2009 to 2013, for the Arctic region (Eureka, Barrow and Hornsund), Urban/ Industrial regions (Kanpur, Beijing), and the forest regions (Alta Foresta and Mongu), to identify BrC aerosols. Using Dubovik’s inversion algorithm results, we analyzed parameters that were sensitive to BrC presence, notably AAOD, AAODBrC estimated using the approach of Arola et al. [2011], the fine-mode-aerosol absorption derivative (αf, abs) and the fine-mode-aerosol absorption 2nd derivative (αf, abs'), all computed at a near UV wavelength (440 nm). Temporal trends of these parameters were investigated for all test stations and compared to available volume sampling surface data as a means of validating / evaluating the sensitivity of ostensible sunphotometer indicators of BrC aerosols to the presence of BrC as measured using independent indicators.\n",

            "abstract": "Widespread use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate resource production from unconventional reservoirs necessitates the development of a fundamental understanding for this process. Our research focuses on a synthesis of three sets of data to better understand geochemical and mineralogic aspects of the process of hydraulic fracturing, including laboratory experiments, field data, and geochemical modeling. Experiments examine fluid-rock interaction using rock samples from the Niobrara and Frontier Formations, two unconventional reservoirs within the Powder River Basin of NE Wyoming. Experiments react reservoir rocks with a representative hydraulic fracturing fluid for 28 days at 115°C and 350 bars. Fresh water and common chemicals, including HCl and petroleum distillates, used in hydraulic fracturing comprise the experimental fluid. Mineral reaction to the acidic fluid (pH ~2.35) causes immediate buffering, bringing fluid pH to near-neutral conditions after ~6 hours. Al initially spikes in the first 6 hours by ~10X, but returns to lower concentrations within 12 hours. Fe, Ba, Co, Mn, Sb, and Cr follow similar trends. Contemporaneously, Sr, Mo, Li, W, V, and Rb increase dramatically and remain at elevated levels. Changes in trace element concentrations correlate with clay alteration, calcite dissolution, and feldspar dissolution observed within reacted rock samples. Fluid samples are compared to produced-water chemistry from active wells in the field, enhancing our understanding of geochemical reactions occurring at depth. Lastly, produced fluid chemistry from both field samples and experiments are tethered together using preliminary geochemical models. These models predict calcite and feldspar reaction as well as new clay formation. This research ties together a limited population of produced water data with reservoir mineralogy to enhance fundamental understanding of fluid-rock interactions in unconventional reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Physics-based watershed models are useful tools for hydrologic studies, water resources management and economic analyses in the contexts of climate, land-use, and water-use changes. This poster presents a parallel implementation of a quasi 3-dimensional, physics-based, high-resolution, distributed water resources model suitable for simulating large watersheds in a massively parallel computing environment. Developing this model is one of the objectives of the NSF EPSCoR RII Track II CI-WATER project, which is joint between Wyoming and Utah EPSCoR jurisdictions. The model, which we call ADHydro, is aimed at simulating important processes in the Rocky Mountain west, including: rainfall and infiltration, snowfall and snowmelt in complex terrain, vegetation and evapotranspiration, soil heat flux and freezing, overland flow, channel flow, groundwater flow, water management and irrigation. Model forcing is provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and ADHydro is coupled with the NOAH-MP land-surface scheme for calculating fluxes between the land and atmosphere. The ADHydro implementation uses the Charm++ parallel run time system. Charm++ is based on location transparent message passing between migrateable C++ objects. Each object represents an entity in the model such as a mesh element. These objects can be migrated between processors or serialized to disk allowing the Charm++ system to automatically provide capabilities such as load balancing and checkpointing. Objects interact with each other by passing messages that the Charm++ system routes to the correct destination object regardless of its current location. This poster discusses the algorithms, communication patterns, and caching strategies used to implement ADHydro with Charm++. The ADHydro model code will be released to the hydrologic community in late 2014.",

            "abstract": "One of the major challenges facing science in general is how foster trust and cooperation between nations that then allows the free and open exchange of data. The rich data coming from many nations conducting Arctic research must be allowed to be brought together to understand and assess the huge changes now underway in the Arctic regions.\nThe NCAR Earth Observing Laboratory has been supporting a variety of international field process studies and WCRP sponsored international projects that require international data collection and exchange in order to be successful. Some of the programs include the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) International Tundra Experiment (ITEX), the Arctic Climate Systems Study (ACSYS), the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO), and the Coordinated Energy and water-cycle Observations Project (CEOP) to name a few. EOL played a major role in the data management of these projects, but the CEOP effort in particular involved coordinating common site documentation and data formatting across a global network (28 sites). All these unique projects occurred over 25 years but had similar challenges in the international collection, archival, and access to the rich datasets that are their legacy.\nThe Belmont Forum offers as its main challenge to deliver knowledge needed for action to avoid or adapt to environmental change. One of their major themes is related to the study of these changes in the Arctic. The development of capable e-infrastructure (technologies and groups supporting international collaborative environments networks and data centers) to allow access to large diverse data collections is key to meeting this challenge.\nThe reality of meeting this challenge, however, is something much more difficult. The authors will provide several specific examples of successes and failures when trying to meet the needs of an international community of researchers specifically related to Belmont Forum Work Package Themes regarding standards of data sharing and open data. This will be done through the framework of the projects noted above in an environment of proprietary data claims, multiple formats and data collection procedures, stockpiling of data, international data restrictions and mistrust of other scientists.",

            "abstract": "Thinning due to ice flow acceleration, or dynamic thinning, caused by abrupt retreat of Greenland’s coastal outlet glaciers earlier in the century continues to propagate inland through diffusion. The rate of diffusion increases as the ice thickens and surface slopes decrease further into the interior, causing the mass loss to be spread over an ever increasing area, and the rate of thinning to decrease. Measurement of dynamic thinning and resulting mass loss with altimetry is thus becoming ever more challenging as the signal decreases relative to other potential sources of surface elevation change, particularly pre-existing dynamic imbalances and variations in surface and firn density, both of which are poorly constrained.\nWe combine observations from field campaigns, multiple air and spaceborne sensors, firn cores and climate model predictions to assess our ability to remotely measure dynamic thinning. Field measurements obtained in the percolation zone above Jakobshavn Isbrae indicate dynamic thinning has propagated nearly 250 km, or twice as far as detected by altimetry. This signal, however, is complicated by other variations that both mask the dynamic thinning signal and create substantial errors in the conversion from surface elevation change to mass change. We find a recent, rapid compaction of the firn layer due to increased melt has caused a surface elevation change of similar magnitude and spatial pattern as dynamic thinning. This compaction has occurred during a longer-term increase in accumulation, causing an inverse relationship between firn layer thickness and mass. We also detect a pre-existing, positive dynamic imbalance (i.e. flux convergence) in the interior of the catchment that offsets, and therefore masks, the inland propagation of thinning. Based on these findings, we discuss the limitations of altimetry for recovering the evolution of dynamic thinning and mass change and make recommendations for future improvements.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is not only producing food and other products. It is also a major economic sector, representing, especially in developing countries, an important part of GDP; and a major employer, with often more than half of the total workforce in many low income countries. In many of these countries irrigation plays a key role to increase and stabilize income, and it is likely to increase with climate change and increased variability of rain patterns. It is also a crucial mean to increase productivity of small holdings. In many countries, where holdings are small and even in some cases decreasing it is essential to enable farmers to ensure their food security and a decent income. In some countries, including India and many African countries, the workforce is expected to grow, with an important part of it to be employed in agriculture. At the same time many of the regions where agriculture is the most important from an economical and social point of view, are experiencing increasing water scarcity. In many cases, as has been noted for instance for the Mediterranean area, water availability is the main limiting factor to agricultural development. Increasingly agriculture is also in competition for water use with other economic activities.\nThis calls for means to assess and compare agricultural productions systems and irrigation projects not only in terms of physical production of agricultural products but also in terms of income and jobs generated by the activity. In this study, we propose a methodology based on the blue water footprint for assessing and comparing different agricultural productions and farming systems in terms of economic and social outcomes for a given volume of blue water. Examples are drawn from the Campania region of Italy and based on data extracted from the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). This database contains, among other, data on crop production, irrigation management (irrigated surface, length of irrigation season, volumes of water, etc.), as well as on income and labor.",

During its first flight FOXSI observed imaged a microflare with simultaneous observations by RHESSI. We present recent imaging analysis of the FOXSI observations and detailed comparison with RHESSI.

Our overarching objective is to create utilities that automate the mundane aspects of satellite data analysis, are extensible and maintainable, and do not place limitations on the analysis itself. IDL has a powerful suite of statistical and visualization tools that can be used in conjunction with SatelliteDL.\nToward this end we have constructed SatelliteDL to include\n(1) HTML and LaTeX API document generation,\n(2) a unit test framework,\n(3) automatic message and error logs,\n(4) HTML and LaTeX plot and table generation, and\n(5) several real world examples with bundled datasets available for download.\nFor ease of use, datasets, variables and optional workflows may be specified in a flexible format configuration file. Configuration statements may specify, for example, a region and date range, and the creation of images, plots and statistical summary tables for a long list of variables.\nSatelliteDL enforces data provenance; all data should be traceable and reproducible. The output NetCDF file metadata holds a complete history of the original datasets and their transformations, and a method exists to reconstruct a configuration file from this information.\nRelease 0.1.0 distributes with ingest methods for GOES, MODIS, VIIRS and CERES radiance data (L1) as well as select 2D atmosphere products (L2) such as aerosol and cloud (MODIS and VIIRS) and radiant flux (CERES).\nFuture releases will provide ingest methods for ocean and land surface products, gridded and time averaged datasets (L3 Daily, Monthly and Yearly), and support for 3D products such as temperature and water vapor profiles.\nEmphasis will be on NPP Sensor, Environmental and Climate Data Records as they become available.\nTo obtain SatelliteDL, please visit the project website at http://www.txcorp.com/SatelliteDL",

Studying how patterns influence fluxes and state variables across scales is a key goal of the Collaborative Research Centre TR32, which approaches this challenge by monitoring, modelling and data assimilation using the Rur catchment (Germany) as its study area.\nThe evolution of system state variables across scales is monitored using two dual-polarized X-band Doppler radars as well as the atmospheric boundary layer, cloud and precipitation monitoring site JOYCE (Jülich ObservatorY for Cloud Evolution), and measurements from eddy covariance stations, an extensive soil moisture network including cosmic-ray probes. Monitoring is complemented by a suite of geophysical methods such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Spectral Induced Polarization, Electromagnetic Induction, and Ground-Penetrating Radar, as well as a rhizotrone facility set up to monitor root development in conjunction with plant growth.\nThe TR32 employs multi-compartment modelling to upscale the water, CO2 and energy fluxes from the local to the catchment scale. The analysis of the simulations with grids that honor the respective scales reveal the role of patterns on the fluxes and helps to design a general upscaling framework that quantifies information transfer between scales.\nModel development centers around the coupled model platform TerrSysMP, which considers mutual fluxes from the groundwater to the atmosphere by combining the atmospheric model COSMO, the land surface model CLM, and the hydrological model ParFlow in a scale-consistent way using the OASIS coupler. Processes down to the root scale are modelled at high resolution in order to obtain improved parameterizations for TerrSysMP. State variable assimilation and parameter estimation methods are extended to the complete terrestrial system. We will present selected results and challenges for the prediction of states and fluxes of water, CO2 and energy in terrestrial systems across scales.",

            "abstract": "The first successful attempt to instrument an Ocean Drilling Program borehole for formation pressure and temperature monitoring and fluid sampling was accomplished in 1991 in Hole 857D, and the system there has been in nearly continuous operation since that time. This hole and others that followed have provided many new insights into ocean crustal and subduction zone hydrogeology and geodynamics, while at the same time being the “proving ground” for a number of technological advances in ocean borehole monitoring, including 1) the CORK scheme itself for sealing holes for hydrologic recovery to natural-state conditions after drilling; 2) the use of absolute pressure sensors for monitoring both relative formation pressures and changes in seafloor depth; 3) multi-level completions for pressure monitoring that leave cased borehole interiors open for other instrumentation; 4) the development of ultra-high-precision, low-power digital recording systems for examining the effects on the formation of seismic and microseismic loading; and 5) the proof-of-concept of an optical communications system that eliminates dependence on submersibles or ROVs for data download operations (see Tivey et al., this session). Relatively low-sample-rate data spanning the first part of the more than two decades of operations have shown how large anomalous pressures generated thermally and by deformation can be; how seafloor tidal loading influences formation pressure and can drive an “a.c.” component of flow; and how seismogenic and slow strain can be observed by way of formation-fluid pressure transients. More recent instrumentation has allowed much higher fidelity observations (1 Hz sampling at a resolution of 10-8 of full-scale), and thus is permitting complementary studies of hydrologic, oceanographic, seismic, and microseismic phenomena. Plans for the future include connections to shore via observatory cable systems, such as those of NEPTUNE Canada and DONET, for unlimited power supply and real-time data acquisition (the first having been connected in 2009), and incorporation of quartz sensors, under development at Paroscientific Inc. and Quartz Seismic Sensors Inc., that are coupled to acceleration for monitoring tilt and ground motion.",

            "abstract": "Earth, Venus, Mars and some of the largest asteroids have massive silicate mantles surrounding iron cores, and chondritic compositions. Against this backdrop are anomalies like the iron planet Mercury, and the Moon with almost no core, and metallic asteroids like Psyche. The Moon can be explained by giant impact, but for Mercury a giant impact (Benz et al., Icarus 1988) is problematic. Mercury must retain substantial volatiles after its obliteration (e.g. Peplowski et al., Science 2011), and must somehow avoid accreting its ejected silicates (Gladman and Coffey, MAPS 2009).\nSPH simulations have shown (Asphaug and Reufer, Nature Geosciences 2014; Sarid et al., LPSC 2014) that a differentiated chondritic proto-Mercury about 3 times its present mass can be stripped of its mantle in one energetic hit and run collision with a larger planet (proto-Venus or proto-Earth). To preserve Mercury's volatiles we also consider the scenario of lower energy hit and runs, in succession. We show that if 20 Mars-like planets accreted stochastically to form Venus and the Earth, then the statistics of attrition is likely to lead to one planet (Mercury) expressing repeated mantle stripping, and another planet (Mars) relatively undisturbed.\nFor iron asteroids the \"missing mantle paradox\" likewise looms prominent. Where does it go, and how do we strip away so much mantle rock (in some cases down to a bare iron core; Yang et al., Nature 2007, Moskovitz et al., EPSL 2011) while leaving asteroids like Vesta presumably intact? According to the hit and run hypothesis, the sink for all this missing silicate is the larger accreted bodies at the top of the feeding chain, as they win the pairwise dynamical competition for stripped materials. This exotic origin of relics is only relevant to those few pairwise encounters that do not accrete both bodies. So the small survivors are lucky, and how they are lucky -- their attrition bias -- is manifested as compositional diversity and a preponderance of iron relics.",

            "abstract": "Moist tropical forests have the highest soil respiration rates (Rs) of any terrestrial ecosystem and account for approximately one third of the world’s soil carbon (C) pool. Small increases in the magnitude of Rs in these ecosystems can result in high rates of soil C loss, with significant consequences for global climate change. Identifying the climatic controls of Rs in moist subtropical forests will improve our ability to predict how this large C flux will respond to climate change. Our objectives were (1) to determine whether Rs varies on diel timescales, (2) whether diel Rs patterns vary seasonally, and (3) identify biophysical drivers of this temporal variation. We measured hourly Rs in a secondary, moist subtropical forest in Puerto Rico for a 3-year period using an automated soil respiration system (LI-COR 8100/8150 with six chambers). Concomitant with Rs we measured hourly variation in several climatic drivers (air/soil temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation). Soil respiration showed significant diel variation, with the magnitude, amplitude, and shape of these curves varying throughout the year. Overall, diel Rs peaked in the late afternoon and reached a minimum in the early morning. Diel amplitudes ranged from 1 to 7 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1, with larger amplitudes occurring in warmer months that also have higher rates of Rs. In warmer months Rs exhibited a strong bimodal pattern, and a narrower diel range with a single peak in cooler and drier months. Diel Rs was positively correlated with soil temperature, but this relationship was non-linear during the day and linear at night (i.e., hysteresis). The bimodal pattern of Rs may be due to a mid-day depression of photosynthesis when humidity is low and air temperature is high, thereby reducing transport of photosynthate to the roots and decreasing rhizospheric respiration. The hysteresis between Rs and temperature suggests multiple controls on Rs on diel time-scales. Research that partitions Rs into its components could provide insight into their respective sensitivities to different climatic drivers, improving our capacity to understand the effects of climate change on the tropical forest C cycle.",

            "abstract": "We have proposed a 3U cubesat, to carry a low-frequency radio receiver into low-Earth orbit to study solar radio bursts induced by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections. Because of the reflective properties of the Earth’s ionosphere, observations of radio waves around and below 10 MHz must be made from space. The measurements will allow continuous tracking of radio bursts and associated CMEs through the inner heliosphere. These observations are important since such events are the main cause for space weather disturbances. Data products from the mission will primarily be spectra and waveforms of solar radio type II and III bursts, and the direction to the radio source as it propagates through the inner heliosphere. These data products will be available to the community through an automated pipeline nominally within a few hours of downlink. Additional science data products will be sizes of radio sources obtained via lunar occultations, and local ionospheric plasma density and electron temperature. As a first cubesat with a scientific radio instrument at these frequencies, this project is also intended as a path-finder: the instrument and sub-systems can immediately be duplicated in other cubesats, with the goal of providing the first radio interferometric measurements below the ionospheric cutoff.",

            "abstract": "From February to May 2014, NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer conducted a telepresence-enabled ocean exploration expedition addressing NOAA and National deepwater priorities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The community-driven expedition connected diverse and geographically dispersed audiences including scientists from industry, academia, and government, and educators, students, and the general public. Expedition planning included input from the ocean science and management community, and was executed with more than 70 scientists and students from 14 U.S. states participating from shore in real time.\nTraining the next generation permeated operations: a mapping internship program trained undergraduate and graduate students; an ROV mentorship program trained young engineers to design, build and operate the system; and undergraduate through doctoral students around the country collaborated with expedition scientists via telepresence.\nOnline coverage of the expedition included background materials, daily updates, and mission logs that received more than 100,000 visits by the public. Live video feeds of operations received more than 700,000 views online. Additionally, professional development workshops hosted in multiple locations throughout the spring introduced educators to the Okeanos Explorer Educational Materials Collection and the live expedition, and taught them how to use the website and education resources in their classrooms.\nSocial media furthered the reach of the expedition to new audiences, garnered thousands of new followers and provided another medium for real-time interactions with the general public. Outreach continued through live interactions with museums and aquariums, Exploration Command Center tours, outreach conducted by partners, and media coverage in more than 190 outlets in the U.S. and Europe. Ship tours were conducted when the ship came in to port to engage local scientists, ocean managers, and educators. After the expedition, data and products were archived and quickly shared with ocean managers and scientists working in the region, providing a baseline of publicly available data and stimulating follow-on exploration, research and management activities within a few months of expedition completion.",

            "abstract": "The Lodo Formation (central CA), records the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) associated with the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in a continental margin setting, where increased sedimentation rates - attributed to an enhanced hydrological cycle - provide a means for significant carbon drawdown after the peak of this hyperthermal event (John et al. 2008). This study investigates variations in grain size associated with the recovery from peak CIE values to better constrain the potential mechanism of the apparent increase in sedimentation rates, which can shed light on climate dynamics and feedbacks associated with other warming events.\nWe collected bulk samples at ~10 cm increments over a stratigraphic interval that encompasses the previously documented CIE onset, peak, and recovery phases. We used a laser diffraction particle size analyzer on disaggregated samples to permit detection of variation within clay and silt sediment size fractions (2-63 microns) in addition to sand-size grains. Results show that, while the onset and peak CIE is associated with abundant clays, the recovery interval preserves a marked shift in median grain size to coarse silt and very fine sand. Ongoing work indicates that the grain size increase is not associated with an increase in foraminiferal abundance.\nEnhanced terrigenous sediment delivery during the CIE recovery could explain both the increase in grain size (this study) and sedimentation rates (previous work). This increased sediment supply could be attributed to (1) increased seasonality and storm intensity during the hyperthermal, (2) marine regression (i.e. basinward shift in shoreline) associated with decreasing rates of sea level rise during sea level highstand, or some combination of these factors. Future work to document compositional and preservational changes in sediments and foraminifera over this time interval will aid in teasing apart the relative influence of potential drivers of change associated with this event.",

            "abstract": "Geophysics has become a common tool in the last two decades to supplement the lack of groundwater (GW) data for GW models calibration. One of the common applications is investigating the solute transport processes such as seawater intrusion, which, under certain geological conditions, is a good target for electromagnetic methods. Combining these two different sources of data, however, is still subject of ongoing investigation. One of the caveats is the different scales of geophysical and GW models, as well as the empirical petrophysical relationships that relate geophysical and groundwater states. Solving the parameter estimation problem in this field adds even more complexity, and careful analysis of the potential and the limitations of such an inverse problem should therefore precede the collection of field data.\nWe developed a 3D groundwater model for variable density flow in Matlab based on discretized flow and solute mass balance equations. In conjunction with the GW model, a geophysical model was developed for 3D electromagnetic modeling and inversion in the time domain. Having both models in the same environment makes the implementation of coupling easier. In our inverse problem, we assume we can collect data for both geophysical and groundwater processes and that we have some information about groundwater model parameters. The unknown parameter can be initial or current solute content depending on the available data.\nIn the joint inversion framework the data misfit error was minimized for both models at the same time. To achieve this we derived the sensitivities of collected data w.r.t to the solute content (and soil bulk conductivity) based on discretized system of equations. This helps to reduce the computational burden of the problem but also gives insights about experiment setup. The objective function then consists of data misfit and regularization terms but also coupling term that relates groundwater and geophysical states. The coupling term can be represented by Archie's law, if known, or just by some similarity measure (e.g. cross gradient field product). Due to the synthetic character of our example we can compare the results with other coupled inversion frameworks and also just separate inversion by either groundwater or geophysical model.",

Our new method avoids the non-differentiability of the total-variation regularization scheme, and improves the robustness of waveform inversion. We use time-lapse seismic data for joint inversion to reduce inversion artifacts outside target monitoring regions. Two walkaway vertical seismic profiling (VSP) datasets were acquired at the SACROC enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) field in Texas in 2008 and 2009 for monitoring CO2 injection and migration. We apply our new double-difference waveform inversion method to the SACROC time-lapse VSP datasets. Our joint inversion result reveals a region with seismic-wave velocities lower than the other regions in the reservoir. This velocity decrease is caused by CO2 injection and migration.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate records from fossil corals provide valuable benchmarks for climate model simulations of tropical climate variability. Unfortunately, the number of such reconstructions is limited by the rarity of the relatively large fossil coral heads that are targeted for paleoclimate studies. Abundant, albeit shorter (5-10yrs-long) fossil coral sequences could be used to generate a more robust, quasi-continuous reconstruction of tropical climate with built-in uncertainty estimates, but the large number of radiometric dates required is costly. A new rapid-screen 14C dating method, with a nominal precision of ±1.8% (1σ) for young carbonates (Bush et al., 2013), is roughly 10 times faster than high-precision U/Th dating, making it well-suited to screening a large number of corals. In this study, we compare rapid-screen 14C dates to both high-precision 14C dates and U/Th dates from well-characterized mid- to late-Holocene fossil corals collected from Christmas and Fanning Islands (2-4°N, 157-160°W) (Cobb et al., 2013). Our results show that most rapid-screen 14C dates agree with high-precision 14C dates (N=3) and U/Th dates (N=42), within combined uncertainties. However, two samples that contain 15 and 23% calcite (as determined by XRD) are associated with large discrepancies in calibrated 14C vs published U/Th ages (5065-5579 yBP (2σ) versus 6350 ±13 yBP (2σ) and 4868-5424 yBP (2σ) vs 6598 ±13 yBP (2σ)), respectively (Cobb et al., 2013). The 14C-U/Th mismatches, as well as poor reproducibility of replicate U/Th dates from these samples, are consistent with diagenetic alteration indicated by the presence of calcite. Mass balance calculations indicate that the dating discrepancies can be explained by a combination of 14C addition and U removal, both of which can occur through calcite recrystallization during freshwater diagenesis. Results illustrate that the rapid-screen 14C dating method is well-suited to surveying a large number (~100’s) of fossil coral samples, provided that samples are pre-screened for calcite. Beyond that, concordance between paired 14C and U/Th dates provides valuable confirmation of closed-system behavior and chronological accuracy.",

To help answer these and other questions, the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field project was conducted during the spring of 2012. On 29 May 2012, observations of an Oklahoma supercell were collected by two mobile SMART-R radars, the mobile NOXP radar, multiple NEXRAD radars, the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), and the NSF/NCAR HIAPER and NASA DC-8 aircraft. In this study, data from the mobile and NEXRAD radars are assimilated into the NSSL COMMAS model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter, beginning shortly after initiation of convection and ending when the aircraft made their final measurements of the storm's outflow. The model analyses produce a realistic representation of the kinematic character of the storm throughout this time period. COMMAS includes the NSSL multimoment microphysics, explicit cloud electrification, and a branched lightning discharge scheme, which is used to produce LNOx within the model via a method dependent upon air pressure and lightning channel length. Model results will be presented and compared to radar, lightning, and aircraft observations. Of particular importance, the vertical distribution of lightning, channel length of lightning, and LNOx production and transport in the model will be analyzed and compared to LMA observations and anvil-level outflow observations from the aircraft. In addition, to examine entrainment and detrainment of air by the storm and to provide a check on LNOx production and transport, trajectory analyses will be presented and the transport of inert trace gases such as carbon monoxide in the model will be analyzed and compared to aircraft measurements.",

The Orca Basin, a 2400 meter deep bathymetric depression on the continental slope of the north-central Gulf of Mexico, is an ideal environment to examine how redox-dependent biochemical processes control the input and cycling of bacterial and archaea-derived lipid compounds from formation in near-surface water, through secondary recycling processes operating at the redox-transition in the water column, to sedimentary diagenetic processes operating in oxic to anoxic zones within the basin. The lowermost 180 meters of the Orca Basin is characterized by an anoxic, hypersaline brine that is separated from the overlying oxic seawater by a well-defined redox sequence associated with a systematic increasing in salinity from 35 – 250‰. While surface water conditions are viewed as normal marine with a seasonally productive water column, the sub-oxic to anoxic transition zones within the deep-water column and the sediment spans over 200 m allowing the unique opportunity for discrete sampling of resident organisms and lipids.\nHere we present 16s rRNA sequence data of Bacteria and Archaea collected parallel to GDGT lipid profiles and in situ environmental measurements from the sediment and overlying water column in the intermediate zone of the basin, where movements of chemical transition zones are preserved. We evaluated GDGTs and corresponding taxa across the surface water, chlorophyll maximum, thermocline, and the deep redox boundary, including oxygenation, denitrification, manganese, iron and sulfate reduction zones, to determine if GDGTs are being produced under these conditions and how surface-derived GDGT lipids and the TEX86 signal may be altered.

            "abstract": "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale and faint propagating disturbances observed in the solar corona, frequently associated with coronal mass ejections and flares. Since their discovery over two hundred papers discussing their properties, causes and physics have been published. However, their fundamental nature and the physics of their interactions with other solar phenomena are still not understood. To further the understanding of EUV waves, and their relation to other solar phenomena, we are developing AWARE - the Automated Wave Analysis and REduction algorithm for the detection of EUV waves over the full Sun. AWARE is a Python-based, open-source algorithm that utilizes the SunPy data analysis package and general purpose signal processing libraries. The core detection algorithm is based on a novel image processing approach to isolating the bright wavefront of the EUV as it propagates across the confounding background emission of the complex structured solar corona. The location, speed and acceleration of the wavefront as a function of direction from the source events are calculated. We describe the core image processing steps of the AWARE algorithm, and demonstrate its application to observational data from SDO/AIA and STEREO/EUVI.",

            "abstract": "Continents grow as crustal terranes of various ages and origins accreted together. Suture zones mark the boundaries of these terranes and provide a discrete marker to investigate the process of continental growth. Investigating continental structure, we can identify whether properties such as crustal thickness or seismic wavespeed changes across suture zones. Further comparison between the locations of sutures and the distribution of tectonic events provides insight into the degree that sutures serve to localize regions of tectonism. In this study we investigate the mid continent of North America, where crust of the Mazatzal and Granite Rhyolite terranes accreted together to make up the Proterozoic basement. Using seismic data from the EarthScope Transportable Array and OIINK FlexArray, we inspect receiver functions and Rayleigh wave phase velocities to investigate lithospheric structures. Through this analysis, we identify a zone where the crust thickens from an average near 40 km, to more than 50 km in an area that encompasses the Illinois-Missouri border and lies along the suture zone between these two Proterozoic terranes. However, the wavespeeds of the crust do not appear to vary between the terranes or in the zone of crustal thickening. The boundary between the Ozark Plateau and Illinois Basin is located within the area of thickened crust and may indicate a potential role played by the suture zone in the formation of these two epiorogenic features. The dense mafic intrusions that were added to the crust during extension of the failed Reelfoot Rift, and now exhibit high seismic wavespeeds, may have provided the additional load that allowed the Illinois Basin to exploit the already weakened suture zone and subside. Diffuse seismicity in the St. Genevieve Fault Zone, which is located to the north of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, lies near the western edge of the area of thickened crust and suggests that ancient suture zones influence modern deformation within continental interiors.",

            "abstract": "Inspired by the current drought and concerns about maintaining water storage capacity, California State Senate this year passed SB1259, directing the Department of Water Resources to assess the state’s reservoirs for sedimentation problems. The need to actively manage sediment in reservoirs is increasingly recognized, as valuable reservoir storage capacity is lost and downstream reaches suffer from sediment starvation, manifesting problems such as channel incision, accelerated erosion of deltas, and loss of gravels important for habitat. With increased dam construction globally, these impacts will be widespread. Despite the opportunities to pass sediment through or around reservoirs (to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts), these sustainable approaches to managing sediment are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. From a workshop involving international and Chinese experts and review of recent literature, collective global experience in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation suggest that sediment management can be classified as catchment management (to reduce sediment inflow), sediment removal, and sediment routing through or around the reservoir. Sediment routing has the virtues of maintaining sediment flows to downstream reaches, as well as preserving reservoir capacity. Where geometry is favorable, sediment can often be bypassed around the reservoir (avoiding reservoir sedimentation and supplying sediment to downstream reaches) or sluiced through large-capacity outlets after flowing rapidly through the reservoir to avoid sedimentation. In narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients, sediments accumulated in the reservoir can often be re-suspended and flushed through when the reservoir is drawn down. Turbidity currents can often be ‘vented’ through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, the expert group recommended that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.",

            "abstract": "Fractured shale formations that have been drained of hydrocarbons could serve as attractive sites for geologic sequestration of CO2. Shales preferentially sorb CO2 enabling greater storage potential than would be expected based only on the pores vacated during CH4 production. Sequestration in shales could have a variety of other benefits because the intrinsically low permeability of the rock could help mitigate leakage risks and infrastructure resources could be leveraged to minimize costs. Here a modeling framework developed by the authors to estimate the sequestration capacity of fractured shale formations based on CH4 production rates was applied to the Utica Shale. The model is based on a unipore transport model, which assumes that diffusion of gases into and out of the kerogen matrix will control gas transport. The results from the Utica formation were compared to estimates for sequestration in the Marcellus shale to understand how the petrophysical characteristics of these two formations impact estimated sequestration capacity. A detailed sensitivity analysis was carried out to link modeling assumptions and key parameters with known physicochemical characteristics of these two shale formations. Modeling parameters were derived from published production data obtained from the state of Ohio.\nThe model was found to be most sensitive to the equilibrium sorption parameters of CH4 and CO2, for which there is good literature data available. Published values for CO2 sorption varied considerably based on the composition of the shale. Improved experimental data is needed to provide the most accurate estimates of storage in different formations. Differences were observed in gas diffusivity estimates for the Marcellus and Utica shale that could be understood in terms of the petrophysical characteristics of the two formations. We also found important effects tied to the effective diffusion length out of an average pore in the kerogen. These results allow us to understand how this modeling framework, which captures the underlying physical transport processes, is computationally efficient and it can be run using readily available data sources, will compare to more complex models of sequestration in shales.",

Riparian areas offers wildlife habitat and stream water quality, offers bank stability and protects against erosions, provides aesthetics and recreational value, and other numerous valuable ecosystem functions. Quantifying and delineating riparian areas is an essential step in riparian monitoring, riparian management/planning and policy decisions, and in preserving its valuable ecological functions. Previous approaches to riparian areas mapping have primarily utilized fixed width buffers. However, these methodologies only take the watercourse into consideration and ignore critical geomorphology, associated vegetation and soil characteristics. Other approaches utilize remote sensing technologies such as aerial photos interpretation or satellite imagery riparian vegetation classification. Such techniques requires expert knowledge, high spatial resolution data, and expensive when mapping riparian areas on a landscape scale. The goal of this study is to develop a cost effective robust workflow to consistently map the geographic extent and composition of riparian areas within the Hiawatha National Forest boundary utilizing the Riparian Buffer Delineation Model (RBDM) v3.0 and open source geospatial data. This approach recognizes the dynamic and transitional natures of riparian areas by accounting for hydrologic, geomorphic and vegetation data as inputs into the delineation process and the results would suggests incorporating functional variable width riparian mapping within watershed management planning to improve protection and restoration of valuable riparian functionality and biodiversity.",

Here we report on an airborne transient electromagnetic survey in Antarctica, which for the first time produced extensive imagery of subsurface resistivity in Taylor Valley, an ice-free margin of the Ross Sea. Wide zones of low subsurface resistivity were detected that are inconsistent with the typical high resistivity of glacier ice or dry permafrost. These results are interpreted as an indication that water, with sufficiently high solute content to remain unfrozen well below 0°C, temperatures considered within the range suitable for microbial life. The inferred subsurface brines are widespread and form two isolated groundwater systems: a near shore system, which extends from the ocean 18 km inland; and a sub-/proglacial system, which emanates from beneath Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney and is associated with the discharge from Blood Falls. The brine networks in Taylor Valley challenge the notion that groundwater is negligible in regions of continuous permafrost, and signify the potential for a deep biosphere that is hydrologically and geochemically connected to the marine system and subglacial environments.",

During Year 1, an Assembly of seven stakeholder groups representing the broad EarthCube community developed a draft Governance Framework. Finalized at the June 2014 EarthCube All Hands Meeting, this framework will be tested during the demonstration phase in Year 2, beginning October 2014.\nA brief overview of the framework: Community-elected members of the EarthCube Leadership Council will be responsible for managing strategic direction and identifying the scope of EarthCube. Three Standing Committees will also be established to oversee the development of technology and architecture, to coordinate among new and existing data facilities, and to represent the academic geosciences community in driving development of EarthCube cyberinfrastructure. An Engagement Team and a Liaison Team will support communication and partnerships with internal and external stakeholders, and a central Office will serve a logistical support function to the governance as a whole. Finally, ad hoc Working Groups and Special Interest Groups will take on other issues related to EarthCube’s goals.\nThe Year 2 demonstration phase will test the effectiveness of the proposed framework and allow for elements to be changed to better meet community needs. It will begin by populating committees and teams, and finalizing leadership and decision-making processes to move forward on community-selected priorities including identifying science drivers, coordinating emerging technical elements, and coming to convergence on system architecture. A January mid-year review will assemble these groups to analyze the effectiveness of the framework and make adjustments as necessary. If successful, this framework will move EarthCube forward as a collaborative platform and potentially act as a model for future NSF investments in geoscience cyberinfrastructure.",

The CrIS instrument on NASA's Suomi-NPP platform supplements this record in the 1:30 polar orbit, starting in 2012, and may continue for 15 years under the NOAA/NASA JPSS Program. The first of three IASI hyperspectral sounders on EUMETSAT's METOP platforms (9:30 orbit) started operation in July 2007, followed by the 2nd IASI on METOP-2 in early 2013. Development of a follow-on instrument (IASI-NG) for post METOP-3 is well underway.\nThese instruments are sensitive to the atmospheric temperature and humidity profile, surface temperature and emissivity, and minor gases (CO2, O3, CO, CH4, N2O, CFCs, HNO3, etc.) They also have high sensitivity to clouds, especially long-wave cloud radiative forcing. The National Research Council has recommended the development of a hyperspectral IR radiance climate data set as a climate benchmark. We present here evidence that supports the use of the existing hyperspectral sounders for generation of these ESDRs and eventually CDRs. The large spatial and temporal overlap between these sensors has provided a rich data-set for inter-calibration studies that are used to characterize the accuracy of a combined ESDR radiance product.\nWe will discuss the stability of each instrument, and inter-calibration differences (with error estimates). In addition, we have developed robust, non-statistical approaches for converting the AIRS spectral radiances into equivalent CrIS radiances, a key step in development of a long-term consistent radiance record. Finally, several examples of robust decadal changes in the earth's atmosphere using AIRS will be discussed and compared to ERA and MERRA re-analysis products (temperature, water vapor, cloud forcing). Finally, we will review the challenges involved in creating an ESDR from 3 different instruments and institutions/countries.",

            "abstract": "Remarkably, drilling in Landsvirkjun Co.’s geothermal field in Krafla Caldera, Iceland has encountered rhyolite magma or hypersolidus rhyolite at 2.1–2.5 km depth in 3 wells distributed over 3.5 km2, including Iceland Deep Drilling Program’s IDDP-1 (Mortensen, 2012). Krafla’s most recent rifting and eruption (basalt) episode was 1975-1984; deformation since that time has been simple decay. Apparently rhyolite magma was either emplaced during that episode without itself erupting or quietly evolved in situ within 2-3 decades. Analysis of drill cuttings containing quenched melt from IDDP-1 yielded unprecedented petrologic data (Zierenberg et al, 2012). But interpreting active processes of heat and mass transfer requires knowing spatial variations in physical and chemical characteristics at the margin of the magma body, and that requires retrieving core - a not-inconceivable task. Core quenched in situ in melt up to 1150oC was recovered from Kilauea Iki lava lake, Hawaii by the Magma Energy Project >30 years ago. The site from which IDDP-1 was drilled, and perhaps IDDP-1 itself, may be available to attempt the first-ever coring of rhyolite magma, now proposed as the Krafla Magma Drilling Project (KMDP). KMDP would also include geophysical and geochemical experiments to measure the response of the magma/hydrothermal system to fluid injection and flow tests. Fundamental results will reveal the behavior of magma in the upper crust and coupling between magma and the hydrothermal system. Extreme, sustained thermal power output during flow tests of IDDP-1 suggests operation of a Kilauea-Iki-like freeze-fracture-flow boundary propagating into the magma and mining its latent heat of crystallization (Carrigan et al, EGU, 2014). Such an ultra-hot Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) might be developable beneath this and other magma-heated conventional hydrothermal systems. Additionally, intra-caldera intrusions like Krafla’s are believed to produce the unrest that is so troubling in populated calderas (e.g., Campi Flegrei, Italy). Experiments with the live system will aid in hazard assessment and eruption forecasting for this most difficult of volcano hazard problems. We will report on an International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) workshop held to assess feasibility and to develop a plan for KMDP.",

Innovative 3D visualization techniques and real-time augmented user interfaces enable students to create realistic environments to understand the world around them. Here, we present a series of laboratory activities that utilize an Augmented Reality Sandbox to teach basic concepts of hydrology, geology, and geography to undergraduates at Harvard University and the University of Redlands.\nThe Augmented Reality (AR) Sandbox utilizes a real sandbox that is overlain by a digital projection of topography and a color elevation map. A Microsoft Kinect 3D camera feeds altimetry data into a software program that maps this information onto the sand surface using a digital projector. Students can then manipulate the sand and observe as the Sandbox augments their manipulations with projections of contour lines, an elevation color map, and a simulation of water. The idea for the AR Sandbox was conceived at MIT by the Tangible Media Group in 2002 and the simulation software used here was written and developed by Dr. Oliver Kreylos of the University of California – Davis as part of the NSF funded LakeViz3D project. Between 2013 and 2014, we installed AR Sandboxes at Harvard and the University of Redlands, respectively, and developed laboratory exercises to teach flooding hazard, erosion and watershed development in undergraduate earth and environmental science courses.\nIn 2013, we introduced a series of AR Sandbox laboratories in Introductory Geology, Hydrology, and Natural Disasters courses. We found laboratories that utilized the AR Sandbox at both universities allowed students to become quickly immersed in the learning process, enabling a more intuitive understanding of the processes that govern the natural world. The physical interface of the AR Sandbox reduces barriers to learning, can be used to rapidly illustrate basic concepts of geology, geography and hydrology, and enabled our undergraduate students to understand topography intuitively. We therefore find the AR Sandbox to be a novel teaching tool and an effective demonstration of the capabilities of 3D visualization and real-time augmented user interfaces that enable students to better understand environmental processes.",

            "abstract": "Deposition to the sea surface represents a major atmospheric removal mechanism for sulfur dioxide and many other highly soluble products of tropospheric photochemistry. Such gases include nitric acid, ammonia, organic acids, sulfur dioxide, and highly soluble organic compounds such as methanol and acetone. The deposition of highly soluble gases is controlled by turbulent and diffusive transport on the air side of the air/sea interface. In this study, air/sea fluxes of the soluble gas sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), sensible and latent heat, and momentum were measured using eddy covariance. This was a pilot study carried out in April 2014 on Scripps pier in La Jolla, California, that was designed to assess the potential for measuring SO2 fluxes over the ocean. SO2 was detected using chemical ion mass spectrometry in negative ion mode with a sensitivity of roughly 100 Hz/ppt. The ionization scheme involved addition of ozone to a dried air stream and subsequent conversion of SO2 to the SO5 - ion. The results demonstrate the feasibility of seagoing SO2 flux measurements. Such measurements can be used to constrain the depositional velocities of soluble gases and test models for air-side resistance to air/sea gas transfer.",

            "abstract": "The importance of floodplains as links between watersheds and rivers highlights the need to understand water and carbon fluxes within floodplain profiles, from their surface soil, through the vadose zone and underlying groundwater. Here, we present results of field and laboratory measurements conducted to quantify fluxes at a remediated uranium/vanadium mill tailings site on a floodplain at Rifle, Colorado. This semi-arid site has a vegetated, locally derived fill soil that replaced the original milling-contaminated soil to a depth of about 1.5 m. The fill soil overlies about 4.5 m of native sandy and cobbly alluvium containing the shallow aquifer. The aquifer generally drains into the Colorado River and is underlain by low permeability Wasatch Formation shale. Within this system, key issues being investigated include water and carbon fluxes between the vadose zone and aquifer, and CO2 fluxes through the vadose zone soil out to the atmosphere. Magnitudes of these fluxes are typically low, thus challenging to measure, yet increasingly important to quantify given the expansion of arid and semi-arid regions under changing climate.\nThe results of field investigations demonstrated that the annual water table rise and fall are driven by snowmelt runoff into the Colorado River in late spring to early summer. Tensiometer data indicate that net recharge from the deeper part of the vadose zone into groundwater occurs later in summer, after water table decline. The effectiveness of summer evapotranspiration in limiting groundwater recharge is reflected in water potentials decreasing to as low as -3 MPa within the upper 1.5 m of the vadose zone. Examination of the historical precipitation record further indicates that net recharge only occurs in years with above-average precipitation during winter and spring. These short intervals of net recharge also facilitate C transport into groundwater because of higher organic C concentrations in the vadose zone. Fluxes of CO2 measured at the soil surface are consistent with estimates based on season- and temperature-dependent diffusion and respiration within the vadose zone. Thus, fairly predictable seasonal variations in water table elevation, evapotranspiration, and temperature can help constrain estimates of water and carbon fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Old-growth tropical forests are responsible for a potentially large portion of the terrestrial carbon sink, although the underlying control mechanisms of that sink, has large uncertainties. The quantification of the tropical forest carbon sink is a grand challenge of measurement scale. Therefore, there is a strong emphasis on incorporating improved vegetation structure and compositional representativeness in land-surface modeling. Vegetation demography, plant competition, mechanistic mortality, disturbance cycling, and plant functional traits strongly control carbon dynamics and energy budgets of the Earth’s surface. Size and age structured scaling processes have not been represented in the widely used Community Land Model (CLM) until the recent inclusion of the Ecosystem Demography (ED) model into CLM 4.5, i.e., CLM-ED. The goal of this study was to compare how CLM-ED captured tropical carbon cycling dynamics compared to CLM and 16 years of field measurements from a central Amazonian forest. We evaluated critical carbon flux processes (Mg C ha-1 yr-1) such as net ecosystem exchange (NEE), net primary production (NPP), and autotrophic respiration (AR), and additional representations of growth and maintenance in CLM and CLM-ED. For a central Amazonian forest CLM estimated GPP from 2000-2012, with transient CO2 concentrations, to be 31.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 and was similar to field measurements, while initial evaluation of the newly developed CLM-ED estimated GPP to be substantially higher. The introduction of the size and age structure of ED to the CLM framework enables a finer granularity of state information in the canopy and new ways to represent canopy physics. Therefore alternative physics processes were compared, including those that are highly resolved at the cohort scale (i.e. plant groups) to those at the highly parameterized community scale (i.e. the plant canopy as a whole). CLM serves as the land-model component for nearly 40% of the Earth System Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The incorporation of vegetation size and age structure into CLM-ED aims to improve the representation of ecosystem processes that govern structure, flux of carbon, and potential biomass accumulation.",

            "abstract": "The vertical structure of marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds plays an important role in satellite retrievals of cloud microphysical properties such as droplet size (re) , liquid water path (LWP), and droplet number concentration (CDNC). Passive optical retrievals of LWP such as those performed by MODIS rely on cloud vertical structure assumptions to relate cloud optical thickness (τ) and re retrievals to a corresponding LWP. Typically these passive remote sensing techniques assume that clouds are vertically homogenous [Platnick et al., 2003]. However, it has been suggested that an adiabatic cloud model could potentially introduce more realistic assumptions for some MBL cloud regimes [Wood and Hartmann, 2005; Bennartz, 2007]. In reality, cloud vertical structure is often more complicated than either of these assumptions because structure can be altered by both precipitation and mixing processes. This work examines the impact of varied and realistic cloud vertical structures on retrievals requiring fixed homogeneous or adiabatic structure assumptions. To address this we use the DHARMA cloud large-eddy simulation (LES) model [Ackerman et al. 2004] and a MODIS-like satellite retrieval simulator [Zhang et al. 2012]. The LES and retrieval simulator allow for the direct comparison of retrievals to the in-situ microphysical structure of the LES cloud field. Physical properties from the LES cloud field such as the degree of adiabaticity and droplet growth lapse rate are examined and linked to the impact of retrieval biases. The retrieval comparison led to the development of a predictive theoretical framework for determining which of the LES pixels satisfied either homogeneous or adiabatic vertical structure assumptions. The theoretical model was also utilized to extend a single-layer adiabatic cloud model to an arbitrary two-layer model capable of characterizing the impact of entrainment features on cloud retrievals performed on the LES. Our results overwhelmingly demonstrate that the impact of realistic cloud vertical structure on retrievals is more complicated than either of the vertical structure assumptions currently being implemented by the remote sensing community.",

Missions that target the Earth’s deep biosphere, Mars, moons of Jupiter (including Europa), moons of Saturn (Titan and Enceladus), and small bodies such as asteroids or comets require methods that enable detection of materials for both in-situ analysis that preserve context and as a means to select high priority sample for return to Earth.\nIn situ instrumentation for biosignature detection spans a wide range of analytical and spectroscopic methods that capitalize on amino acid distribution, chirality, lipid composition, isotopic fractionation, or textures that persist in the environment. Many of the existing analytical instruments are bulk analysis methods and while highly sensitive, these require sample acquisition and sample processing. However, by combining with triaging spectroscopic methods, biosignatures can be targeted on a surface and preserve spatial context (including mineralogy, textures, and organic distribution). To provide spatially correlated chemical analysis at multiple spatial scales (meters to microns) we have employed a dual spectroscopic approach that capitalizes on high sensitivity deep UV native fluorescence detection and high specificity deep UV Raman analysis.. Recently selected as a payload on the Mars 2020 mission, SHERLOC incorporates these optical methods for potential biosignatures detection on Mars. We present data from both Earth analogs that operate as our only examples known biosignatures and meteorite samples that provide an example of abiotic organic formation, and demonstrate how provenance effects the spatial distribution and composition of organics.",

            "abstract": "Ocean carbon uptake reduces the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere and thus damps anthropogenic climate change. Ocean carbon uptake is driven by the air-sea difference in pCO2. Carbon uptake by the ocean increases pCO2SW; the rate of increase determines the evolution of the ocean sink and is modulated by ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. Many recent observational studies have used in situ data to infer changes in the ocean carbon sink; however, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the spatial and temporal structure of the long-term response to rising atmospheric CO2 and patterns associated with changes in physical climate, making detection of trends a challenge. We use results from the CESM Large Ensemble experiment to quantify the timescales and magnitude of internal variability in pCO2SW in comparison to the forced trend. Over most of the ocean and for most timescales, the forced pCO2SW trend is weaker than the trend in atmospheric pCO2 (indicating a strengthening sink), particularly in regions of upwelling or deep vertical mixing. On 10-year timeframes, the amplitude of the internal response is comparable to 10-30% of the forced response in the subtropics and 60-100% in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes. This equates to deviations from the forced response of generally < 0.4 ppmv/yr in the subtropics but up to 2 ppmv/yr in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes. On 20-year timeframes, the internal variability diminishes substantially to <10% of the forced response in the subtropics and <20% in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes. This transition from a 10 to 20 year timeframe increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the Equatorial Pacific and high-latitudes from 1 to >5. On 30-year timeframes, the internal variability is <10% of the forced response globally with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 10.",

            "abstract": "Fire severity can be defined using satellite imagery to ratio mid (~2.2 um) to near (~0.8 um) infrared reflectance values. We examined how lithology and topography affected burn severity, and how post-fire soils data could be used to ground-truth burn severity at two sites in southwestern Montana. A burned area reflectance classification (BARC), lithology, and terrain attributes were used to predict burn severity for the Millie Fire, which was triggered two years ago by lightning and burned ~4,000 ha. Burn severity showed a strong dependence on lithology: the ratio of areas with high burn severity vs. low or moderate burn severities was 2.9 for gneiss (vs. 0.3 for volcanics). The high-severity burn area for the gneiss was larger than the volcanics, despite the latter lithology covering ~270% greater area (~2,600 ha). Aspect and elevation also influenced burn severity with lower severity at higher elevations (2,600-3,000 m) and higher severity at lower elevations (1,800-2,400 m). Southern and western aspects burned more severely than northern and eastern aspects. To clarify whether post-fire soil geochemical changes might predict ground-based estimates of fire severity, a lab experiment was carried out . We expected residual enrichment of trace metal concentrations, as soil organic matter (SOM) was combusted, which we quantified as loss on ignition (LOI). To test this approach, burned and unburned soils were sampled from the ~6000 ha Beartrap 2 fire, which also burned two years. We simulated differing fire severities on unburned soil using a muffle furnace factorially (duration [5, 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes] x temperature [50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500ºC]). Consistent with expectations, unburned samples had a lower mean (±1SD) concentrations for 23 of 30 elements than field-burned samples. For example, barium concentrations ([Ba]) in unburned samples were (708±37μg/g), 16% lower than field-burned [Ba] (841±7 μg/g). Simulated burning yielded smaller [Ba] (732±9 μg/g). Of the 30 trace metals examined, barium explained the greatest fraction of variance in post-burn LOI (R2 =0.79); gallium explained slightly less variance (R2=0.67). Our results document the promise of post-burn soil geochemistry to indicate soil burn severity, which could complement vegetation-based and remotely sensed indices.",

            "abstract": "As nitrate levels in lotic systems have increased, nutrient reduction strategies have become the centerpiece of water quality standards to protect and restore stream ecosystems. While reducing anthropogenic nitrate (NO3) loads has many positive effects, we lack a fundamental understanding of how lotic systems respond to changing concentrations and no methods exist to characterize nutrient uptake behavior below ambient levels. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether nutrient reductions will meet management goals. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a chamber-based method which allows characterization of NO3 utilization along the two major uptake pathways at reduced NO3 levels. The chamber blocks flow by insertion into upper sediments but allows light in and sediment-water-air interactions to occur. At Gum Slough Springs, Florida, high-resolution in-situ sensors measured water quality while NO3 reduced from ambient levels (1.40 mg N/L) to below regulatory thresholds (ca. 0.20 mg N/L) within one week. Daytime NO3 uptake, resulting from both plant uptake and denitrification, was consistently greater than nighttime uptake, which is denitrification alone. Using this method, we compared NO3 uptake rates (UNO3) and gross primary production (GPP) across three vegetative regimes (i.e. submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), SAV with epiphytic algae, and algae alone) and related GPP estimates from the chamber to reach scale. Results showed that UNO3 and GPP were greatest in SAV, GPP was negatively correlated to [NO3] in algae, denitrification rates did not vary by vegetation type, and chamber GPP (e.g. 6-8 g O2/m2/day in SAV) was comparable to reach-scale estimates (6-12 g O2/m2/day). Our results suggest UNO3 and GPP differ by vegetation regimes, GPP scales from chamber to reach level, algal presence potentially reduces GPP, and a lack of nutrient limitation even at low [NO3]. Current work includes replicating measurements across systems as well as refining the decoupling of NO3 removal pathways using the N2:Ar approach for denitrification. Overall, this method shows promise as a tool for in-situ ecosystem-scale assessments of nutrient retention below ambient concentrations, and thus may enable future investigations focused on predicting how rivers will respond to enrichment and restoration.",

            "abstract": "Public interest in volcanic eruptions and societal relevance of volcanic hazards provide an excellent basis for successful earth science outreach. During a museum-based earth science outreach event free and open to the public, we used two new interactive experiments to illustrate the relationship between gas content, magma viscosity, and eruption style. Learning objectives for visitors are to understand: how gas drives volcanic eruptions, the differences between effusive and explosive eruption styles, viscosity’s control on gas pressure within a magma reservoir, and the role of gas pressure on eruption style. Visitors apply the scientific method by asking research questions and testing hypotheses by conducting the experiments. The demonstrations are framed with real life examples of volcanic eruptions (e.g., Mt. St. Helens eruption in 1980), providing context for the scientific concepts.\nThe first activity demonstrates the concept of fluid viscosity and how gas interacts with fluids of different viscosities. Visitors blow bubbles into water and corn syrup. The corn syrup is so viscous that bubbles are trapped, showing how a more viscous material builds up higher gas pressure. Visitors are asked which kind of magma (high or low viscosity) will produce an explosive eruption.\nTo demonstrate an explosive eruption, visitors add an Alka-Seltzer tablet to water in a snap-top film canister. The reaction rapidly produces carbon dioxide gas, increasing pressure in the canister until the lid pops off and the canister launches a few meters into the air (tinyurl.com/nzsgfoe). Increasing gas pressure in the canister is analogous to gas pressure building within a magma reservoir beneath a volcano. The lid represents high-viscosity magma that prevents degassing, causing gas pressure to reach explosive levels. This interactive activity is combined with a display of an effusive eruption: add vinegar to baking soda in a model volcano to produce a quick-flowing eruption.\nThese demonstrations were implemented in March 2014 at “Can You Dig It?”, a popular annual collaborative outreach event hosted by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida Department of Geological Sciences (>1,500 visitors). These experiments were also used to illustrate volcanic processes at the VGP Exploration Station, AGU 2013.",

To raise public awareness of air quality in the Colorado Front Range and to educate all age groups about ground-level ozone, two ozone bioindicator gardens were planted in Boulder in Spring 2014. The gardens contain ozone-sensitive plants that develop a characteristic ozone injury when exposed to high levels of ozone.

            "abstract": "Yellowstone hosts a voluminous magmatic system that produced three silicic caldera-forming eruptions over the past 2.1 My. Following the most recent of these (the Lava Creek Tuff at 639 ka), the magma system at Yellowstone underwent two episodes of intracaldera eruptions, the latest of which produced the Central Plateau Member (CPM) rhyolites. The CPM rhyolites erupted intermittently from ca. 170 ka to ca. 70 ka and can be viewed as snapshots of the magma system through time, which provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of an evolving caldera system. To constrain the nature and timescales of magmatic processes at Yellowstone we examine four CPM rhyolites that erupted from ca. 116 ka to ca. 74 ka and present a comprehensive data set that integrates (1) 238U-230Th ages, trace-elements, and Hf isotope compositions of the surfaces and interiors of single zircons, (2) bulk 238U-230Th ages and in situ Ba and Pb isotope compositions of sanidines, (3) sanidine 40Ar-39Ar ages, and (4) trace-element and isotopic compositions of the CPM glasses. Zircon 238U-230Th ages and Hf isotope data demonstrate that isotopically juvenile magmas, derived from Yellowstone basalts, were added to the Yellowstone magma reservoir over time and were fundamental to its post-caldera isotopic evolution. We use zircon Hf isotope data along with new Hf isotope data (and existing O isotope data) for the Yellowstone basalts (whole-rocks), older Yellowstone rhyolites (glasses), and local crustal sources to quantify the role of isotopically juvenile magma in the evolution of the magmatic system. Additionally, linking age, trace-element, and isotopic data from zircon and sanidine demonstrates that eruptible CPM rhyolites were generated by extracting melt and antecrystic zircon from a long-lived (>200 ky) crystal mush, while sanidine remained trapped in the crystal network. The extracted melts amalgamated and then crystallized new sanidines and rims on the antecrystic zircons that were in equilibrium with their host melt. In this model, the ages of the zircon surfaces and sanidines constrain the residence times of the eruptible magma bodies to < 9 ky. This study highlights how detailed investigations linking the age and composition of minerals hosted in rhyolites can provide information on the dynamics of magmatic processes at a variety of scales.",

Among the most important characteristics that distinguish fallers from risers are: large angles of propagation and usually lower maximum amplitudes. These characteristics make fallers more difficult to simulate numerically than risers. Recently, we have developed a new model that successfully accounts for fallers. The model proposes that fallers start as a marginally unstable mode, which requires a balance between growth and damping, attributable to the Landau damping of oblique waves in this collisionless environment. The extension of the theory to risers will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Constructive epistemic modeling is the idea that our understanding of a natural system through a scientific model is a mental construct that continually develops through learning about and from the model. Using the hierarchical Bayesian model averaging (HBMA) method [1], this study shows that segregating different uncertain model components through a BMA tree of posterior model probabilities, model prediction, within-model variance, between-model variance and total model variance serves as a learning tool [2]. First, the BMA tree of posterior model probabilities permits the comparative evaluation of the candidate propositions of each uncertain model component. Second, systemic model dissection is imperative for understanding the individual contribution of each uncertain model component to the model prediction and variance. Third, the hierarchical representation of the between-model variance facilitates the prioritization of the contribution of each uncertain model component to the overall model uncertainty. We illustrate these concepts using the groundwater modeling of a siliciclastic aquifer-fault system. The sources of uncertainty considered are from geological architecture, formation dip, boundary conditions and model parameters. The study shows that the HBMA analysis helps in advancing knowledge about the model rather than forcing the model to fit a particularly understanding or merely averaging several candidate models.\n[1] Tsai, F.

With increased focus on impacts of climate warming and economic opportunities in the Arctic due to the opening of the Northern Sea Routes, Alaska has received heightened attention in the last few years. Airborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) is a powerful tool for mineral exploration and ecological applications in remote Alaska. In the mid-80s there was an AVIRIS airborne campaign followed by a long hiatus. Summer 2014 saw a flurry of activities with airborne hyperspectral data acquisition by NASA's G-LiHT and CARVE teams, USGS spectroscopy group (with HyMap sensors) and private companies. These missions will provide valuable baseline data for research in Alaska, but may not be able to allow for multiple intra-annual or inter-annual observations. UAF's HyLab, established with a Major Research Instrumentation grant from NSF, provides this much needed local airborne hyperspectral imaging capability in the VNIR and SWIR regions using a relatively low-cost HySpex sensor.

            "abstract": "Over the last half century, the green revolution has transformed India from a famine-prone, drought-susceptible country, into the world’s third largest grain producer and one of the most intensely irrigated regions on the planet. This is in no small part due to the country's vast water resources along with an increase in tubewells and more advanced abstraction methods. While agricultural intensification has had undeniable benefits, it has, and continues to have a significant impact on water resources. Unless solutions which take into consideration the ever evolving socio-economic, hydrological and climatic conditions are found, India's agricultural future looks bleak.\nThis research examines the irrigation behaviour of farmers, using data collected during field work in the State of Uttar Pradesh within the Ganges Basin of North India. Significant differences in farmer behaviour and irrigation practices are highlighted, not only between State districts but between individual farmers. This includes the volume of irrigation water applied and the price paid, as well as differences in the yields of crops produced. Analyses of results suggest that this is due to a number of factors, particularly the source of irrigation water. Study areas which had access to cheaper, but crucially less reliable, canal water were found to invest in more efficient water saving technologies in order to reduce the overall cost of irrigation during periods where less expensive canal water is not available. As a result, overall water use and irrigation cost is lower and yields are higher despite very similar climatic conditions. While cheap canal water is not an option for all farmers, the results show that the introduction of more efficient water saving technologies, despite the significant capital expenditure is a viable option for many farmers and costs can be recovered in a relatively short space of time. In addition, the reduction of declining water levels mean that water is abstracted from a shallower depths, resulting in an extra cost saving.\nThe impacts and practicalities of introducing more water efficient technologies are discussed and their potential impact on water resources and farmer livelihoods, pointing the way to a realistic and more sustainable balance between agriculture and sustainable water resources in the future.

All Level-1b and Level-2+ products created by ABI will be geometrically interpolated to a Fixed Grid; a set of static pixel locations centered on the sub-satellite point. The Fixed Grid represents a new standard in products created by the GOES series of satellites and will aid users by providing continuity in the locations of geographic features throughout mission life. However, detector-level anomalies will be impacted by the resampling process in a variety of ways. Depending on the nature of the anomaly, the proximity of the detector sample to the pixel centers, and the underlying scene phenomenology, the resampling process has the potential to both amplify and mitigate system anomalies. This work will introduce the resampling process and the Fixed Grid, as well as present a case study characterizing the radiometric impacts of detector anomalies to L1b products.",

            "abstract": "As the National Research Council noted in its 2012 report on discipline-based education research (DBER) in undergraduate science and engineering, in order to advance DBER as a field of inquiry, “a robust infrastructure is required to recognize and support [DBER] within professional societies.” One way to develop such an infrastructure around geoscience education research is to create a community of practice within the broader geoscience education community. In recent years, the members of the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) have created two divisions to support the geoscience education needs of specific subpopulations of the geoscience community: the 2YC division, focusing on community college issues, and TED, focusing on teacher education. This year marks the first year of a new division within the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) focused on geoscience education research. The Geoscience Education Research division (GER) is committed to the promotion of high quality, scholarly research in geoscience education that improves teaching and learning in K-12, higher education, and informal learning environments. High quality DBER in geoscience requires the ability to connect current theories of teaching and learning with deep content-specific conceptual understanding. A community of practice like NAGT GER, has the potential to improve the quality of scholarly efforts in geoscience education by providing a forum for improving the collective knowledge and expertise of the geoscience education research community. Current division initiatives and efforts will be highlighted and time for dialogue on future directions will be included.",

We explore the utility of the Community Ice Code (CICE) model, designed for fully coupled global climate models. CICE was run in standalone mode, with an integrated module that includes ice salinity as a prognostic variable (Turner et al., doi:10.1002/jgrc.20171).\nWe examine performance of the CICE salinity module by hindcasting interannual variability in the seasonal cycle of first-year ice salinity and temperature. Landfast ice, monitored at Barrow, Alaska since 1999 (SIZONet.org), provides a suitable test case and reference. The model is forced with 6-hr weather data from the National Climate Data Center, except for precipitation and humidity provided by the NCEP reanalysis model. Simulations were run for the period 1948-2013, with a focus on 1999 to 2013 when observation data are available.\nBased on validation with measured ice and snow thicknesses, a non-zero ocean-to-ice heat flux has to be specified to reproduce the full seasonal cycle. The model captures the broad seasonal trends of key ice properties and thickness, especially during the growth season. During melt, significant deviations between observations and model output for ice temperature and salinity are observed, in particular near the ice surface where meltwater flushing is only partially captured by the CICE mushy-layer salinity module. With the exception of two years, the model captures interannual variability of ice thickness and bulk ice salinity well.\nFurther work is required to improve the accuracy of the full seasonal range of modeled salinity variations, especially during the melt season when processes at the ice interface are not well reproduced by the model. However, in conjunction with local validation data, CICE may serve as a tool to assess regional variations in key ice properties on interannual to decadal time scales.",

However, to date, our understanding of broad-scale (e.g. global) patterns of OM composition and soil minerals at depth has been limited. Here, I examine global scale patterns of C and N with depth up to 100 cm using prior published studies and a global-scale pedon C and N content data set made available through the International Soil Carbon Network (ISCN). Questions addressed include: (1) How do C and N soil profile depth trends vary by soil type and biogeoclimatically, and (2) What might this tell us about underlying mechanisms controlling C and N abundance and OM composition in soil ? I draw heavily on prior studies in evaluating the current state of knowledge and uncertainty in terms of these trends. Underlying possible mechanisms of declining C to N ratio are evaluated based on a range of soil litter, laboratory incubation and mineral sorption experiments. The extent to which microorganisms may influence soil C and N depth patterns is further evaluated. The study is part of broader effort through the North American Carbon Program to better understand global-scale mechanisms for soil carbon accumulation and stabilization in the subsoil.",

Metadata brokering, linked data, and other mechanisms allow users to discover scientific data of interes across growing volumes of heterogeneous content. Matching this complex content with existing discovery technologies, people looking for scientific data are presented with an ever-growing array of features to sort, filter, subset, and scan through search returns to help them find what they are looking for. This paper examines the applicability of available technologies in connecting searchers with the data of interest. What metrics can be used to track success given shifting baselines of content and technology? How well do existing technologies map to steps in user search patterns?\nTaking a user-driven development approach, the team behind the Arctic Data Explorer interdisciplinary data discovery application invested heavily in usability testing and user search behavior analysis. Building on earlier library community search behavior work, models were developed to better define the diverse set of thought processes and steps users took to find data of interest, here called 'search pathways'. This research builds a deeper understanding of the user community that seeks to reuse scientific data. This approach ensures that development decisions are driven by clearly articulated user needs instead of ad hoc technology trends. Initial results from this research will be presented along with lessons learned for other discovery platform development and future directions for informatics research into search pathways.",

            "abstract": "The grasslands of the U.S. Great Plains vary greatly year-to-year in aboveground productivity due in large part to rainfall patterns. The timing and magnitude of productivity is further influenced by the composition of plants that are C3 (cool season) or C4 (warm season) photosynthetic types. This region is forecasted to undergo seasonal shifts in precipitation, with large rain events separated by longer dry intervals, and much uncertainty remains about the impact that this will have on carbon cycling in these grasslands. Furthermore, past observations may be inadequate for estimating how arid and semi-arid grasslands will respond to more extreme precipitation patterns. Our study at Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) contrasts above and belowground fluxes of water and CO2 between a C3 dominated, reclaimed grassland and a nearby C4 dominated, native tallgrass prairie. Each grassland is instrumented with an eddy covariance tower, soil moisture and temperature arrays, and soil gas wells measuring soil CO2 concentrations at 5, 10, and 15 cm depths. Leaf area index (LAI) and biomass were obtained through destructive sampling about every 2 weeks throughout the growing season. Measurements of water and carbon cycling include the growing seasons for 2011-2014, with special focus on the late growing season and highly saturated conditions following the extreme precipitation events of September 2013. Cumulative rainfall measurements at the study sites for the period September 9-15, 2013 were approximately 200mm, and soil moisture increased from 15% to over 50% (completely saturated) during the same period. Preliminary results in the C3 dominated grassland during this event showed a rapid increase in the CO2 concentration gradient, with the soil CO2 concentration at the 15cm depth increasing from 1339 ppm to 4246 ppm in less than 1 hour. Yet increasing soil water content caused a decrease in diffusion of CO2, with efflux going from 0.1 mgC/m2/hr to zero during the same period. LAI and biomass along with NEE measurements indicate that aboveground productivity increased in the C3 dominated grassland in October 2013, while the C4 dominated tallgrass prairie did not increase production at this time.",

            "abstract": "The current rapid reduction of sea ice in the Arctic has motivated numerous studies to look at how sea ice declines during times of climate warming and its impact on marine ecosystems. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 is the last interglacial prior to the Holocene and has been characterized as having higher summer air temperatures and higher sea level compared to today. However, there is a scarcity of data for sea ice extent during MIS 5. This presents an opportunity to reconstruct sea ice during a previous warming that may be used as an analogue for future change. We aim to provide insight into how sea ice changed throughout MIS 5 and how this change impacted primary productivity at the Umnak Plateau in the southeastern Bering Sea. This region is not currently covered by sea ice at all; however, low-resolution work reveals that sea ice did reach the study area during glacial intervals.\nThis study uses high-resolution (500 year) bulk geochemistry, diatom taxonomy, and grain size analysis of marine sediments from the Umnak Plateau as proxies for primary production and sea ice conditions during MIS 5. Nitrogen isotopic measurements of marine sediments are a valuable recorder of nitrate utilization by primary producers. Diatom taxonomy gives corresponding ecological affinities, which are relatable to sea ice coverage, productivity, and sea surface temperatures. Grain size analyses from previous studies have shown clay- and silt-sized biogenic content with well-preserved diatom valves to be associated with interglacials and larger silt to sand-size siliclastic particles with fragmented diatom valves to be associated with glacials. In this study, the silt fraction appears to be constant while the clay fraction follows the oxygen isotope record from Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005, increasing during glacial intervals and stadials. This apparent contradiction with earlier work warrants further investigation.",

            "abstract": "While the North Polar Layered Deposits (NPLD) have long been considered Mars’ best climate record, only recently have some of the processes governing the evolution of the NPLD to their current form been discovered and even directly observed. MOC revealed outcrops of an interbedded ice and dark-sand “basal unit” (BU) below steep NPLD scarps. Some bright markings on the BU were suggested to be talus deposits of mass-wasted NPLD ice, caused by undercutting via removal of easily erodible BU sand. In previous work with HiRISE images that confirmed the origin of these deposits, we: detailed their meter-scale morphology, constituent features, and variability; identified fractures of BU ice layers and NPLD scarps as additional mass-wasting facilitators; and, based on inter- and inter-annual monitoring, discovered that new deposits appear over time, thereby establishing mass wasting (of both BU and NPLD ice) as a currently active process.\nHere, we advance from qualitative descriptions of new, active processes to quantification of the rates at which they are occurring. From ~4 years of HiRISE observations, we cataloged the location, volume, source, and timing constraints of >160 landslide events along ~ 20 km of BU-NPLD scarp. Average rates are ~44 events/yr and ~2000 m3/yr, although 7 large events account for ~3/4 of the volume; this is a very geologically dynamic environment. BU events are more frequent and smaller than NPLD events, reflecting the relative thickness of ice source deposits but also perhaps differing proportions of two causal mechanisms: sand-removal undercutting and thermal-stress induced expansion, contraction, and fracturing. BU events prefer summer over spring; NPLD events strongly prefer fall-winter over spring-summer. We compare this observational data with 1) thermal stress models of the ice scarp to assess consistency in timing of activity, and 2) sublimation models of the ice scarp to assess the relative contributions to scarp retreat - our preliminary mass-wasting estimate is ~2.5 mm/yr. The value in developing such rate estimates is the potential to consider time scales in exploring aspects of large-scale north polar landscape evolution (e.g., retreating cap edges, the growth of proto-Chasma Boreale, etc.) and the release of water to the atmosphere.",

Precipitation affects these sectors as concerns about precipitation timing and intensity can affect the agricultural growing season, runoff, and subsequent water quality. Here, we examine precipitation projections for mid-century (2041-2065) within the Great Lakes basin (GLB) and two sub-regions using three climate model ensembles of varying resolutions to constrain and compare associated precipitation uncertainties. These include: 1. atmosphere-ocean models from the CMIP5 global simulations with the RCP 8.5 scenario (12 members, resolution ranging from ~1 to ~3 degrees), 2. dynamically downscaled regional climate models from NARCCAP with the SRES A2 scenario (4 members at ~0.5 degree resolution (50 km)), and 3. high resolution (~0.25 degree resolution (25 km)) regional climate model simulations with the RCP 8.5 scenario (RegCM (hereafter RCM3(HiRes)), 2 members). For the entire GLB, all three ensembles captured the intensity of historical events well, but with a bias in the high intensity precipitation events as compared to observed intensity, with fewer overprediction events by the NARCCAP and RCM3(HiRes) ensembles. Daily probability density functions from three model ensembles reveal consistent increases in high precipitation event probabilities for all seasons, even after accounting for wet model biases during the observation period (1980-1999). Comparing all three ensembles to the historical period for the GLB, both CMIP5 and NARCCAP ensembles capture the annual seasonal cycle with a wet bias in the winter and spring, while the RCM3(HiRes) ensemble shows a dry bias for all seasons except winter. For the Lake Michigan and Western Lake Erie basin sub-regions, the spring and winter biases remain present across ensembles, however the RCM3(HiRes) summer dry bias is reduced. Overall, the three climate model ensembles show consensus for an increase in precipitation intensity as well as increased seasonal spring and winter precipitation across the GLB.",

Our study focuses on Bangladesh, which is particularly vulnerable to changes in extremes due to both the large population at risk, as well as geographical characteristics such as the low-rising slope of the country through which the outflow of the combined catchments of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers (GBM, ~1.75 million km2) is channeled.\nTime series of daily discharge and water level data for the past 100 years were analyzed with respect to trends in frequency, magnitude and duration, focusing on rare but particularly high-risk events using extreme-value theory. Mortality data is available for a five-year period (2003-2007), with a distributed lag non-linear model used to examine possible connections between extreme water levels and mortality.\nThen, using output from the Community Climate System Model CCSM4, projections were made regarding future flooding due to changes in precipitation intensity and frequency, while also accounting for the backwater effect of sea-level rise. For this, the upper catchment precipitation as well as monthly mean thermosteric sea-level rise at the river mouth outflow were taken from the four CCSM4 1° 20th Century ensemble members as well as from six CCSM4 1° ensemble members for the RCP scenarios RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5.\nResults show that while e.g. the mean water level did not significantly rise during the past 100 years, a change in extreme water levels can be detected. In addition, annual minimum water levels have decreased, which is of particular importance as there is a significant connection to an increase in mortality for low water levels. While mortality does not seem to increase significantly due to extreme floods, our results indicate that return levels projected for the future shift progressively, with the effect being strongest for RCP 8.5. Further measures to strengthen the resilience of the exposed population are therefore required to ensure that climate change effects do not overwhelm the population’s coping capacities.",

            "abstract": "As part of the “Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climate and Environmental Change” (SPRUCE) experiment, we made initial measurements of sulfur speciation in peat. These observations represent a “time-zero” relative to the intended soil warming experiment which begins in 2015. Total sulfur and sulfur speciation were measured in peat cores (solid phase) from nine plots (hollows and hummocks) to a depth of 2 m. Peat samples were packed under nitrogen and frozen in the field immediately after collection. All subsequent sample storage, handling, and processing were conducted under inert gas. Sulfur speciation was measured using bulk sulfur 1s X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the SXRMB instrument at the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon, SK, Canada and at the 9-BM instrument, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, IL, USA. Total sulfur concentrations ranged from 968 to 4077 mg sulfur / kg dry peat. Sulfur content increased with depth from 2 g sulfur / m2 in the 0-10 cm increment to a maximum value of 38 g sulfur / m2 in the 50-60 cm increment. These sulfur loadings produced high quality XANES spectra. The nine cores exhibited reproducible trends with depth in both total sulfur and specific sulfur species; however, variability in sulfur speciation was greatest in the top 40 cm. All sulfur detected within the peat solids was in an organic form. The most abundant sulfur species group was composed of organic mono-sulfide and thiol forms, representing approximately half of the total sulfur at all depths. Sulfonate and ester-sulfate species were 10-15 mol% of sulfur and exhibited low variability with depth.  A subsurface maximum in organic di-sulfide was observed in the 20-30 cm depth increment, which is the transition zone between transiently oxidized acrotelm and permanently saturated anaerobic catotelm. Quantification of major sulfur pools is important for the SPRUCE experiment as they are likely to be indicators of changes in the oxidation-reduction (redox) status, and mercury methylation potential, of the peat in response to warming and enhanced carbon dioxide.",

            "abstract": "In order to improve the representation of the land surface and subsurface properties and their associated feedbacks with climate forcings, climate change, and drivers in Earth System Models (ESMs), detailed observations need to be made at climatically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Pan-Arctic spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation present major challenges to the current generation of ESMs. To enable highly spatially resolved and high temporal frequency measurements for the independent validation of modeled energy and greenhouse gas surface fluxes at core to intermediate scales, we have developed, tested, and deployed an automated observational platform, the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE)-Arctic Tram. The NGEE-Arctic Tram, installed on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) near Barrow, AK in mid May 2014, consists of 65 meters of elevated track and a fully automated cart carrying a suite of radiation and remote sensing instrumentation. The tram transect is located within the NGEE eddy covariance tower footprint to help better understand the relative contribution of different landforms (e.g. low center vs high center polygonal tundra and associated vegetation) to the overall energy budget of the footprint. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), soil moisture, and soil temperature sensors are acquired autonomously and co-located with the tram to link subsurface properties with surface observations. To complement the high frequency and fine spatial resolution of the tram, during the summer field seasons of 2013 and 2014 a portable version of the NGEE-Arctic Tram (also know as the portable energy pole or PEP); was used to characterize surface albedo, NDVI, surface temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) across two ~500 m BEO transects co-located with subsurface ERT and ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements. In addition, a ~ 3 Km transect across three drained thaw-lake basins (DTLB) of different climate-change relevant ages (from 50 years to more than 3000 years old) was measured with PEP. Soil surface CO2 and CH4 flux measurements were co-located with tram and PEP measurements. These data will enhance our understanding of the spatial distribution of climate forcing variables across the Arctic landscape through validation of Earth system models.",

Closest approach is expected to occur at 18:30 UT on the 19th October. This provides an opportunity for a ``free’’ flyby of a different type of comet than those investigated by spacecraft so far, including comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko currently under scrutiny by the Rosetta spacecraft. At the same time, the passage of the comet through Martian space will create the opportunity to study the reaction of the planet’s upper atmosphere to a known natural perturbation. The flip-side of the coin is the risk to Mars-orbiting assets, both existing (NASA’s Mars Odyssey & Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA’s Mars Express) and in transit (NASA’s MAVEN and ISRO’s Mangalyaan) by high-speed cometary dust potentially impacting spacecraft surfaces. Much work has already gone into assessing this hazard and devising mitigating measures in the precious little warning time given to characterise this object until Mars encounter.\nIn this presentation, we will provide an overview of how the meteoroid stream and comet coma dust impact models evolved since the comet’s discovery and discuss lessons learned should similar circumstances arise in the future.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of physiological limitations to tree establishment at alpine treeline form the basis for predicting how this climate-driven boundary will respond to climate shifts. Most research on this topic has focused on limitations related to carbon balance and growth of trees. Carbon balance could limit survival and establishment primarily through slow-acting, chronic means. We asked whether tree survival and thus establishment patterns reflect control by chronic effects in comparison to acute, threshold responses, such as survival of frost events. Seedling survivorship patterns were compared to thresholds in freezing (temperature causing leaf freezing, or freezing point, FP; and physiological response to freezing) and water status (turgor loss point, TLP; and related physiological adjustments). Subject seedlings were from forest, treeline, and alpine sites in the Alpine Treeline Warming Experiment in Colorado, and included limber and lodgepole pine (a low-elevation species), and Engelmann Spruce. Preliminary results show survival increases with seedling age, but the only corresponding increase in stress acclimation was photosynthetic resistance to freezing and TLP, not FP. Differences in survivorship among the species were not consistent with variation in FP but they generally agreed with variation in photosynthetic resistance to deep freezing and to early-season drought avoidance. Mortality of limber pine increased 35% when minimum temperatures decreased below -9C, which compares with FPs of >-8.6C, and about 1/3 of its mortality occurred during cold/wet events, particularly in the alpine. The other major correlate of mortality is midsummer drying events, as previously reported. Also in limber pine, the TLP for year-old seedlings (-2.5 MPa) corresponded with seasonal-drought mortality. In summary, we show several examples of correspondence in physiological thresholds to mortality events within a species, although the relationships are not strong. Across species, photosynthetic resistance to freezing and early-season drought avoidance related well to mortality patterns. These results are generally more supportive of the role of chronic rather than acute climate effects in broad patterns of tree seedling establishment at treeline.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic results from a 150m thick stack of 15.2 my old lava flows in the Sheep Creek Range (north central Nevada; 40.7N, 243.2E) show that distinctive aspects of the reversing geomagnetic field can recur after 1.5 million years. The Sheep Creek lavas preserve a partial record of what is likely the C5Br-C5Bn geomagnetic reversal. That event occurred 1.5 million years and five polarity switches after reversal (C5Cr-C5Cn) recorded in great detail at Steens Mountain in SE Oregon. During both transitions, the VGP made repeat visits to low latitude positions in South America and near Africa although in different order. This behavior implies a control that varies over a timescale much longer that associated with flow in the outer core (~60 yrs), presumably lateral variations in lower mantle temperature or topography on the core-mantle boundary. Furthermore, the field in both reversals moved from clearly transitional to normal-polarity-like (i.e., down and north) directions before “rebounding” to intermediate directions. It has been suggested recently (Valet et al., Nature 2012) that this kind of behavior (i.e., directional change in the form of precursor- main polarity switch-rebound) may be a systematic aspect of transitional field behavior, a suggestion reinforced by these new observations.\nThe distinctive, two component magnetization of a particular lava flow in the Sheep Creek section has been interpreted by Bogue and Glen (GRL, 2010) as evidence of directional change (~1 deg/week) orders of magnitude faster than normal secular variation. If the field was strong at the end of the directional change, then a large change in the local geomagnetic field vector is implied by the directional data for any initial field strength. Preliminary paleointensity experiments aimed at resolving this aspect of the record are in progress.",

We intend for these slide sets to help Astronomy 101 instructors include new developments (discoveries not yet in their textbooks) into the broader context of the course.\nIn a similar effort to keep the astronomy classroom apprised of the fast moving field of planetary science, the Division of Planetary Sciences (DPS) has developed the Discovery slide sets, which are 3-slide presentations that can be incorporated into college lectures. The slide sets are targeted at the Introductory Astronomy undergraduate level. Each slide set consists of three slides which cover a description of the discovery, a discussion of the underlying science, and a presentation of the big picture implications of the discovery, with a fourth slide includes links to associated press releases, images, and primary sources. Topics span all subdisciplines of planetary science, and sets are available in Farsi and Spanish.

We used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to characterize SOM in soils exposed to litter-input exclusion or addition for 20 years, and subsequently incubated for more than a year. Our aim was to describe shifts in SOM content and chemical composition due to the input manipulation and degree of decomposition, particularly in the light (i.e., free particulate, younger) versus the heavy (mineral-adsorbed, older) fractions of SOM, and to link these shifts to carbon mineralization rates.\nThe soils were collected from a deciduous hardwood forest in Meadville, PA, one of the Detritus and Input Removal Treatment (DIRT) sites. They were subjected to either litter and root exclusion (NI), double litter (DL), or ambient inputs (CO) for 20 years and subsequently incubated at 35oC for 525 days. Soils from the beginning and end of the incubation were divided into light and heavy fractions using 1.8 g cm-3 sodium polytungstate. Bulk CO soils and heavy fractions of NI, DL, and CO soil were analyzed with FTICR-MS, while light and heavy fractions were analyzed with FTIR.\nTwenty years of input exclusion decreased the mineralization rate, the total carbon respired, and total carbon content, though litter addition had no significant effect (NI < CO = DL). The FTICR-MS and FTIR data reveal substantial differences in SOM chemistry among DIRT treatments, fractions, and before and after incubation. CO contained several classes of compounds, including alcohols and phenols, not detected in either DL or NI soils, and all samples showed an enrichment in aromatics between the light and heavy fractions. The heavy fraction DL soils were proportionally enriched in lipids compared to NI and CO soils, and these lipids were preferentially mineralized during incubation. Heavy fraction CO and NI soils were similar initially, though CO soil lost primarily lipids, while NI soil lost unsaturated hydrocarbons and proteins. These results indicate the complex interrelationships between litter inputs and soil carbon content, chemistry, and SOM decomposition.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed hourly temperature records over 30 years for 486 snow telemetry (SNOTEL) stations at the highest elevations in 13 states across the western USA. Trends determined using robust linear modeling (resilient to outliers) across the region are 0.88 +/- 0.09 C/decade, which is about three times the magnitude of the regional warming trend and six times the trend in global mean temperatures. Temperature trends across SNOTEL sites are not significantly correlated with elevation (r^2 = 0.03). Trends at most sites are strongest in fall and winter, and weakest in spring and summer. The much faster warming at very snowy sites in the western USA relative to the global mean might be related to “alpine amplification” through snow-albedo feedback. To evaluate this hypothesis we analyzed trends in the number of days with significant snow cover at the same 486 sites for which temperature trends were obtained. High-elevation warming was most rapid in Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Colorado, where trends at 23 sites exceeded 1.25 C/decade. These sites also showed strong trends toward fewer days with snow cover of more than 5 days per decade. Increasing dust deposition has been documented on mountain snowpack in that region, probably contributing to shorter snow seasons and warmer temperatures. Warming trends are typically weakest in the Pacific Northwest, northern Utah and southwest Wyoming where many stations have warmed less than 0.5 C/decade. Many of these sites have significantly more days with significant snow cover which may slow warming. Trends in both temperature and snow-covered days elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains are intermediate. Rapid warming trends at the snowiest sites in the western USA have important implications for projections of water supply in the region in coming decades.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami modeling capability had been rapidly developing even before the watershed event of the 2004 Sumatra tsunami. During 1990-2000, the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, the tsunami scientific community took on the difficult task of developing the modeling capability that would provide accuracy needed for long-term tsunami forecast — tsunami hazard maps. After exhaustive field, laboratory and modeling efforts by the international scientific community, the modeling capability has been achieved with accuracy deemed sufficient for operational use. Several real-time model forecast tools started to be used at TWCs in the US and Japan. In parallel, the observational component of tsunami warning systems had been improving, including updated existing seismic and coastal sea-level stations array. New early detection and measurement system (DART) has been developed specifically for tsunami forecast applications.\nThe 2004 Sumatra tsunami has triggered the efforts of intensive implementation of science results into operational tsunami warning capabilities. At present, several tsunami forecast systems, based on various modeling and detection capabilities, are operational. Since 2004, over 40 tsunamis, including the 2011 Japanese tsunami, provided real-time tests for the tsunami forecast system capabilities. Preliminary assessment of tsunami forecast performance will be presented based on the analysis of the U.S. operational tsunami inundation forecast. Assessing forecast performance is important to evaluate the needs for improvement and further research. Baseline of the tsunami forecast skills has now been established and will be presented based on the data from the tsunamis during the decade. Future improvements and future challenges will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Observations acquired in orbit by the Mars Surveyor spacecraft require that the average Mars crustal rock be capable of acquiring magnetization intensities that greatly exceed those common on Earth. The Mars crust is at least 20 times more intensely magnetized, on average, than Earth's crust. The Mars crust formed by crustal spreading in the presence of a reversing dynamo, a continuous process that is capable of producing uniform volume magnetizations over global scale distances. No other proposed mechanism can match the efficiency of plate tectonics in this regard. We apply a novel downward continuation method to magnetic survey data acquired from orbit and show that at ever greater spatial resolution, the hallmarks of plate tectonics (magnetic lineations, transform faults) are evident in the magnetic imprint. Where catastrophic volcanic flows have buried the crust at great depth (volcanic edifices and the northern lowlands) the primordal magnetic imprint has been effectively erased. This indicates that the effective magnetic carrier in the crust is confined to a layer no more than a few km thick and that magnetization intensities of order ~100 A/m exist throughout the magnetized crust. The average Mars crustal rock must therefore be a rock that acquires impressive magnetization intensity cooling under conditions prevalent in the Mars crust some 4 billion years ago, during the dynamo age.",

            "abstract": "The Continuously Operating Caribbean Observational Network (COCONet) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded infrastructure project that stretches across the circum-Caribbean to include Central America and the northern portions of South America. Its objective is to develop a large-scale network of geodetic and atmospheric infrastructure to support a broad range of geoscience and atmospheric investigations and enable research on process-oriented science with direct relevance to geo-hazards. The network includes over 60 new and refurbished continuously operating Global Positioning System (GPS) and surface meterology stations. It will also include data from at least 60 existing stations that are being operated by one of our more than 40 regional partners. As COCONet approaches the completion of its build-out phase, it is appropriate to evaluate the activities associated with the project that facilitate capacity building. These activities include three workshops to solicit feedback from regional partners regarding science objectives, station location, and long-term network operation. COCONet graduate research fellowships have been used to support nine students, with seven from countries within the COCONet footprint. The establishment of three regional data and archive centers to foster access to data and promote free and open data standards. Lastly, two Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) workshops on topics that are central to the main goals of COCONet were also organized to engage early career scientists who are interested in working on topics that are directly relevant to the region. Perhaps the most significant effort on expanding capacity in the region is the recent deployment of a station in Camaguey, Cuba with full support from both the U.S. and Cuban governments. This presentation summarizes the activities of the COCONet project to enhance and support both the human resource development and technical capabilities within the region.",

            "abstract": "North Pond, a sediment deposit ringed by basalt outcrops just west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, remains a site of intense study of the subseafloor biosphere. During IODP Expedition 336, core samples of sediment and basalt were drilled and permanent CORK observatories were installed in the basalt crust. Heterotrophic enrichments were started aboard ship and multiple aerobic, heterotrophic bacterial isolates were obtained from two sediment horizons. Isolate identities were compared to sequences from drilling fluid and surrounding sediment to establish the likelihood of their sedimentary source. Three isolates currently in pure culture are from site U1382B and include an Arthrobacter species from 4 meters below seafloor (mbsf) as well as a Paracoccus and Pseudomonas species from 70 mbsf. All isolates grow at tested temperatures of 4 to 37°C. Only the Arthrobacter species grows at 42°C and no isolates grew at 50°C. The presence of aerobic microorganisms at these depths is consistent with previously published oxygen profiles of site U1382B where O2 is present in low amounts (10 to 20μm) at both 4 mbsf (originating from overlying seawater) and 70 mbsf (originating from subseafloor aquifer leaching into deep sediment), yet substantial enough to support aerobic heterotrophy. Despite similar oxygen concentrations, two key differences between these depths are the origin and quality of organic matter and the surrounding lithology. Section 1H4 from site U1382B, where the Arthrobacter species was isolated, consists primarily of a nanofossil ooze. Section 8H6 (~70 mbsf) is much more clay-rich. Previous explorations of microbial heterotrophy in North Pond sediments using 14C-acetate have suggested that this metabolism may be linked to particular lithologies. A 2011 study noted higher rates of potential aerobic heterotrophy in sandy and clay-rich layers compared to nannofossil ooze layers. Since isolates are from different depths, ages and lithologies they can be used to examine the potential fitness of an indigenous organism to it’s surrounding environment, by comparatively studying the shallow and deep isolates in each others habitats.",

However, the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) and its predecessors CCSM4 and CCSM3 show uncommon sensitivity to the shortwave cloud feedback in the storm tracks rather than the tropics. The storm track feedback is coupled to aspects of the meridional overturning circulation in both CESM and its predecessors, so these effects are somehow linked but the connection is poorly understood. In order to further explore the connection between climate sensitivity and circulation in CESM, an ensemble is being conducted using a slab ocean, perturbed atmospheric convection parameters, and the spectral element dycore. The ensemble is controlled by the Multiple Ensemble Control System (MECS), which stochastically samples the uncertainty in convection parameters using very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) to converge on an approximation of the posterior probability distribution of uncertain parameters.",

            "abstract": "Plants typically expend a significant portion of their available carbon for nitrogen (N) acquisition, especially through root exudation in N-limited soils; this is the amount of carbon that would otherwise go to growth in the presence of ample N. Most global terrestrial biogeochemistry models (TBMs) do not consider the carbon cost for N acquisition. In order to evaluate the carbon–nitrogen trade process and improve the carbon­–nitrogen dynamics in TBMs, this study integrates a cutting-edge global plant nitrogen model—Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) version 2.0 (FUN2.0) into the Community Land Model 4.0. The coupled model (i.e., CLM4CN-FUN2.0) is tested at local and global scales. Generally, plant N acquisition is dynamically simulated, and the carbon cost for N acquisition is estimated by the coupled model. Sensitivity tests indicate that the low soil N uptakes of the coupled model are associated with the low soil mineral N amount represented by CLM4CN. According to the observational evidence, the retranslocated N pool in CLM4CN needs to be combined with other non-structural N pools. These deficiencies in the model open new possibilities for improving TBMs, which is widely used in global climate change studies.",

            "abstract": "Hundreds of thousands of symmetrical, vertical, bullet-shaped cavities known as bellholes are present in the ceilings of caves restricted to the tropical Americas. Most have circular diameters (rarely influenced by joints or bedding) of at least 30 cm, and may be several meters in height. They are often paired with bellbasins (shallow depressions located vertically beneath them that contain guano produced by bats). Members of the species Artibeus jamaicensis (Jamaican Fruit Bat) are almost exclusive users of these roosts. Brown streaks flowing down the sides of the bellholes and centimeters-thick rinds of the basins below are largely apatite minerals produced by the reaction of the host limestone with phosphoric acids in the guano.\nMany bellholes have developed in speleothem in the cave ceilings, disproving early theories that they are the result of solution by phreatic currents in flooded caves. A. jamaicensis roosts singly or in harem groups of 2-14 that commonly cluster in the bellholes and it is likely that these social habits of this species focus corrosion resulting from the transfer of feces to rock (producing altered rock then removed by claws) to create discretely-spaced upward-growing cavities. Fossil evidence from Jamaica supports an arrival there from the mainland in the past 12,000 years, suggesting bellholes and bellbasins are geologically recent features in the Caribbean islands.\nTheir locations (not all cave passages have bellholes) can provide information on the hydrological history or microclimate of a cave, due to the absence of both bellholes and bats in some specific situations, e.g. where physical barriers exist such as sumps, small airspaces above streams or through rock collapses, or with increasing distance from an entrance.\nSmaller circular, increasingly-indented ceiling cavities demonstrate a sequence of bellhole development. Small (23 cm diameter, 9 cm high), circular, streaked cavities in a limestone drainage tunnel constructed in 1927 in Puerto Rico suggest that a 30 cm diameter, 50 cm high bellhole could develop in fewer than 900 years. The numbers of bellholes and bellbasins suggest they may be an important post-formational erosional process in tropical caves, e.g. 4.8 linear cm of ceiling rock has been eroded just from the bellholes of only the first 600 m of a single cave in Puerto Rico.",

            "abstract": "Compared to electronic and photonic transports, heat transport is less well understood for many materials. At high temperature, thermal conductivity often displays a saturated behavior deviating from the well-known 1/T scaling. The understanding relies on a minimal mean free path phenomenology, additionally implemented to phonon gas model and often used for practical investigations. Unfortunately, a validity check of this minimal mean free path phenomenology against the underlying microscopic behavior is missing. In this work, we investigate lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 perovskite within the framework of phonon gas model. Such study is possible due to a recent theoretical advance – a hybrid approach of first principle molecular dynamics fused with lattice dynamics. MgSiO3 perovskite, the most abundant component of Earth minerals existing in the Earth lower mantle, provides an excellent test bed for studying thermal conduction under high temperature conditions. Surprisingly, the calculated phonon mean free paths do not have the prescribed minima even at extremely high temperature, and neither does the lattice thermal conductivity. The obtained lattice thermal conductivity is in good agreement with the measured values from ambient pressure to lower mantle pressures at room temperature and obeys the typical linear dependence on pressure as revealed by experiments.\nResearch supported by NSF/EAR and Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

            "abstract": "ICESat-2 is NASA’s next generation spaceborne laser altimeter, which aims to follow in the footsteps of ICESat. A major difference between this and the previous ICESat mission is the utilization of a photon counting lidar. Such systems are relatively new, and their ability to produce vegetation measurements remains largely unexplored. This study focuses on development and testing of an automated processing algorithm for high altitude photon counting lidar data, utilizing Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) and mATLAS data. mATLAS data are simulated data generated utilizing previously collected MABEL data. Conditions present during MABEL data collection are typically static while simulating mATLAS data enables varied noise levels, allowing us to test algorithm robustness. Specific goals of this algorithm include: (1) reduction of noise within the data; (2) delineation of top of canopy (TOC) and ground surfaces; (3) classification of photon returns (e.g. noise, TOC, ground, within canopy); and (4) calculation of above ground level (AGL) heights for signal photons not classified as ground. Algorithm accuracy assessment is performed using spatially coincident MABEL and Goddard’s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Airborne Imager (G-LiHT) data. Our algorithm processes data utilizing an overlapping moving window approach, ancillary datasets, median filters, pseudo-waveforms, and spline fitting techniques. Early performance on MABEL data shows lower overall RMSE for ground than TOC (3.26 and 9.58, respectively), and identified high TOC commission error rates in open areas (i.e. areas with little or no vegetation). These TOC commission errors were responsible for increased ground omission errors. After adjusting algorithm parameters, visual assessments of subsequent tests suggest reductions in open area TOC commission and ground omission rates. Overall, ground identification performed well in areas with dense canopy cover. Similar results were observed when processing mATLAS data. A notable exception is data exhibiting weak beam strength conditions, causing signal to become more difficult to identify. Future work will focus on completion of a formal accuracy assessment for mATLAS processing results, and fine-tuning algorithm parameters to deal with varied topographic relief.",

            "abstract": "Large regions of Africa burn on an annual basis. These fires damage vegetation, change surface albedo and modify the hydrologic cycle. Quantifying the magnitude and persistence of these changes is key in understanding the complex ways in which fire affects ecosystem functioning at smaller scales and will inform ongoing modeling efforts. We report the results of a field study in a semi-arid savanna in northern Botswana during the transition from dry to wet season (Oct-Dec) in 2012 and 2013. The goals of this study were to: (1) characterize the multifaceted effect that late dry-season fires have on fluxes and radiative surface processes during green-up, and (2) describe the timescales over which these variables recover to non-burnt levels. Our study synthesizes a suite of data, including flux tower measurements, vegetation sampling, time-lapse photography and concurrent remotely sensed variables over plots with variable burn patterns.\nAlbedo decreased immediately after fire, converging on unburned values 10 days post-burn. The magnitude and direction of this response was comparable to the albedo change elicited by strong rainfall events. Soil temperature and soil heat flux were not significantly modified by fire. Carbon fluxes showed no discernible difference from an unburned control site immediately after fire. There was a small burst in ecosystem respiration at immediately following the first post-fire rainfall event, returning to baseline values after 3 days. Persistent CO2 release, which we attribute to soil respiration, occurred for 10 days after successive strong wetting events, confirming the centrality of available moisture in determining ecosystem function. Fire delayed the green-up in some plots, but this effect was variable and short-lived. One month after fire there was no evidence of a difference in ground observations of greenness between burnt and control plots or plots that differed in their time of burning. We attribute the relatively ephemeral effects of fire to the low intensity ground fires at our site.

            "abstract": "Uncertainties posed by climate change and rapidly rising global water demand will place unprecedented pressures on already strained water resource systems. Successfully planning for these future changes requires a sound scientific understanding of the timing, location, and magnitude of climate change impacts on water needs and availability – not only on average trends, but also on interannual and decadal variability and associated uncertainties. In recent years, two types of large ensemble runs ­of climate projections have become available, those from groups of more than 20 different climate ­models, and those from repeated runs of several individual models. These have provided new approaches to the probabilistic evaluation of both climate change and the resulting effects on water resources. Using a range of available climate model ensembles, this research explores the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainty in projected river runoff and irrigation water requirements. The research compares the time of emergence of anthropogenic signals in precipitation against those of runoff and irrigation needs, considering emergence from both interannual and inter-model noise. Implications of the patterns of model uncertainty are discussed for water management in the U.S. and globally.",

            "abstract": "The solar cycle can be understood as a process that alternates the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun between poloidal and toroidal configurations. Although the process that transitions the solar cycle between toroidal and poloidal phases is still not fully understood, theoretical studies, and observational evidence, suggest that this process is driven by the emergence and decay of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) at the photosphere. Furthermore, the emergence of BMRs at the photosphere is the main driver behind solar variability and solar activity in general; making the study of their properties doubly important for heliospheric physics. However, in spite of their critical role, there is still no unified catalog of BMRs spanning multiple instruments and covering the entire period of systematic measurement of the solar magnetic field (i.e. 1975 to present).\nOne of the interesting aspects of the detection of BMRs is that, due to the time and spatial scales of interest, it is tractable for both human observers and automatic detection algorithms. This makes it ideal for comparative studies of the advantages and failing of both approaches. In this presentation we will compare three different BMR catalogs, reduced from magnetograms taken by SOHO/MDI, using human, automatic, and hybrid methods of detection. The focus will be the comparative performance between the three methods, their merits, and disadvantages, and the lessons that can be applied to other imaging data sets.",

Although the presence of macro-seeps can only be verified through visual confirmation, several studies suggest that gaseous bubbles emitted by seeps are uniquely detected in sonar water-column backscatter returns (Judd and Hovland, 1992; Nikolovska et al., 2008; Weber et al., 2012). In this study, more than 200 seeps were independently identified from a subset of water-column backscatter data collected in March and April, 2014. Additional data collected aboard the Okeanos Explorer includes bathymetry, seafloor backscatter, sub-bottom seismic reflection profiles, and ROV video footage. These datasets, along with calculated geomorphic parameters such as slope, were used to develop specialized mapping products to display physical characteristics of the seafloor and subsurface surrounding a number of gaseous seeps. Preliminary results indicate that seeps occur in a wide variety of geomorphic settings, including the edges of salt domes, and at depths ranging from approximately 300 meters to 1,100 meters. Study results could be used to make predictions about where seeps are most likely to be detected along the continental margin of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. These predictions could inform future efforts to study seeps and their associated biological communities within the study area or aid in the development of larger scale seep characterization and predictive modeling.",

            "abstract": "Geological repositories for disposal of high-level nuclear waste generally rely on a multi-barrier system to isolate radioactive waste from the biosphere. An engineered barrier system (EBS), which comprises in many design concepts a bentonite backfill, is widely used. Clay formations have been considered as a host rock throughout the world. Illitization, the transformation of smectite to illite, could compromise some beneficiary features of EBS bentonite and clay host rock such as sorption and swelling capacity. It is the major determining factor to establish the maximum design temperature of the repositories because it is believed that illitization could be greatly enhanced at temperatures higher than 100 oC. However, existing experimental and modeling studies on the occurrence of illitization and related performance impacts are not conclusive, in part because the relevant couplings between the thermal, hydrological, chemical, and mechanical (THMC) processes have not been fully represented in the models. Here we present a fully coupled THMC simulation study of a generic nuclear waste repository in a clay formation with a bentonite-backfilled EBS. Two scenarios were simulated for comparison: a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister can reach about 200 oC and a case in which the temperature in the bentonite near the waste canister peaks at about 100 oC. The model simulations demonstrate that illitization is in general more significant under higher temperature. However, the quantity of illitization is affected by many chemical factors and therefore varies a great deal. The most important chemical factors are the concentration of K in the pore water as well as the abundance and dissolution rate of K-feldspar. For the particular case and bentonite properties studied, the reduction in swelling stress as a result of chemical changes vary from 2% up to 70% depending on chemical and temperature conditions, and key mechanical parameters. The modeling work is illustrative in light of the relative importance of different processes occurring in EBS bentonite and clay host rock at higher than 100 oC conditions, and could be of greater use when site specific data are available.",

Euphausia pacifica is the dominant species of krill in Monterey Bay, CA, and a keystone species in the bay’s food web. Previous work on the effects of ocean acidification on the survival, growth and molting of E. pacifica have shown they are fairly tolerant to increased CO2 concentrations. However, less is known about energy costs associated with maintaining their internal pH levels which could affect food consumption, swimming behavior or growth activity.\n We hypothesized that krill exposed to high CO2 will increase their feeding rate on local species of phytoplankton to account for increased energy costs of pH buffering activity. We exposed experimental E. pacifica to waters of pH 7.6 (the expected pH surface waters in year 2100), and pH 8.0 (control) periods.test for acclimation or longer term stress. Feeding rates were calculated as changes in phytoplankton counts over 24 hours of feeding using Frost’s equations (Frost 1972). Understanding the way E. pacifica is affected by ocean acidification is important because of the role they play as the primary food source for a variety of predators necessary to maintain the Pacific’s ecology.",

The developed warning system integrates static controlling factors and dynamic triggering factors. The algorithm couples a susceptibility map with a rainfall I-D curve, both are developed using readily available remote sensing datasets. The static susceptibility map was constructed as follows: (1) an inventory was compiled for debris flows identified from high spatial resolution datasets and field verified; (2) 10 topographical and land cover predisposing factors (i.e. slope angle, slope aspect, normalized difference vegetation index, topographical position index, stream power index, flow accumulation, distance to drainage line, soil weathering index, elevation and topographic wetness index) were generated; (3) an artificial neural network model (ANN) was constructed, optimized and validated; (4) a debris-flow susceptibility map was generated using the ANN model and refined (using differential backscatter coefficient radar images). The rainfall threshold curve was derived as follows: (1) a spatial database was generated to host temporal co-registered and radiometrically and atmospherically corrected Landsat images; (2) temporal change detection images were generated for pairs of successively acquired Landsat images and criteria were established to identify “the change” related to debris flows, (3) the duration and intensity of the precipitation event that caused each of the identified debris flow events was assumed to be that of the most intense event within the investigated period; and (4) the I-D curve was extracted using data (intensity and duration of precipitation) for the inventoried events. Our findings include: (1) the spatial controlling factors with the highest predictive power of debris-flow locations are: topographic position index, slope, NDVI and distance to drainage line; (2) the ANN model showed an excellent prediction performance (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve: 0.961); 3) the preliminary I-D curve is I=39.797×D-0.7355 (I: Intensity and D: duration).",

            "abstract": "Producing undergraduates capable of broad, independent thinking is one of the grand challenges in science education. Experience-based learning, specifically hands-on research, is one mechanism for increasing students’ ability to think critically. With this in mind, we created a two-semester long research program called SUPER (Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research) aimed at teaching students to think like scientists and enhancing the student research experience through instruction and active-learning about the scientific method. Our aim was for students to gain knowledge, skills, and experience, and to conduct their own research. In the first semester, we hosted active-learning workshops on “Forming Hypotheses”, “Experimental Design”, “Collecting and Managing Data”, “Analysis of Data”, “Communicating to a Scientific Audience”, “Reading Literature Effectively”, and “Ethical Approaches”. Each lesson was taught by different scientists from one of many ecological disciplines so that students were exposed to the variation in approach that scientists have. In the second semester, students paired with a scientific mentor and began doing research. To ensure the continued growth of the undergraduate researcher, we continued the active-learning workshops and the students attended meetings with their mentors. Thus, the students gained technical and cognitive skills in parallel, enabling them to understand both “the how” and “the why” of what they were doing in their research. The program culminated with a research poster session presented by the students.\nThe interest in the program has grown beyond our expectations, and we have now run the program successfully for two years. Many of the students have gone on to campus research jobs, internships and graduate school, and have attributed part of their success in obtaining their positions to their experience with the SUPER program. Although common in other sciences, undergraduate research experiences are rare in ecology. We feel that development and implementation of these types of active-learning, research based programs can help universities to produce undergraduate researchers capable of contributing meaningfully to research, and to greater societal issues by enhancing their problem solving and critical thinking skills.",

The system utilizes the Navy’s Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), the Navy’s HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), and the Los Alamos National Laboratory’s sea ice (CICE) model for the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice model respectively. Using this model, we examine lead times needed to predict ice free conditions, and examine the model biases with multiple approaches. For the years 2013 and 2014, we perform hindcast runs starting at intervals of days to weeks before the minimum Arctic ice extent. As expected, shorter lead times lead to a better performance of the prediction of ice free periods, but biases associated with relatively short lead times (i.e., days) differ from biases associated with relatively longer lead (i.e., weeks) times. The representation of synoptic events is important during short lead times, while difficulties in representing surface fluxes are important for longer lead times. This study aids in the understanding of the important processes needed for sea ice prediction at different time-scales.",

            "abstract": "Long-term, high-resolution paleoclimate data has never been more important as a means of putting global climate change in context. The inherent complexities of natural climate variability require a very long paleoproxy record that spans many cycles of overlapping multi-scale climate oscillations, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in order to distinguish the true effects of climate change. The tropical region has important linkages to global climate regulation and its annual stability makes it highly sensitive to climate change. It is predicted that tropical ecosystems will experience greater climate-related stress than those located at the poles. Yet, this region has an underrepresentation of high-resolution terrestrial paleoclimate records, such as those derived from the tree ring archives. South Florida, like many areas of the subtropics, has few tree species that are suitable for dendrochronological studies due to non-visible or seasonally inconsistent ring production.\n This study examines the potential of Pinus elliottii trees from Big Pine Key as a high-resolution terrestrial paleoclimate proxy for South Florida. The trees were difficult to cross-date using standard dendrochronology techniques. Instead, a chronology extending from 1927 to 2005 was developed by cross-dating patterns in the δ13C records. There is a strong, but complex, correlation between δ13C, ENSO and the AMO. The δ13C record trends with ENSO during the cool phase of the AMO, but there is an inverse relationship between δ13C and ENSO during the warm phases. The transition in the relationship between δ13C and ENSO occurs about 5 years before the AMO phase shift. In addition, preliminary analysis shows that about 45% of the variance in the carbon isotope chronology is related to precipitation and the ENSO signal is captured through the timing of that precipitation. During El Niño years, there is an increase in dry season precipitation, so a decrease in δ13C is witnessed in the latewood; whereas during La Niña years, when winters and springs are drier but the summer precipitation is close to normal, there is a decrease in the δ13C of the earlywood. These P. elliottii trees show promise as a paleoclimate proxy for precipitation, ENSO and the AMO in subtropical Florida.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural ammonia (NH3) emissions are highly uncertain in current bottom-up inventories. Ammonium nitrate is a dominant component of fine aerosols in agricultural regions such as the Central Valley of California, especially during winter. Recent high resolution regional modeling efforts in this region have found significant ammonium nitrate and gas-phase NH3 biases during summer. We compare spatially-resolved surface and boundary layer gas-phase NH3 observations during NASA DISCOVER-AQ California with Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) regional model simulations driven by the EPA NEI 2008 inventory to constrain wintertime NH3 model biases. We evaluate model performance with respect to aerosol partitioning, mixing and deposition to constrain contributions to modeled NH3 concentration biases in the Central Valley Tulare dairy region. Ammonia measurements performed with an open-path mobile platform on a vehicle are gridded to 4 km resolution hourly background concentrations. A peak detection algorithm is applied to remove local feedlot emission peaks. Aircraft NH3, NH4+ and NO3- observations are also compared with simulations extracted along the flight tracks. We find NH3 background concentrations in the dairy region are underestimated by three to five times during winter and NH3 simulations are moderately correlated with observations (r = 0.36). Although model simulations capture NH3 enhancements in the dairy region, these simulations are biased low by 30-60 ppbv NH3. Aerosol NH4+ and NO3- are also biased low in CMAQ by three and four times respectively. Unlike gas-phase NH3, CMAQ simulations do not capture typical NH4+ or NO3- enhancements observed in the dairy region. In contrast, boundary layer height simulations agree well with observations within 13%. We also address observational constraints on simulated NH3 deposition fluxes. These comparisons suggest that NEI 2008 wintertime dairy emissions are underestimated by a factor of three to five. We test sensitivity to emissions by increasing the NEI 2008 NH3 emissions uniformly across the dairy region and evaluate the impact on modeled concentrations. These results are applicable to improving predictions of ammoniated aerosol loading and highlight the value of mobile platform spatial NH3 measurements to constrain emission inventories.",

            "abstract": "Bed load transport is a notoriously unpredictable process. A primary component of this unpredictability arises from stochastic fluctuations which require non-trivial averaging. This averaging must be informed by the length and time scales of the fluctuations, and a rigorous method for arriving at the proper averaging scales must link grain scale motion to macroscopic transport. A statistical mechanical framework has been suggested by Furbish and colleagues to accomplish this goal. This model assumes that grain motion is independent of other particles. Experiments show that this is not the case, and that bed load fluctuations possess length and time scales larger than any hydrodynamic scaling. This indicates that fluctuations in grain motion are correlated; as hydrodynamics cannot explain this behavior, we posit that its origins lie in the granular dynamics of bed load transport. Evidence to support this view can be found in the work of Ancey and colleagues where they show that, upon approaching the threshold of motion: intermittency of transport grows, dynamics of grain motion slow down, and collective entrainment occurs. These behaviors are hallmarks of a disordered system approaching a jamming transition, or the point where motion ceases. This points to the utility of using the jamming framework to study transport near threshold. We seek to use this framework to document the occurrence and understand the origins of the collective entrainment of grains. This is done using a 2D experiment with spherical particles driven by a turbulent flow where collisions are a significant driver of entrainment due to the momentum transfer that occurs when saltating particles collide with the bed. We characterize the collective particle motion observed in the system using the Χ4 susceptibility. This measure uses the variance of the displacement of a population of sediment in the system to characterize the timescales at which a subset of grains move collectively relative to the rest of the system. We find evidence that the correlation scales of collective particle dynamics change with the driving rate. These observations elucidate the granular contributions to stochastic bed load transport, and demonstrate how the requisite averaging time for bed load measurements increases rapidly on approach to the threshold of motion.",

            "abstract": "We apply cluster and factor analyses to bulk chemical data of 130 soil and rock samples measured by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity through sol 650. Multivariate approaches such as principal components analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and factor analysis compliment more traditional approaches (e.g., Harker diagrams), with the advantage of simultaneously examining the relationships between multiple variables for large numbers of samples. Principal components analysis has been applied with success to APXS, Pancam, and Mössbauer data from the Mars Exploration Rovers. Factor analysis and cluster analysis have been applied with success to thermal infrared (TIR) spectral data of Mars. Cluster analyses group the input data by similarity, where there are a number of different methods for defining similarity (hierarchical, density, distribution, etc.). For example, without any assumptions about the chemical contributions of surface dust, preliminary hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses clearly distinguish the physically adjacent rock targets Windjana and Stephen as being distinctly different than lithologies observed prior to Curiosity’s arrival at The Kimberley. In addition, they are separated from each other, consistent with chemical trends observed in variation diagrams but without requiring assumptions about chemical relationships. We will discuss the variation in cluster analysis results as a function of clustering method and pre-processing (e.g., log transformation, correction for dust cover) and implications for interpreting chemical data. Factor analysis shares some similarities with PCA, and examines the variability among observed components of a dataset so as to reveal variations attributable to unobserved components. Factor analysis has been used to extract the TIR spectra of components that are typically observed in mixtures and only rarely in isolation; there is the potential for similar results with data from APXS. These techniques offer new ways to understand the chemical relationships between the materials interrogated by Curiosity, and potentially their relation to materials observed by APXS instruments on other landed missions.",

            "abstract": "Inland waters act as an important control on the global carbon cycle. Deep tectonic lakes may provide a key link between short-term and long-term carbon cycles as buried carbon is essentially locked away from the atmosphere over geological timescales. Here we investigate Holocene carbon dynamics in one of the worlds most important lake ecosystems, Lake Baikal, Siberia. We test the hypothesis that multiple factors play a significant role in determining long-term carbon dynamics in central Asia, and that these factors change in importance over time.\nCarbon isotopes (δ13C), percentage total organic carbon (%TOC) were analysed during combustion in a Carlo Erba 1500 on-line to a VG Triple Trap and dual-inlet mass spectrometer. A multi-decadal organic geochemistry record (%TOC; δ13C, C/N ratios) was determined on Holocene sediments extracted from a slope terrace c. 600 m deep. Age-depth modelling on radiocarbon-dated pollen extracts was undertaken using ‘Bacon’, which takes into account variable sediment accumulation rates. Carbon mass accumulation rates (CMAR; g cm-2 yr-1) were estimated at a centennial scale resolution.\nδ13C values were routinely higher during cool glacial periods (-26 ‰) than during warmer climates (-28 ‰) linked to changes in carbon sources. Diatom productivity & boreal forest expansion were strongly associated with δ13C variability during the early Holocene, but after 8 kyr BP, no relationships are apparent. CMAR were highest during the early Holocene (11.7 – 8 kyr BP) although rates fluctuated considerably. Peak values of 12.5 g cm-2 yr-1 were observed at 10.35 kyr BP before a rapid decline to c. 5.2 g cm-2 yr-1 at 10.05 kyr BP. CMAR declined to lowest Holocene values of 3.5 g cm-2 yr-1 by 3.9 kyr BP at the same time as maximum δ13C values (-27.0 ‰), indicative of low palaeoproductivity.\nOur data show that measures of palaeoproductivity in Lake Baikal are complex, and during the early Holocene are strongly associated with allochthonous inputs mediated by taiga forest expansion and fluvial input into the lake. Minima in Holocene palaeoproductivity are coincident with peaks in hematite stained grains in North Atlantic sediments, a proxy for ice-rafted debris, highlighting tight linkages via teleconnection processes between changes in the North Atlantic and remote central Asia.",

However, empirical lake surface sediment calibrations of the brGDGT-temperature relationship yield uncertainties of several degrees, which limits the application of this approach to orbital and millennial scale reconstructions. Little has been done to assess the relative importance of within-lake processes on the variability in brGDGT climate reconstructions and uncertainties in mean annual air temperature estimates. To address this, we examined brGDGT variations in the surface sediments and in a high-resolution varved sediment sequence from anoxic Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. Lake surface sediment samples show significant variations in brGDGT distributions in shallow water, but yield temperature estimates that are generally consistent with measured lake water temperatures in sediments from throughout the deepest part of the lake. Down-core temperature reconstructions show multidecadal to centennial scale trends that are broadly consistent with a cooler Little Ice Age and recent warming. However, on shorter timescales reconstructed temperature variations are much larger than expected (1-2°C) based on instrumental air temperature data, complicating the interpretation of the brGDGT temperature data. We hypothesize that these variations are related to within-lake processes that affect brGDGT production such as the depth and timing of mixing events.",

            "abstract": "Predicting streamflow in headwaters and over a broad spatial scale pose unique challenges due to limited data availability. Flow observation gages for headwaters streams are less common than for larger rivers, and gages with records lengths of ten year or more are even more scarce. Thus, there is a great need for estimating streamflows in ungaged or sparsely-gaged headwaters. Further, there is often insufficient basin information to develop rainfall-runoff models that could be used to predict future flows under various climate scenarios.\nHeadwaters in the northeastern U.S. are of particular concern to aquatic biologists, as these stream serve as essential habitat for native coldwater fish. In order to understand fish response to past or future environmental drivers, estimates of seasonal streamflow are needed.\nWhile there is limited flow data, there is a wealth of data for historic weather conditions. Observed data has been modeled to interpolate a spatially continuous historic weather dataset. (Mauer et al 2002).\nWe present a statistical model developed by pairing streamflow observations with precipitation and temperature information for the same and preceding time-steps. We demonstrate this model's use to predict flow metrics at the seasonal time-step. While not a physical model, this statistical model represents the weather drivers. Since this model can predict flows not directly tied to reference gages, we can generate flow estimates for historic as well as potential future conditions.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable empirical evidence that the specific energy ε determined from shallow scratch tests on sedimentary rocks is about equal to the uniaxial compressive strength q, see Figure showing the correlation between ε and q for 334 rocks (Richard et al, J Engineering Geology, 2012). The specific energy ε, defined as the energy expended per unit volume of fragmented rock, corresponds to the ratio of the average cutting force over the cross-sectional area of the groove created by the motion of the cutter; it is virtually independent of the depth of cut provided that the cutter is sufficiently sharp so that frictional dissipation beneath the cutter is negligible and also provided that the depth of cut is below a critical value dc that is proportional to the intrinsic length scale (KIc/q)2 with KIc denoting the rock toughness. Indeed, the critical depth of cut dc separates two regimes of cutting, ductile and brittle. In the ductile regime (depth of cut d smaller than dc but larger than the grain size), the rock is intensively sheared ahead of the cutter and the specific energy is constant. On the other hand, in the brittle regime (d larger than dc) chipping takes place and the specific energy decreases as the inverse square root of d. In sedimentary rocks, dcis typically less than 1 mm.\nThe apparent correlation between the specific energy ε in the ductile regime and the uniaxial compressive strength q can be explained from an analysis of results of plane strain compression tests conducted in an apparatus that does not inhibit the development of shear bands (Labuz and Dai, J. of Geotechnical and Reoenvironmental Eng., 2000). This analysis indicates that the residual strength is reached on the shear band for slip distance of about 1~2 grain size and that the thickness of the shear band is also equal to about 2 grain size. Furthermore, the ratio of the energy required to destroy the cohesive links between the grains inside the shear band over the volume of the shear band can be shown to be indeed comparable to q. The specific energies pertaining to the compression test and the scratch test are thus comparable, not only because there is complete de-cohesion of the constitutive matrix in both cases, but also because the strains are of order 1 in both tests.",

            "abstract": "We conducted a satellite-based survey of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) sediment processes using all images of Greenland in the Landsat7 archive (1999 – 2013). Imaging over 150 proglacial rivers near their ice sheet source to calculate median suspended sediment concentration (SSC) for the Landsat7 era, we find ice sheet evacuation of suspended sediment via rivers is highly spatially variable, with a small percentage of ice sheet termini evacuating sediment at elevated SSCs. Most (67 %) of termini had a median SSC value less than 1000 mg/l, while only 8% had values greater than 2000 mg/l, yet these termini with SSC in excess of 2000 mg/l export ~90 % of suspended sediment from the ice sheet. Combining surface ice velocity data and ice thickness data we find that ice discharge at ice sheet termini largely drives this spatial variability in SSC.\nThough 1% of the Earth’s land surface area, using modeled ice sheet runoff we estimate that the GrIS exports 6 to 11 % of the total sediment export to the global ocean if all sediment is assumed to reach the ocean. Finally, we find river mouth SSC high enough to cause hyperpycnal flow to occur. Hence, sediment can at times be efficiently mobilized from ice sheet directly to fjord bottom/continental shelf.",

SNAC is a deep earth process model (a geodynamic/tectonics model), built upon a scientific software framework called StGermain and also compatible with a model coupling framework called Pyre. CHILD is a popular surface process model (a landscape evolution model), interfaced to the CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) modeling framework. We first present proof-of-concept but non-trivial results from a simplistic coupling scheme. We then report progress towards augmenting SNAC with a Basic Model Interface (BMI), a framework-agnostic standard interface developed by CSDMS that uses the CSDMS Standard Names as controlled vocabulary for model communication across domains. Newly interfaced to BMI, SNAC will be easily coupled with CHILD as well as other BMI-compatible models. In broader context, this work will test BMI as a general and easy-to-implement mechanism for sharing models between modeling frameworks and is a part of the NSF-funded EarthCube Building Blocks project, \"Earth System Bridge: Spanning Scientific Communities with Interoperable Modeling Frameworks.”",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) contamination is considered one of the greatest threats to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the San Francisco Estuary ecosystems. This threat is driven by the transformation of Hg, deposited in the Delta from erosion of upstream historic mining debris and atmospheric deposition, by native bacteria into the more toxic and biologically available form, methylmercury (MeHg), in the wetlands and sediment of the Delta. To effectively manage this threat, a quantitative understanding of the relative contribution of the different Hg sources to MeHg formation is needed. Mass balance estimates indicate as much as 99% of the Hg entering the Delta arrives via tributary inputs. Of the tributary Hg load, approximately 90% is adsorbed to suspended particles from tributary discharge and 10% is in the dissolved fraction, potentially of atmospheric origin. In comparison, the remaining 1-2% of the Hg entering the Delta arrives through direct atmospheric deposition (wet and dry). The relative importance of these sources to MeHg production within the Delta is not linearly related to the mass inputs because atmospherically-derived Hg is believed to be more reactive than sediment-bound Hg with respect to MeHg formation. We conducted an in situ mesocosm dosing experiment where different Hg sources to the Delta (direct atmospheric, dissolved riverine and suspended sediment) were “labeled” with different stable Hg isotopes and added to mesocosms within four different wetlands. Mercury isotopes added with the streambed sediments were equilibrated in sealed containers for six months; while the Hg isotopes associated with the precipitation and river water were equilibrated for 24 hours prior to use. After adding the isotopes, we sampled the water column, overlying air, bottom sediments and fish (Gambusia) at time intervals up to 30 days. Preliminary results from this experiment suggest that aqueous Hg sources (Hg introduced with precipitation and filtered river water) are 10-1,000x more available to methylating microbes and fish uptake than particle bound Hg. Consequently, although atmospheric Hg deposition may contribute a relatively small portion of the total Hg loading to the Delta, it may contribute to a substantial portion of the MeHg produced within the Delta.",

In this study, we develop and apply an integrated and cost-effective approach, involving geophysical, geochemical, isotopic, field, and remote sensing investigations to understand the origin, evolution, and the factors controlling the paleo and current distribution of the RAKAS groundwater. Paleohydrological setting of the RAK is investigated by exploring the spatial relations between plaeo-drainage, paleo-lakes, faults, and sapping features. The following investigations were accomplished: (1) groundwater samples were collected from wells in the western portion of the Rub Al Khali and analyzed for their solute chemistry, stable isotopic composition (O, H), and Cl-36 and C-14 ages; (2) paleo-topography (prior to dune encroachment) was extracted using elevations within inter-dunal areas; (3) drainage systems were extracted using standard stream delineation techniques; (4) a regional mosaic of dual polarized (HH,HV) ALOS PALSAR data (10 m resolution) was created covering entire Arabian Peninsula; (5) paleo-drainage systems across the RAK were mapped using PALSAR data and SRTM-derived networks; and (6) Landsat 8 imagery and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were used to map the distribution of paleo-lakes and to delineate sapping features. Findings include: (1) presence of relatively fresh (TDS ranging from 800 - 2,800 mg/L in deeper wells) suitable for drinking and/or irrigation; (2) major ions are Na, Ca, Cl, SO4 and HCO3; (3) radiocarbon model ages range from 1,400 to 30,600 years before present, but conservative Cl-36 model ages indicate much higher residence time (up to 750,000 years or more); (4) Cl-36 ages and stable isotopic compositions indicate that groundwater recharge in previous wet climatic periods; (5) features with stubby looking geometry, theater-like heads, U-shaped profile, flat floors and structurally controlled patterns indicative of sapping processes were mapped along scarps; (6) landscape analysis indicate onset of stream networks from mapped sapping features along escarpments suggesting groundwater discharge; and (7) large paleodrainage patterns indicate a general runoff direction from west to east.",

Fractionation of its stable isotopes has been shown to be useful indicators of many geological, chemical and biological processes. For example, biogenic carbonates display ~5‰ range of d26Mg values, which is attributed to variable degree of biological control on Mg ions during biomineralisation. Understanding this biological control is essential for developing proxies based on biogenic carbonates. Current methods of magnesium isotope measurements in carbonates are often time consuming and require relatively large volumes of samples. In this work, we present a new approach of measuring Mg isotopes in biogenic carbonates using Laser Ablation MC-ICP-MS. We will show that this microanalytical approach provides accurate and relatively fast measurements of Mg isotopes in biological carbonate with precision down to 0.2‰ (1sd). We will also present examples on how this new method can provide additional information about foraminiferal biomineralisation. For example, we will demonstrate submicron variation in Mg isotopes across shells of Orbulina universa, which are linked to high and low Mg/Ca layers in this species. We will also report changes in Mg isotope composition of benthic foraminifera Amphistegina sp. cultured in seawater with different Mg/Ca values. Both examples will be used to draw attention to the complexity and possibilities of multiple mechanisms of Mg incorporation into biogenic carbonates during biomineralisation.",

This goal is being achieved through awards to support undergraduate and graduate level student scholarships and to enhance NOAA mission-relevant education, research and internships at EPP Cooperative Science Centers located at MSIs. The internships allow undergraduate students to gain technical experience in STEM fields while gaining an understanding of a science mission agency such as NOAA. EPP has built evidence supporting the value of internships with its Undergraduate Scholarship Program (USP). Program metrics are used to refine and improve the internship to ensure student success. Scholarships are competitively awarded and requires applicants to submit a personal statement detailing the NOAA-relevant professional experience the applicant seeks to acquire, and gauges the depth of understanding of the work of NOAA.\nA focus is the EPP USP Student Internship at NOAA, which has two training phases. The first occurs at NOAA HQ in Maryland and incorporates exposure to NOAA professional culture including mentoring and professional development for scholarship recipients. The second occurs at NOAA facilities in the 50 states and US Territories. The internship projects are conducted under the supervision of a NOAA mentor and allow the scholars to: acquire increased science and technology skills: be attached to a research group and participate in a research activity as part of the team; and, acquire practical experience and knowledge of the day-to-day work of the NOAA facility. EPP has recently initiated the Experiential Research and Training Opportunities (NERTO) for students from the CSCs. The NERTO is a longer term immersion at NOAA facilities, with a NOAA mentor working collaboratively with their academic advisor on a NOAA science priority.

Lake Tahoe and its contributing watersheds exhibit high climatic (precipitation, temperature) and hydrologic (streamflow, evaporation) variation that exert significant control over regional water supply on annual and sub-annual timescales. To adequately quantify these controls, a high resolution (300m) physically based integrated surface and groundwater model, GSFLOW, of the Tahoe basin has been developed to identify key hydrologic mechanisms that explain recent changes in water resources of the region. The model is parameterized using geographical datasets and maintains a balance between (a) accurate representation of spatial (e.g., geology, streams, and topography) and hydrologic (groundwater, stream, lake, and wetland flows and storages) features, and (b) computational efficiency, which is a necessity for exploring critical vulnerabilities of water-supplies in the region. The calibrated model reproduces multiple observations of streamflow, snow water equivalent, satellite derived snow covered area, lake stage, and groundwater head. Climate input uncertainty was significantly decreased in the model through incorporating additional precipitation station data and helped improve model simulations of observed fluxes more than adjusting model parameters alone. The model simulates fluxes at the outlet of the watershed, but is also consistent at simulating streamflow at internal nodes. This integrated modeling framework helped assess both surface and groundwater resources in a coupled manner in the Tahoe basin.",

            "abstract": "The San Marcos Pueblo, one of the largest and most important cities of the pre-European Southwest, has long been a place of curiosity for archaeologists and geophysicists alike. Despite numerous archaeological investigations, primarily test excavations and surface surveys carried out at San Marcos from the early 1900s to the present, the site retains pottery sherds scattered along the surface from when it was first occupied in the thirteenth century to its abandonment during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Geophysical investigations have identified locations of kivas (ceremonial pits), middens (trash heaps), room blocks and possible metallurgy activity in the area. The site is located south of Santa Fe, NM and to the east of the Cerrillos Hills, a source for lead ore and turquoise.\nThe students of SAGE have studied the San Marcos Pueblo for the past 11 years, and produced a map of the northeastern portion of the Pueblo colloquially called ‘El Mapa Grande.’ Ground penetrating radar (GPR), magnetics, and electromagnetic (EM) data were acquired on 30mx30m grids and seismic refraction data on various profiles throughout El Mapa Grande. During the 2014 field season new GPR data were acquired on two grids, magnetics data on one, and multiple grids were resurveyed with magnetics and EM to enhance resolution. The most recent GPR data extend coverage of two large anomalies that are part of linear EW-trending structures previously identified and consistent with a possible block wall or midden. Low GPR scatter and circular magnetic lows define several kivas. A target area in the NE of El Mapa Grande was thought to be related to metallurgic activity. Analysis of previous seismic data did not resolve any subsurface features corresponding to a metallurgy operation, but detected the magnetically-chaotic Ancha formation. Comparison with magnetic profile data support the interpretation that this anomaly is caused by a sub-crop of the Ancha Formation.",

            "abstract": "Climate change in Arctic wetlands is resulting in a widening phenological mismatch between the onset of the growing season and the arrival and hatch date of migratory geese, the primary consumers in the system. During the past three decades, the growing season has advanced but geese have not advanced arrival or hatch date at the same rate. Geese now arrive into a system that has been growing longer than in the past with potential changes in forage quality because sedges have their highest nutrient density shortly following emergence. One potential concomitant result of this phenological gap is altered carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) of leaf tissue being returned to the ecosystem as feces that is more N-poor. Altering the C:N of these inputs can further influence C and N cycling in the system. We examine the influence of advanced growing season and different arrival times by black brant on leaf and soil C:N ratio and soil N-form. Our experiment consists of six blocks with nine study plots each. Half the plots are warmed to advance the growing season. Two plots each receive early, typical, late, and no grazing; one plot is a control that is not warmed and grazing is natural. Leaf tissue was collected to determine C and N concentration using an elemental analyzer. Anion and cation exchange membranes were used to monitor inorganic N forms in soil; samples were analyzed via fluorescence following extraction. Soil water collected from lysimeters was analyzed for organic N. Warming advanced plant growth between one and two weeks and resulted in higher C:N of leaf tissue Geese maintained ‘grazing lawns’, areas of exceptionally short vegetation, where plants had high N compared to non-grazed areas. Grazing early in the season promoted higher N content of leaves and soil while grazing late had little influence on N. The timing of the growing season and grazing both have important implications for C and N in this system.",

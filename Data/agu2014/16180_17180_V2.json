            "abstract": "Along the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta Burma Arc collision zone, the Indian plate is converging obliquely with the Burma arc with a shortening GPS rate of 14 mm/yr. In this region tectonics, huge sediment supply from the erosion of the Himalayas (>1 GT/yr) and relative sea level changes interact. The extremely thick sediments of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and Fan (~20 km) are being gradually accreted into a very wide thrust-fold belt along this subduction/collision zone. This interaction has led to the formation of a fold-and-thrust belt and wide accretionary prism that is exposed on land and on the shelf of the Burma forearc. Sedimentary sequence and structure document the seismo-tectonic and sedimentary evolution of St Martin’s Island, which is an expression of an anticline in the outer part of the accretion forearc. During late Pleistocene sea-level low stands, the anticline and most of the rest of the shelf were exposed. The anticline ridge could then grow, receiving little erosion by local drainages. At some point during sea level rise, the coast advanced over the ridge and bevelled it. Then sea-level continued to rise and new sediment deposited forming an angular unconformity. A low-relief unconformity, in fact, separates the folded strata below from overlying strata of Holocene age. Where now exposed on the island above sea level, the unconformity is ~8000 y old. At that time, sea level was 30 m below the current level and thus rapid tectonic uplift is necessary to account for its current elevation. Dead coral heads of the species Porities that populate the coast were dated with U-Th (Mondal et al., 2013). They document a megathurst rupture and ~ 2m uplift that occurred during the Great Arakan earthquake in 1762 and further earthquakes are likely at ~ 1100 and 800 AD.\nStudies of the 1762 rupture suggest that the anticline rises during megathrust earthquakes (~2m) and subsides in the interseismic period (a few mm/yr; Steckler and Mondal 2014). Radiocarbon ages that are being obtained from marine fossils recovered from trenches in the southern and northern parts of the island will be coupled to coral uplift studies. They will permit us to better constrain the relation between erosion and sedimentation of the anticline, as well as its growth and subsidence during coseismic and interseismic periods.",

            "abstract": "Observations show that CMEs can deflect from a purely radial trajectory yet no consensus exists as to the cause of these deflections. The majority of the deflection motion occurs in the corona at distances where the magnetic energy dominates. Accordingly, many theories attribute the CME deflection to magnetic forces. In Kay et al. (2013) we presented ForeCAT, a model for CME deflections based on the magnetic forces (magnetic tension and magnetic pressure gradients). Kay et al. (2014) introduced an improved three-dimensional version of ForeCAT. Here we study the 2008 December 12 CME which occurred during solar minimum of Solar Cycle 24 (Byrne et al 2010, Gui et al. 2011, Liu et al 2010a,b). This CME erupted from high latitudes, and, despite the weak background magnetic field, deflected to the ecliptic, impacting Earth. From the observations, we are able to constrain all of the ForeCAT input parameters except for the CME mass and the drag coefficient that affects the CME motion. The reduced chi-square best fit to the observations constrains the CME mass range to 3e14 to 7e14 g and the drag coefficient range to 1.9 to 2.4. We explore the effects of a different magnetic background which decreases less rapidly than our standard Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, as type II radio bursts suggest that the PFSS magnetic field decays too rapidly above active regions. For the case of the filament eruption of 2008 December 12 we find that the quiet sun coronal magnetic field should behave similar to the PFSS model. Finally, we present our current work exploring the case of the 2008 April 9 CME.",

            "abstract": "The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) has developed a number of tools for assessing the socioeconomic benefit of Earth Observation such as quantifying the monetary benefit of improved land cover information for mitigation policies. Recently, IIASA has been assessing the benefit of an improved global carbon observation system in the GEOCARBON Project.\nBecause traditional ground-based land cover validation is expensive, IIASA has developed crowdsourcing projects such as Geo-Wiki which to contribute to land-cover validation. A recent activity is the ‘Cropland Capture’ game which can be played in a browser or mobile device. It can be downloaded or played online at http://www.geo-wiki.org/games/croplandcapture/. In the game, players see an image (from a satellite or ground-based camera) and are asked if they see any cropland in it. They can answer “yes”, “no” or “maybe” if they are unsure. The game had over 3,000 players who made about 4,500,000 classifications on 190,000 unique images.\nThe benefits delivered by crowdsourcing relative to conventional data acquisition depends critically on the quality of the data received. Players’ rating quality was compared by assessing their agreement with the crowd, consistency on images rated more than once, and agreement with expert validators. These metrics were compared with one another and with potential predictors of user quality: the total number of images rated by a player, and their professional background in land-cover science.\nIndividual users’ agreement with the crowd and self-agreement were highly positively correlated. The frequency of admitting uncertainty about an image was a good measure of user caution, showing a negative relationship with self-contradiction rate. Many users were more reliable in either identifying cropland or non-cropland, and these two skills were uncorrelated. Overall, user reliability increased with number of images rated, although among the top decile of users, this trend was reversed. Surprisingly, professional background had little influence on quality of ratings. We explore implications of these results for assessing potential benefits of user contributed data in the context of differential user quality and compare this with conventional data collection methods.",

            "abstract": "As the largest rocky layer in the Earth, the lower mantle plays a critical role in controlling convective patterns in our planet. Current mineralogical mantle models suggest that the lower mantle is dominated by (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite (SiPv; about 70 – 90% in volume fraction) and (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase (Fp). Knowledge of rheological properties of the major constituent minerals and stress/strain partitioning among these phases during deformation is critical in understanding dynamic processes of the deep Earth.\nFor the lower mantle, the strength contrast between SiPv and Fp has been estimated [1], the former being much stronger than the latter. However fundamental issues of stress-strain interactions among the major phases still remain to be properly addressed. Here we examine rheological properties of a two-phase polycrystal consisting of CaGeO3 perovskite (GePv) and MgO, deformed in the D-DIA at controlled speed ~1 – 3×10-5 s-1 at high pressures and temperatures (between 3 to 10 GPa and 300 to 1200 K), with bulk axial strains up to ~20% [2]. We use Elasto-ViscoPlastic Self-Consistent modeling (EVPSC) [3] to reproduce lattice strains and textures measured in-situ with synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We compare the results to those on an identical deformation experiment with a single phase (GePv) polycrystal. We will discuss stress distributions between the two phases in the composite, textural developments, relationships with active slip systems, and finally the potential implications for rheological properties of the lower mantle.\n[1] Yamazaki, D., and S.

            "abstract": "We have developed a new altimeter proxy based on the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of surficial accumulations of salts in hyperarid settings. Under hyperarid conditions like in the Andean forearc in northern Chile at altitudes below ~3000 m.a.s.l., gypsum and other soluble salts form saline soils. The altimeter is based on the first-order topographic control on the extent of inland incursion of fog-transported marine aerosols derived from the Pacific Ocean. Once this fog is evaporated it deposits calcium sulfates with a marine 87Sr/86Sr signal. At positions in the landscape not reached by marine aerosols, calcium sulfates have no marine source, except by eolian reworking, and have a lower 87Sr/86Sr. 87Sr/86Sr values for Holocene accumulations of salts show a bimodal distribution: high values between 225–1075 m.a.s.l. (0.70807 ± 0.00004) and low values below and above those altitude thresholds (0.70746 ± 0.00010). We sampled dated gypsic relict soils and Gypsisols to study post-5 Ma surface height evolution using this method, after correcting for changes in the altitudinal structure of the paleo-fog zone with time.\nLocations spanning ~250 km strike-parallel distance within the forearc and at elevations between 450–1650 m.a.s.l. display moderate amounts of altitudinal change during the Pliocene, Pleistocene and Quaternary. Site results include two in the northern zone (19.5ºS and 19.65ºS) that experienced maximum net surface uplifts of ~350 m and ~600 m since 2.5 ± 0.5 Ma and ~2.6 Ma, respectively. Locations at ~21.4°S display an estimated minimum net decline in altitude of ~250 m since 3.4 ± 1.1 Ma and ~200 m since 1.1 ± 0.4 Ma.\nThese constraints will shed light on the geodynamic processes responsible for surface elevation change, by acting as boundary conditions to numerical models of the Andean forearc.",

            "abstract": "Experimental determination of the pressure and temperature controls on Ti solubility in quartz provide a calibration of the Ti-in-quartz (TitaniQ) geothermometer applicable to geologic conditions up to ~20 kbar (Thomas et al. (2010) Contrib Mineral Petrol 160, 743-759). One of the greatest limitations to analyzing Ti in metamorphic quartz by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is the lack of a suitable matrix-matched reference material. Typically LA-ICP-MS analyses of Ti in minerals use 49Ti as a normalizing mass because of an isobaric interference from 48Ca, which is present in most well characterized reference glasses, on 48Ti. The benefit of using a matrix-matched reference material to analyze Ti in quartz is the opportunity to use 48Ti (73.8 % abundance) as a normalizing mass, which results in an order of magnitude increase in signal strength compared to the less abundant isotope 49Ti (5.5 % abundance), thereby increasing the analytical precision. Here we characterize Ti-bearing SiO2 glasses from Heraeus Quarzglas and natural quartz grains from the Bishop Tuff by cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and LA-ICP-MS, in order to determine their viability as reference materials for Ti in quartz. Titanium contents in low-CL rims in the Bishop Tuff quartz grains were determined to be homogenous by EPMA (41 ± 2 µg/g Ti, 2σ), and are a potential natural reference material.\nWe present a new method for determining 48Ti concentrations in quartz by LA-ICP-MS at the 1 µg/g level, relevant to quartz in HP-LT terranes. We suggest that natural quartz such as the homogeneous low-CL rims of the Bishop Tuff quartz are more suitable than NIST reference glasses as an in-house reference material for low Ti concentrations because matrix effects are limited and Ca isobaric interferences are avoided, thus allowing for the use of 48Ti as a normalizing mass. Titanium concentration from 33 analyses of low-temperature quartz from the Czech Erzgebirge is 0.9 ± 0.2 µg/g (2σ) using 48Ti as a normalizing mass and the Bishop Tuff quartz rims as a reference material. The 2σ average analytical uncertainty for analyses of 48Ti is 8 % for 50 µm spots and 7 % for 100 µm spots, which offers much greater precision than the 35 % uncertainty (2σ) incurred from using 49Ti as a normalizing mass.",

            "abstract": "Climate change will affect global forest C dynamics. This study was conducted to predict the changes in C stocks and annual C sequestration rates of South Korean forests using the Korean Forest Soil Carbon (KFSC) model under the Constant Temperature (CT) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios (2012–2100). The simulation unit was each permanent sampling plots of the 5th Korean National Forest Inventory. The C pools were initialized at 2012, and disturbance was not considered during the simulation period. The annual mean temperature and precipitation were established based on the RCP 8.5 data. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the forest C stocks were 3–7% less than those stocks under the CT scenario. For broadleaf species, the forest C stocks increased from 599.6 Tg C in 2012 to 1058.0 (CT scenario) or 986.7 Tg C (RCP 8.5 scenario) in 2100. For needleleaf species, the forest C stocks increased from 385.4 Tg C in 2012 to 585.0 (CT scenario) or 568.6 Tg C (RCP 8.5 scenario) in 2100. Accordingly, the annual C sequestration rates of those forest types in South Korea over the simulation period under the RCP 8.5 scenario (57.4 and 144.5 g C m-2 yr-1 for broadleaf and needleleaf species, respectively) were lower than those values under the CT scenario (62.5 and 171.2 g C m-2 yr-1 for broadleaf and needleleaf species, respectively). Those differences between the climate scenarios were attributed to changes in decay rates of the dead organic matter due to temperature increase. We concluded that the C sequestration potential of South Korean forests could be decreased by climate change.",

            "abstract": "Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are unique bacterial lipids that commonly occur in soil and peat bog. The methylation and cyclization degrees of brGDGTs, expressed as MBT and CBT, respectively, are mainly controlled by mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH. However, the brGDGT-derived temperatures scatter widely compared to actual MAATs in both regional and global calibrations. In this study, we collected 297 soil samples from diverse regions of China (Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Yunnan, Dongying and Tibetan Plateau) in order to identify environmental variables that control the distribution of brGDGTs locally. The results show that MBT correlated positively with MAAT under the global calibration framework; however, large variation in MBT occurred for a given MAAT for individual regions. When confined within a specific region, MBT index positively correlated with conductivity in Dongying soils and negatively with pH in Yunnan and Guangzhou soils. Removing GDGT-II from CBT calculation resulted in a revised CBT index that provides more accurate estimation of pH (R2=0.79 vs 0.67), especially in alkaline soils. In addition, the combination of MBT and revised CBT also improves the estimation of soil pH (R2 =0.79) than the original CBT index alone (R2=0.67). Our results demonstrate that brGDGTs-derived proxies may be more reliable for estimating paleo-soil pH than paleo-continental temperature.",

Accordingly, the Amazon Basin has become an important aspect of South America; it is an area of extraordinary biodiversity, rich resources, and unique cultures. However, due to the sheer magnitude and exceptionality of the Amazon River, research regarding the morphodynamic processes that shape and define the river has been difficult. Consequently, current research has not completely understood the planform dynamics of some portions of this river that present a main channel and secondary channels known as “anabranching structures”.\nThe purpose of this research was to gain an understanding of the geomorphology of the upper Amazon, the Peruvian section, by obtaining migration rates and planform metrics, including channel count, length, width, and sinuosity, as well as island count, area, and shape. With this data, the morphodynamics of the Peruvian Amazon, especially the relationship between the main channel and its secondary channels in each “anabranching structure” along the river, could be analyzed according to correlations found between various metrics. This analysis was carried out for 5-year time spans over a period of 25 years. Preliminary results showed that the average migration rate versus channel bend radius envelope peak is lower for the secondary channels than for the main channel. However, the maximum migration rate was not always found in the main channel; for several structures, the most dynamic channels were the secondary ones. This implies a certain periodicity to the river’s migratory patterns that could be related to the valley boundaries, the local channel sinuosity or geological formations in the study area.",

            "abstract": "Drylands comprise ≈40% of the terrestrial Earth surface and observations suggest they can respond markedly to climate change. A vital component of dryland ecosystems are biological soil crusts (biocrusts) - a network of surface soil lichens, mosses, and cyanobacteria – that perform critical ecosystem functions, such as stabilizing soil and fixing carbon and nitrogen. Yet, our understanding of the role biocrusts play in dryland energy balance remains poor. Changes in climate can rapidly affect biocrust communities and we have long known that biocrusts respond dramatically to physical disturbance, such as human trampling and grazing animals. Associated changes in biocrust cover often result in increased bare soil; creating higher surface reflectance. We used spectral solar reflectance measurements in two manipulative experiments to compare the effects of climate and physical disturbance on biocrusts of the Colorado Plateau We measured reflectance at two heights: at crust surface and 1 m above. The climate disturbance site has four treatments: control, warming (4°C), altered precipitation, and warming plus altered precipitation. The physical disturbance site was trampled by foot annually since 1998. At the climate experiment, the largest change in reflectance was in the altered precipitation treatment (35% increase) at the surface-level, and the smallest difference was in the warmed (17% increase) at the meter-level. Physical disturbance differences were 10% at meter-level and 25% at surface-level. Unexpectedly, these results suggest that, via effects on biocrust communities, climate change could have a larger effect on dryland energy balance relative to physical disturbance, and result in more radiation from drylands returned to the atmosphere.

            "abstract": "Normal faulting, uplift and low convergent rates are observed in the Western Alps. Until recently, occurrence of normal faulting in weakly convergent mountain ranges has been attributed to the conversion of potential energy of the topography into seismic motion in the upper crust and viscous flow in the lower crust. However, recent insights indicate that gravitational mountain collapse may not be the only process responsible for extension in the core of mountain belts: -1. Leveling and vertical GPS measurements show that the elevated topography of the western and central Alps is currently uplifted at rates of 1-2 mm/yr while gravitational collapse would lead to a downward motion; -2. There is no correlation between mountain core extension and average mountain topography. Champagnac et al. (2009) have proposed an elastic plate model in which present-day uplift in the Alps occurs in response to mountain scale unloading by denudation. Following this first approach, we have developed a numerical model that demonstrates a causal link between topography denudation, crustal uplift and extensional strain in an alpine-type mountain belt (Vernant et al. 2013). A key aspect of the seismotectonic field observations in the Alps is that seismic strain and geodetic uplift are occurring in relatively narrow areas, while our mechanical model predicts a broader uplift. Also, geodetic uplift rates appear to be larger than the maximum value associated to Holocene denudation rates. Using a 2D Finite Element Modeling, we explore the possibility that localized uplift may be associated to re-activation of pre-existing tectonic structures. These weak zones are accounted for using low frictional faults and/or low viscosity zones. We also investigate the possibility that large uplift rates may partly contain a rebound associated to Holocene deglaciations cycle.",

            "abstract": "Following an intense deforestation process initiated in the 1960s, clear-cut deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have decreased significantly since 2004. A convergence of conditions contributed to this, including the creation of protected areas, the use of effective monitoring and control systems, and credit restriction mechanisms. Although regional social indicators have also slightly improved, society remains unequal and violent, both in urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the combined results of the fall of deforestation and the increased economic importance of the agribusiness sector have led to the political weakening of the so-called socio-environmental model. Thus, the current situation indicates a future of low (clear-cut) carbon emissions and low social conditions. On the other hand, other threats remain, including forest degradation derived from illegal logging and forest fires. There is also considerable uncertainty about the fate of the remaining forest areas as multiple forces can contribute to the return of high deforestation, including the rapidly expanding global markets for agricultural commodities, large-scale transportation and energy infrastructure projects, and weak institutions. We present the results of a participatory scenario process, in which we discussed the future of the region until 2050 combining normative and exploratory approaches. We include an ideal “Sustainability” scenario (Scenario A) in which we envision major socioeconomic, institutional and environmental achievements. Scenario B stays in the “Middle of the road”, in which the society maintains some of the positive environmental trends of the last decade, but not reversing the structural situation of social inequities. Scenario C is a pessimistic vision, named “Fragmentation” with high deforestation rates and low social development. The goal of the work was twofold: (a) to propose a method to enrich the discussion among different private and governmental stakeholders on how to build a trajectory towards sustainability; (b) to support the parameterization of spatially-explicit LUCC models in the scope of the AMAZALERT project.",

            "abstract": "Recent numerical modelling demonstrates that when sandy coastlines are affected predominantly by waves approaching from “high” angles (> ~45° between the coastline and wave crests at the offshore limit of shore-parallel contours), large-scale (kms to 100 kms) morphodynamic instabilities and finite-amplitude interactions can lead to the emergence of striking coastline features, including sand waves, capes and spits. The type of feature that emerges depends on the wave climate, defined as the angular distribution of wave influences on alongshore sediment transport. Under a constant wave climate, coastline morphology reaches a dynamical steady state; the cross-shore/alongshore aspect ratio and the general appearance of the features remains constant. In previous modelling involving wave-climate change, as well as comparisons between observed coastline morphologies and wave climates, it has been implicitly assumed that the morphology adjusts in a quasi-equilibrium fashion, so that at any time the coastline shape reflects the current forcing.\nHowever, here we present new model results showing pronounced path dependence in coastline morphodynamics. In experiments with a period of constant wave climate followed by a period of transition to a new wave climate and then a run-on phase, the features that exist during the run-on phase can be qualitatively and quantitatively different from those that would develop initially under the final wave climate. Although the features inherited from the past wave-climate history may in some case be true alternate stable states, in other cases the inherited features gradually decay toward the morphology that would be expected given the final wave climate. A suite of such experiments allows us to characterize how the e-folding timescale of this decay depends on 1) the initial wave climate, 2) the path through wave-climate space, and 3) the rate of transition. When the initial features are flying spits with cross-shore amplitudes of 6 – 8 km, e-folding times can be on the order of millennia or longer. These results could provide a new perspective when interpreting current and past coastline features. In addition, the complex paleo-coastline structure that develops in the coastal hinterlands in these experiments could be relevant to the structures observed in some coastal environments.",

These unique observations reveal that Titan’s interaction with the solar wind is in many ways similar to unmagnetized planets Mars and Venus in spite of the differences in the properties of the solar plasma in the outer solar system. In particular, Cassini detected a collisionless, supercritical bow shock under ongoing reformation and a well-defined induced magnetosphere filled with mass-loaded interplanetary magnetic field lines, which drape around Titan’s ionosphere. A study of pressure balance across different plasma regions suggest the presence of fossil fields similar to those detected during T32.

It has collected a unique altimetry dataset with higher spatial resolution and a better coverage of Arctic sea ice than any previous radar altimeter mission. The along-track sharpened footprint allows resolving fine-scale features of the ice pack and the examination of retrievable information from the SAR waveforms is a field of ongoing research. Different methods can be applied to CryoSat-2 data: threshold retrackers that use the leading edge; or fitted forward models, which are applied to full waveforms. The uncertainty of these methods propagates into the uncertainty of the final sea-ice thickness estimate via the freeboard to thickness conversion. Theoretical considerations show that the magnitude of uncertainties in the radar retracking may be a major if not dominating contribution to the uncertainty budget of sea-ice thickness retrieval from CryoSat-2.\nWe present a break-down of the uncertainty budget of CryoSat-2 Arctic sea-ice thickness of the threshold retracker based sea-ice thickness data product of the Alfred Wegener Institute. We discuss the differences in the radar waveform properties and the identification of leads in first-year and multi-year ice covered areas with the aim to mitigate ice type dependent biases. Though threshold retrackers are prone to a simplistic interpretation of the SAR waveforms we investigate the potential of this fast and robust method to retrieve additional physical properties at the sea ice surface.",

            "abstract": "The formation and cycling of reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere has important implications for air quality and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Snowpack NO3- photolysis provides a source of oxidants (e.g. OH, O3) and oxidant precursors (e.g. NOx) to the overlying boundary layer in remote, snow-covered regions. We have developed a parameterization for calculating the depth dependence of actinic flux in snowpack, and have incorporated it into a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. We use the model to estimate the flux and redistribution of nitrogen in Antarctic and Greenland snowpacks due to snow NO3- photolysis, and examine the implications for ice core NO3- concentration and isotope observations. The modeled potential flux of NOx from Antarctic snow (3-8x108 molec cm-2 s-1) and e-folding depths of ultraviolet actinic flux (26-80 cm) are comparable to observations. Antarctic boundary layer total nitrate (HNO3+NO3-), NOx, and OH concentrations are increased by an order of magnitude and boundary layer O3 concentrations are roughly doubled when snowpack photodenitrification is included in GEOS-Chem. The model-calculated nitrogen recycling factor (NRF) suggests that NO3- is recycled multiple times per year over the majority of the Antarctic continent. NO3- remains in the snow photolytic zone for at least 0.65 to 24 years, and depends on the snow accumulation rate. GEOS-Chem is also used to compare primary deposition of NO3- to the snow surface originating from long-range transport (FPRI), the re-deposition of photo-produced NOx to the snow surface (FPD), and the upward flux of NOx from the snow (FNOx) to examine nitrogen recycling and redistribution across Antarctica. FPD is larger than FPRI across much of Antarctica, suggesting large-scale redistribution of nitrogen across the entire continent. The utility of nitrogen isotopes measurements in Antarctic ice cores in assessing the degree of post-depositional processing across the Antarctic continent is also investigated.\nPreliminary results of the flux and redistribution of nitrogen in Greenland snowpacks due to snow NO3- photolysis and the implications for ice core NO3- concentration and isotope records in Greenland will also be presented.",

Simultaneous advances in remote earth observation and large-scale land-surface and hydrological modeling promise improvements in our ability to understand these linkages, and suggest that improvements in prediction of river flow and inundation extents may result. Here we present an analysis of newly-available observational estimates of surface water inundation obtained through satellite Earth observation with results from simulations produced by using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land-surface model operating at 0.5 degree resolution over the African continent. The model was forced with meteorological input from the WATCH Forcing Data for the period 1981-2001 and sensitivity to various model configurations and parameter settings were tested. Both the PDM and TOPMODEL sub-grid scale runoff generation schemes were tested for parameter sensitivities, with the evaluation focussing on simulated river discharge in sub-catchments of the Congo, Nile, Niger, Orange, Okavango and Zambezi rivers. It was found that whilst the water balance in each of the catchments can be simulated with acceptable accuracy, the individual responses of each river vary between model configurations so that there is no single runoff parameterization scheme or parameter values that yields optimal results across all catchments. We trace these differences to the model’s representation of sub-surface flow and make some suggestions to improve the performance of large-scale land-surface models for use in similar applications. Our findings also demonstrate links between episodes of extensive surface water flooding and large-scale climatic indices, although the pattern of correlations contains a level of spatial and temporal detail that warrants careful attention to the climatology of individual situations. These findings suggest that the use of Earth observation data together with improved models of large-scale hydrology have the potential to improve our ability to predict surface-water flooding and to develop our understanding of the role of flooding in driving components of the water and carbon cycles.",

OSIRIS measurements show two discrepancies, a post-eruption lag in aerosol onset/increase, and a low bias in maximum stratospheric aerosol optical depth. Assumed robustness of the OSIRIS data drove various conclusions, some controversial, such as the contention that the June 2011 Nabro plume was strictly tropospheric, and entered the stratosphere indirectly via the Asian monsoon. Those conclusions were driven by OSIRIS data and a Smithsonian Institution report of strictly tropospheric injection heights. We address the issue of Nabro’s eruption chronology and injection height, and the reasons for the OSIRIS aerosol discrepancies.\nWe lay out the time line of Nabro injection height with geostationary image data, and stratospheric plume evolution after eruption onset using retrievals of sulfur dioxide and sulfate aerosol. The observations show that Nabro injected sulfur directly into the stratosphere upon the initial eruption on 12/13 June, and again on 16 June 2011. Next, OSIRIS data are examined for non-volcanic and volcanically perturbed conditions. In non-volcanic conditions OSIRIS profiles systematically terminate 1-4 km above the tropopause. Additionally, OSIRIS profiles terminate when 750 nm aerosol extinction exceeds ~0.0025 km-1, a level that is commonly exceeded after volcanic injections.\nOur findings largely resolve the discrepancies in published works involving OSIRIS aerosol data and offer a correction to the Nabro injection-height and eruption chronology.",

However, the effects of injection and production on fault stability in real fields are not always intuitively obvious, and require the development of new-generation coupled flow-geomechanical models that capture the effect of multiphase poromechanics on faults. We study, by way of numerical modeling and simulation, the potential for induced seismicity at the Cavone field. Using a coupled flow and geomechanics model of the field that honors reservoir geology and historical well schedule, we simulate oil production and water injection in the field for a period of three decades leading up to the earthquake sequence. We calculate the change in Coulomb stress on the bounding Mirandola fault, which sourced the May 29, 2012 M 5.8 earthquake. This quantity varies in space and evolves in time with changing pore pressure and total stress in the reservoir. A novel and important aspect of our work is the identification of a potential instability mechanism for a bounding fault at the edge of a reservoir experiencing pressure depletion. The discontinuity in pore pressure across the fault means that there is a discontinuity in effective normal stress and that, therefore, the Coulomb failure criterion must be evaluated locally on both sides of the fault. We track the evolution of the Coulomb stress at the earthquake hypocenter and compare it with the regional tectonic stressing rate to conclude in favor of tectonic origin of the earthquake. In addition, analysis of the locations of aftershocks of the May 2012 sequence shows a lack of seismicity in the area where the stressing rates from contraction of the reservoir are largest. This observed lack of seismic activity within 1–2 km from the reservoir suggests that fluid production and injection from the Cavone field was not an important driver for the observed seismicity.",

We present the application of DES toward two case studies – basal crevasses and calving blocks – to illustrate the potential of the model to aid in understanding calving processes. Among the advantages of using DES are: its unstructured meshes which adaptively resolve zones of high interest; its use of multiple rheologies to simulate different types of dynamic behavior; and its explicit and parallel numerical core which both make the implementation of different boundary conditions easy and the model highly scalable.\nWe examine the initiation and development of both basal crevasses and calving blocks through time using visco-elasto-plastic rheology. Employing a brittle-to-ductile transition zone (BDTZ) based on local strain rate shows that the style and development of brittle features like crevasses differs markedly on the rheological parameters. Brittle and ductile behavior are captured by Mohr-Coulomb elastoplasticity and Maxwell viscoelasticity, respectively. We explore the parameter spaces which define these rheologies (including temperature) as well as the BDTZ threshold (shown in the literature as 10-7 Pa s), using time-to-failure as a metric for accuracy within the model. As the time it takes for a block of ice to fail can determine an iceberg’s size, this work has implications for calving laws.",

In one model, we use a stochastic trigger that initiates strong convection at a random time after the water vapor has reached a critical value. In the other, the trigger is deterministic and occurs immediately when a fixed threshold is reached. Also, the triggers are considered with either a single threshold for regime transitions or two distinct thresholds (allowing for hysteresis). These four cases are investigated in stochastic models of column water vapor dynamics. Two types of results are presented here. First, exact statistics are presented for all four models, and a comparison indicates how the trigger choice influences rainfall statistics. For example, it is shown that the average rainfall is identical for all four triggers, whereas extreme rainfall events are more likely with the stochastic trigger. Second, the stochastic triggers are shown to converge to the deterministic triggers in the limit of fast transition rates.",

            "abstract": "Detecting trend changes and outliers are common needs in applied time series analysis. Here we propose a tool combining various robust methods to perform simultaneously these two tasks. Such a unified tool is well adapted to the analysis of extensive databases. We use it to analyze ground deformations associated to volcanic activity in the Virunga Volcanic Province. Trend changes are estimated using weighted moving average filter, locally weighted scatterplot smoothers and smoothing splines. Significance of detected trend changes is estimated using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests such as Mann-Kendall, Spearmans Rho and Pearson correlation methods. Outliers are detected using both standardized residuals from best-fit model and Chebyshev’s inequality. On one side observations that have a studentized residual outside the ± 2 range are considered statistically significant at the 95% a level and potential outliers. On the other hand Chebyshev’s inequality gives a bound of what percentage of the data falls outside of k standard deviations from the mean calculating upper and lower outlier detection limits. When multiple components of displacements are available (such as vertical, North-South and East-West GPS time series), the outliers detection is performed on each component separately, then jointly. The effectiveness of the tool is demonstrated by analyzing 5 years of data recorded by the permanent GNSS volcano monitoring network in Goma as well as the extensive amount of MSBAS Multidimensional InSAR time series (Samsonov and dOreye, 2012) recorded in the Virunga during 2003-2013 time period.",

This self-aggregation is linked to feedbacks between radiation, surface fluxes, and convection, and the organization is intimately related to the evolution of the column water vapor (CWV) field. To investigate the relevance of this behavior to the real world, these idealized simulations are compared with five 15-day cases of real organized convection in the tropics, including multiple simulations of each case testing sensitivities of the convective organization and mean states to interactive radiation, interactive surface fluxes, and evaporation of rain. Despite similar large-scale forcing via lateral boundary conditions, systematic differences in mean CWV, CWV distribution shape, and the length scale of CWV features are found between the different sensitivity runs, showing that there are at least some similarities in sensitivities to these feedbacks in both idealized and realistic simulations.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a two-dimensional, finite element code that solves the electromagnetic full wave equations in global magnetospheric geometry. The code produces the three-dimensional wave structure, including mode conversion effects, for plasma waves launched in a two-dimensional axisymmetric background plasma with general magnetic field topology. Using this code, we have examined how EMIC waves are generated and propagated along the magnetic field line. While left-handed polarized EMIC waves are known to be excited by the cyclotron instability associated with hot and anisotropic ion distributions in the equatorial region of the magnetosphere, the generation mechanism of linear and right-handed polarized EMIC waves, which are often observed near the magnetic equator, remains as one of the unsolved scientific questions. In this presentation, we show the linear polarization of the EMIC waves can be explained by mode conversion at the ion-ion hybrid (IIH) resonance (an analogue of the field-line resonance when the resonance frequency is on the order of the heavy ion cyclotron frequency) when externally driven compressional waves propagate into an increasing/decreasing heavy ion concentration or inhomogeneous magnetic field. Since these mode-converted waves depend sensitively on the heavy ion concentration, it possible to estimate the heavy ion concentration ratio from the wave propagation characteristics. We also evaluated the absorption coefficients at the IIH resonance at Earth’s geosynchronous orbit for variable concentrations of He+ and wave frequencies and have found that the resonance only occurs for a limited range of wave frequencies, defined such that the IIH resonance frequency is close to, but not exactly the same as the crossover frequency. Using the wave absorption and observed EMIC waves from the GOES-12 satellite, we demonstrate how this technique can be used to estimate that the He+ concentration is around 4% near L = 6.6.",

New measurements of methane in cities suggest an as-yet unrealized potential for city-scale methane mitigation. We present high-resolution methane observations from four cities in North America to demonstrate the utility of methane surveys for identifying urban methane sources. We used portable, continuous on-road measurements to determine the spatial distribution of methane in Fairbanks, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and San Diego. Across cities, methane tended to be highly concentrated in space, suggesting discrete, point emission sources. Elevated methane levels were found near known emission sources, such as landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and natural gas-fueled power plants, and revealed the location of fugitive leaks in natural gas infrastructure. The mix of sources and sizes of methane leaks varied among cities, highlighting a need for locally adaptive emissions regulation. Urban methane observations can inform anthropogenic processes in development of methane mitigation strategies. We discuss specific examples of how continuous atmospheric measurements can enhance the design of mitigation strategies in these cities, and potential contributions of these approaches to cross-sectoral efforts to reduce methane emissions at the city level.",

            "abstract": "During the Anthropocene, humans have had a substantial impact on fluvial systems throughout the world. Perhaps nowhere is the human imprint on stream systems more pronounced than in the intensively managed agriculture landscapes of the midwestern United States. This study examines changes in the structure of the stream network and in the planform dynamics of stream channels within the upper Sangamon River basin in Illinois – a watershed that is part of a new Critical Zone Observatory focusing on intensively managed landscapes (IML-CZO). The research explores changes in network structure as the landscape changed from prairie and forest into drained farmland dominated by row crop agriculture. It also documents the planform dynamics of stream and river channels over the past 80 to 100 years. Results show that the spatial extent of channels within the stream network expanded greatly as land was cleared and drained for agriculture. Expansion of the network into headwater portions of the watershed occurred through the construction of drainage ditches that serve as outlets for tile drainage systems underlying relatively flat, poorly drained farmland. Analysis of planform dynamics reveals that most of these drainage ditches have not changed alignment since initial construction. Although drainage ditches are maintained by local drainage districts, these human-created channels also are remarkably resistant to change in planform over time. The major type of planform change in headwater streams involves artificial straightening of meandering channels to expand the extent of drainage channels. Many sections of the meandering Sangamon River are heavily forested and exhibit little or no planform change over the past 80-100 years. Sections that are most active tend to occur where forest cover is less prevalent due to clearing of trees for pasture or cropland. Overall, the results demonstrate the pronounced imprint of humans on the structure and planform dynamics of a fluvial system in an intensively managed watershed. Undoubtedly this imprint has an important influence on downstream fluxes of water, nutrients, and sediment, which are a primary focus of ongoing process-based research in the IML-CZO.",

Site U1357 is located in the Adélie Trough, a glacially scoured valley on the continental shelf ~50km off the coast of East Antarctica. Sediment samples were taken at 10cm intervals resulting in an approximate time step for each sample of 7yr resolution based on extensive C14 dating and visible band counting exercises. As part of a collaborative effort between Queens College and Stanford University, samples from the upper part of the core were used in this study, which spanned from near Recent to 6kyr BP. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma make up nearly 50% of all foraminifers counted and was used to construct pelagic stable isotope records. From nearly 10,000 foraminifers counted, ~34 foraminiferal species were identified.\nThe highest δ18O values occur from ~3.0 to ~6.1kyr and ~1kyr to Recent, with the lowest occurring from ~1.4 to ~3.8kyr. The highest δ13C values occur when δ18O are low. Total benthic foraminiferal abundances are highest during two intervals: Recent to ~1.4kyr and ~3.6 to ~6.1kyr. For ~2 to ~3.6kyr, the agglutinated species are the most dominant with calcareous benthic foraminifers being mainly absent.\nThe higher δ18O values observed are consistent with lower surface water temperatures and decreased melt water from icebergs, with lower δ18O values ascribed to increased melt waters and possibly higher surface water temperatures. Previous studies indicate that cooler waters occurred when we observe lower foraminiferal δ18O values. This suggests that the N. pachyderma δ18O record was influenced primarily by the δ18O of seawater (e.g., iceberg melt waters), with temperature being a minor control. Higher δ13C values are associated with lower δ18O, which implies increased water column stratification coupled with high productivity possibly owing to less sea ice. This increase in stratification is associated with the absence of calcareous benthic forms, which is interpreted to be due to decreased bottom-water ventilation.",

Consideration of the integrated system is necessary to fully understand the individual risk profile of each sector. In defining vulnerabilities and potential adaptations, the policy and regulatory environment must be considered alongside the biological and physical systems. Take, for example, the Southwestern U.S., a naturally arid system, where water availability is declining as a consequence of climate change and population growth. Adaptations by the water sector to convey, store, and develop new water sources (e.g. desalination, groundwater pumping, water-reuse) are strategies designed to enhance sustainability of the sector. But, the energy requirements embedded in these management techniques pose challenges to electric utilities. West wide, approximately 20% of total electricity generation goes toward supplying and heating water. If future investments made by the water sector to deal with changing supply and demand regimes continue to follow current trends, the dependence of water on energy availability will grow, meaning that the water supply will be increasingly reliant on the electricity system. Here, we use the example of long-term aridity and the recent drought in the Western US to illustrate the tradeoffs and challenges inherent at the nexus between energy and water. We present long-term trends in the energy intensity of water supplies in the Southwestern US, with a specific focus on groundwater systems. Projected energy requirements for proposed and future conveyance systems are discussed. The potential impacts of reduced flows on the Colorado River on the energy demands for groundwater pumping in the Lower Colorado River Basin are highlighted.",

            "abstract": "Past seismic imaging studies of the Isabella anomaly in Southern California lacked resolution to distinguish between the two dominating hypotheses for its origin: a fossil slab origin or a foundering lithospheric root of the Sierra Nevada volcanic arc. To definitively distinguish the origin of the anomaly as one, or neither, of these possibilities is important in the understanding of the evolution of continental arcs and the process of subduction termination. To do this, we deployed an array of 44 broadband seismometers from the Isabella anomaly to the coast at latitude 36°N, starting in December 2013. The array has a station spacing of ~7 km spacing filling a gap between the southern and northern California permanent seismic networks (NCSN and SCSN). The array will continue to collect data until summer 2015. We will present preliminary surface wave tomography results using empirical interstation green's functions derived from ambient seismic noise recorded by more than 500 stations that currently or previously surround our array. Initial Ps receiver function images from common conversion point stacking will also be presented. We also use local earthquakes to model the shape and velocity of the Central Valley, as this will be important in correcting the tomography and receiver function images.We also deployed a dense array of short period stations in Peachtree Valley, where the broadband array crossed the San Andreas Fault (SAF). This network will be used to determine the location and level of seismicity on a segment of the SAF where it is creeping.This first batch of results from our broadband seismic experiment should provide new insight into how far the basaltic crust of the Monterey microplate extends inland beneath California and whether the Isabella anomaly is connected to North America or Pacific lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "In Lake Chad basin, the Quaternary phreatic Aquifer (named hereafter QPA) presents large piezometric anomalies referred as domes and depressions. Depths of these piezometric anomalies are ~15 m and ~60 m, respectively [1]. Leblanc et al., (2003) discovered that brightness temperatures from METEOSAT infrared images of the Lake Chad basin show a correlation with the QPA piezometry. Indeed, during wet seasons, domes are associated with warm brightness temperatures, at the contrary of the depressions, which appear cold in METEOSAT images. Through this observation, these authors [2] proposed that this thermal behaviour results from an excess of evapotranspiration that can also explain the formation of the piezometric anomalies. However, data provided by temperature logs in oil wells lead us to propose another hypothesis.\nTemperature logs obtained in oil wells [3] illustrate that in the ancient Lake Chad and in the Bornou depression, at the SW of the Lake, heat transport is made by convection in the ~3 km deep confined aquifers. Moreover, we have estimated that the heat fluxes at the surface of the ancient Lake Chad can reach 138 mW m-2 and in the Bornou depression, ~63 mW m-2. Others oil wells show that, at the exterior of the depression, the heat transport is conductive and the heat fluxes at the surface are ~50 mW m-2. These new observations permit us to propose that beneath the depressions, a cold and salty descending convective current suck the QPA. Beneath the dome, a warm and less salty ascending current creates an overpressure in the QPA. Now, to explain the link observed with the thermal behaviour, we propose that over the domes, as the QPA is warm, water can rises by capillarity. The piezometric depressions regions are associated with a presence of clay-rich soils at the surface, which makes difficult the exchange between the QPA and the atmosphere. However, we have discovered some giant dessication cracks that can facilitate the exchanges by increasing the vertical permeability of the clay cap horizon. These facts eventually explain the correlation between the observed brightness temperatures and the piezometric anomalies.\n[1] Schneider (1966), Carte hydrogéologique au 1/500 000, B.R.G.M.

            "abstract": "The Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB, South Africa) is one of the few Archean remnants where the tectonic evolution of the Early Earth can be studied. The first formation of the crust is a controversially discussed topic among geoscientists. Tectonics on the Early Earth might have been similar to the plate movement and their driving forces that we observe today. However, regarding that some fundamental conditions like the thermal setting were considerably different at this time other processes like vertical mass transport might have played the governing role in tectonics.\nTherefore contrasting evolutionary models of the BGB exist, mainly based on a number of geological and petrological studies. However, there is only little information on its deeper architecture. For a better understanding of past processes and the character of the tectonic regime which led to the formation of the BGB, magnetotelluric (MT) surveys were carried out as a part of the German-South African Inkaba yeAfrica research initiative. At approximately 200 MT sites aligned along six profiles (approx. 80 to 110 km length) data was collected during two field experiments in 2009 and 2010.\nThe MT method images the electrical conductivity of rocks and is particularly sensitive to imprints of tectonic processes resulting in persistent mineralization e.g. along shear planes.\nAgainst the surrounding of significantly conductive geological units like the Phanerozoic Transvaal cover, the rocks of the BGB are generally characterized by high electrical resistivities. Particularly plutons such as the Dalmein Pluton can be traced deeply into the crust. Contrary, faults of the BGB appear as zones of high conductivity down to a depth of 5 to 10 km. We will present 3D inversion results indicating an extension of the plutons of the western BGB beneath the Transvaal cover and a sharp conductivity contrast of the BGB compared to the eastern batholiths. We will discuss existing models of the evolution of the BGB in view of our 3D electrical conductivity images.",

            "abstract": "A case study was performed at a former industrial site in the Santa Susana Mountains in Canoga Park, California in order to observe discontinuities such as faults and fractures that potentially affect groundwater flow and contaminant transport within the study area. The active multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) was performed using a landstreamer and weight drop source along a service road spanning approximately 1.4 miles. From previous geologic investigations, it is assumed that at least two faults cross the seismic profile and that one end of the profile is within a shear zone. The subsurface is composed of brittle to competent sandstone with intermittent shale beds that make up the Chatsworth Formation. Collected data were used to construct 2-D shear-wave velocity profiles and for backscatter analyses. Noise tests from an additional reflection survey along the same road was used as passive MASW to supplement the active data where low frequency data was absent. The goal of this case study is to observe the presence and orientation faults and fractures that could not be determined from surface mapping or downhole geophysical logging.\nHigher mode surface waves contaminated much of the data providing evidence of the complex geologic structure potentially caused by an abundance of faults, fractures, and changing topography throughout the profile. The passive MASW provided low frequency dispersion information which helped dispersion curve picking where the active data was not sufficient. The backscatter analyses observed several events that coincided with geologic features seen in the MASW results as well as in areas where the higher mode contamination was too great for MASW analysis.\nAs a result, the combination of active MASW, passive MASW, and backscatter analyses provided velocity information at depths to 30 m. Several discontinuities were observed in the velocity profiles and backscatter analyses. These low velocity features may provide information regarding the presence and orientation of faults and fractures after further investigation. Only 51% of the stations were used for characterizing the subsurface before the signal-to-noise ratio and the risk of artifacts and aliasing in the data became too great for extracting reliable results.",

            "abstract": "Various records across the Paleocene – Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have established approximately 5 °C of additional surface and deep ocean warming, superimposed on the already warm latest Paleocene. The PETM is further characterized by a global negative stable carbon isotope excursion (CIE), poleward migration of thermophilic biota, ocean acidification, increased weathering, photic zone euxinia and intensified hydrological cycle. Reconstructed temperatures for the PETM in mid and high-latitudes regularly exceed modern open marine tropical temperatures. Constraints on absolute tropical temperatures are, however, limited.\nWe studied the PETM in a sediment section from the Nigerian sector of the Dahomey Basin, deposited on the shelf near the equator. We estimate sea surface temperatures by paired analyses of TEX86, and Mg/Ca and δ18O of foraminifera from the Shagamu Quarry. These show Palaeocene temperatures of ~33 °C and SSTs rose by 4 °C during the PETM based on TEX86. During the PETM, intermittent photic zone euxinia developed based on the presence of the biomarker isorenieratane. Interestingly, during peak warmth, dinoflagellate cyst abundances and diversity are remarkably low.\nFrom our new data and evidence from modern dinoflagellate experiments, we conclude that thermal stress was the main driver for this observation. We derive that endothermal and most ectothermal nektonic and planktonic marine eukaryotic organisms could not have lived in the surface waters in this part of the tropics during the PETM.",

            "abstract": "It is one of the great challenges in seismology to resolve spatially varying crustal anisotropy, and body waves that undergo P-to-S conversion at the crust-mantle boundary provide the best sampling. Since such phases arrive within the P wave coda, they are identified using receiver functions. Sophisticated techniques have been developed to migrate or to invert receiver functions for crustal structure, however, crustal anisotropic properties are hardly investigated. Most of the receiver function studies targeting crustal anisotropy use forward modeling approaches that demand examination of several tens of thousand of models, which becomes daunting.\nWe have developed a technique to explore detailed anisotropic nature of the crust from splitting analysis of teleseismic receiver functions. Unlike the conventional methods, we consider crust as a transversely isotropic medium with tilted (not horizontal) symmetry axis and modify the cross-convolution method accordingly. For each station, our approach seeks the optimal set of fast polarization azimuth, tilt of the symmetry axis, dip of the Moho discontinuity, and measure of anisotropic strength by analyzing data from multiple sources simultaneously.\nWe test our approach using ray-theoretical synthetic seismograms generated by the RAYSUM algorithm. Estimated parameters are usually in good agreement with the input, however, the most robustly estimated value is always the fast splitting direction. Besides synthetics, we also applied our technique to the recordings of the ANZA network stations that are locate in southern California. Every station in this network shows significant amount of energy on the transverse component receiver functions indicating the presence of crustal anisotropy or dipping interface. In addition to lateral variations in fast polarization direction across this array, we also present our preliminary results for the neighboring states. At some stations, we detect converted energy from a strong mid-crustal interface with polarity reversals on transverse component, which implies the presence of multiple anisotropic layers within the crust. The new approach can be applied for studying multi-layered anisotropy, and provides a unique opportunity for investigating depth-varying crustal anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "Stishovite is stable at 9~50GPa and further transformed into CaCl2-type silica. It is estimated that stishovite makes up more than 20% of the subducted oceanic crust in the mantle transition zone and lower mantle. Therefore, the properties of stishovite and its polymorph are critical for us to understand the mantle convection. We calculated the elastic constants of stishovite and CaCl2-type silica at high-temperature and -pressure using the new method developed by Wu and Wentzcovitch [1], which requires only tenth of computational time of the conventional first principles method. The elastic properties of stishovite show not only strong pressure dependence but also temperature dependence. By increasing temperature, the shear instability of stishovite is shifted to an elevated pressure with a slope of ~5.4±1.4 MPa/K. The softening of the shear modulus and the positive Clapeyron slope result in crossing of the sound velocities at different temperatures, which leads to the unusual positive temperature dependence of the sound velocities around the phase boundary. The transition from stishovite to the CaCl2-type silica at the lower mantle’s temperature occurs at a depth far deeper than 1200 km and is accompanied by a velocity jump ~ 0.98±0.08 km/s in S wave velocity (VS)  and ~ 0.45±0.15 km/s in P wave velocity (VP). This transition is likely related to the seismic discontinuity at the depth ~1670 km in the vicinity of Mariana Island. The unusual positive temperature dependence of VS of stishovite and strong anisotropy of stishovite and the CaCl2-type silica around the phase boundary provide potential ways to identify the origin of the seismic discontinuity [2].\n[1].

            "abstract": "Mineral aerosols are an increasingly important component of the climate system that affect the radiative budget, nutrient cycles, and human environments. Dust emissions are largely controlled by regional climate factors such as atmospheric stability, precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation. Regional climates, particularly within the tropics, are affected by teleconnections excited by sea surface temperatures. We therefore explore the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly patterns on local climates in major dust source regions (including southern Africa, the Arabian Desert, the Lake Eyre basin, and three others in North Africa) to help understand variability in the global dust cycle. We investigate the sensitivity of regional climate variables impacting mineral aerosol emissions to global SST anomaly patterns by estimating the global teleconnection operator (GTO), which relates regional climate responses to SST anomaly patterns. We estimate the GTO using the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5.0 (CAM5.0) forced by an ensemble of randomly perturbed climatological SST fields.\nVariability in dust emissions are connected to SST anomaly patterns in the tropical oceans, particularly in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Teleconnections excited by remote SST anomalies typically modify dust emissions via near-surface circulation changes that impact friction velocity. However, the impact of SST-driven changes on threshold friction velocity can be on the same order of magnitude as those of friction velocity, suggesting the impact of SST anomalies on surface conditions are also significant. We reconstruct historical climates using the GTO and compare the results to a non-linear model and observations to assess the GTO capabilities and to identify ocean basins with the strongest influence on major dust source regions. Recognizing SST anomaly patterns as a component of internal variability in regional dust emissions helps characterize the impact of human influences on the dust cycle as well as improve predictions of dust and their climate impacts.",

            "abstract": "Daily station records and output from the MERRA atmospheric reanalysis are used to examine the characteristics of extreme daily precipitation events in Spitzbergen. Spitzbergen is the largest island of the Svalbard Archipelago, located between about 77-79oN in the northern North Atlantic. The region is frequently influenced by strong extratropical cyclones associated with the North Atlantic Cyclone track and (in winter) pronounced regional baroclinicity due to proximity to the sea ice margin. Despite the stronger cyclone activity in winter, extreme daily precipitation events, defined as those of at least 25 mm, can occur year round. Based on composite analysis, the average pattern associated with extremes has the island influenced by a strong trough of low sea level pressure extending from the southwest, unusually strong southerly winds in troposphere, positive anomalies in precipitable water and pronounced upward motion (negative omega) at 500 hPa. This is linked aloft to positive anomalies in 500 hPa height over the Barents Sea and negative anomalies over Greenland. The mean pattern for summer-only events is similar. While individual extreme events do not share all of these characteristics, strong southerly flow and positive anomalies in precipitable water provide a near common thread. Several of the largest precipitation events can be associated with “atmospheric rivers” seen as narrow corridors of strong positive anomalies in precipitable water extending thousands of kilometers south into the subtropical Atlantic. Reflecting local topography, large precipitation events at one of the Spitsbergen sites are typically not well represented at others, a notable exception being the two-day event of 29-30 January, 2012, which appears to be clearly linked to an atmospheric river and is examined as a case study.",

            "abstract": "In this work we use GPS data to study the postseismic viscoelastic relaxation related to the MW 6.3 normal faulting earthquake that struck the city of L'Aquila (Central Apennines, Italy) on April 6, 2009. Only a limited number of normal-faulting earthquakes have geodetic measurements of viscoelastic relaxation and there is limited knowledge of the viscosity structure of the lower crust/upper mantle in the Central Appennines. Since this region is currently experiencing active extension that gives rise to normal-faulting seismicity, the estimation of the typical relaxation time of the region is of great interest for interseismic strain-rate estimations and to better understand how extension is accommodated beneath the upper seismogenic crust. GPS data are processed by using GIPSY/OASIS software. Particular care has been taken to estimate and correct for the interseismic deformation and the early afterslip deformation, well documented by GPS and InSAR (D’Agostino et al., 2012). A particularly interesting signal observed in the time series is related to hydrological loading with seasonal and multi-annual periodicities. Here we present the preliminary results of the comparison between about 5 years of postseismic deformation recorded at permanent GPS stations, and the surface deformation expected running different viscoelastic models in order to estimate best-fit rheological parameters. Forward models are generated by means of the PSCMP/PSGRN code (Wang et al. 2006). Preliminary results will be presented and possible implications for the mechanism of active crustal extension in general and of the Apennines in particular, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The effect of temperature on maize yield has generally been considered using a single value for the entire growing season. We compare the effect of temperature trends on yield between two distinct models: a single temperature sensitivity for the whole season and a variable sensitivity across four distinct agronomic development stages. The more resolved variable-sensitivity model indicates roughly a factor of two greater influence of temperature on yield than that implied by the single-sensitivity model. The largest discrepancies occur in silking, which is demonstrated to be the most sensitive stage in the variable-sensitivity model. For instance, whereas median yields are observed to be only 53% of typical values during the hottest 1% of silking-stage temperatures, the single-sensitivity model over predicts median yields of 68% whereas the variable-sensitivity model more correctly predicts median yields of 61%. That the variable sensitivity model is also not capable of capturing the full extent of yield losses suggests that further refinement to represent the non-linear response would be useful. Results from the variable sensitivity model also indicate that management decisions regarding planting times, which have generally shifted toward earlier dates, have led to greater yield benefit than that implied by the single-sensitivity model. Together, the variation of both temperature trends and yield variability within growing stages calls for closer attention to how changes in management interact with changes in climate to ultimately affect yields.",

            "abstract": "The climatology and variability of Shamal wind, an important regulator of summertime Middle Eastern dust storm activity, have been poorly characterized in the scientific literature. The Middle Eastern Shamal is a strong low-level northwesterly wind, which can lift dust from the Syrian and Iraqi deserts and transport it to the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula. Despite its critical role as a dust storm driver, the variability and controls of summertime Shamal wind has not been addressed by previous studies. The spatial distribution and seasonal cycle of the Shamal wind during 1970-2013, along with its interannual variability, covariability with dust storm activities, and potential link to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, are studied using hourly station records, reanalysis data, and remotely-sensed data. According to a wind-direction and speed-based criterion for Shamal days, the summertime Shamal behaves like a summer monsoon with variability in its onset, termination, and distinct break periods. Based on a multi-station criterion for Shamal onset and termination, the onset occurs on May 23 ± 8 days (one standard deviation), and the termination date is Sep 2 ± 21 days. The highest wind speed on a Shamal day occurs around the noon along the west coast of the Persian Gulf, corresponding to a peak in horizontal pressure gradient. The onset of Shamal is associated with the development of low pressure over Iran and high pressure over the eastern Mediterranean and northwestern Arabian Peninsula - an eastward expansion of the high over subtropical Atlantic. El Niño events support the delayed onset and weaker intensity of the summer Shamal. Intensified summer Shamal winds are associated with anomalously cool Mediterranean SSTs, which enhance the high pressure over the eastern Mediterranean. The impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Mediterranean SSTs on summer Shamal are validated by an independent statistical method, the General Equilibrium Feedback Assessment. Periods of enhanced Shamal wind intensity favor increased summertime floating dust frequency (temporal correlation = 0.77,1975-2013), dust storm frequency (temporal correlation = 0.57, 1975-2013), and aerosol optical depth (temporal correlation = 0.73, 2000-2013).",

Recent studies of vesicle population properties within MORB samples suggest a similar correlation between spreading rate and magma ascent rate. This study examines dissolved CO2 and H2O analyses in MORB glasses from a comprehensive sample suite – compiled from the literature (n = 300) and from new measurements (n = 100) – spanning nearly the full range of spreading rates to investigate patterns in supersaturation. We find that samples from ridges with spreading rates <6 mm yr-1 show a distinctly different population of supersaturations and indicate a fundamental change in magma ascent rate and degassing. We explore the proposed mechanisms that control magma ascent and decompression rates in these systems including viscosity variations, tectonic stress variations, and dynamic decompression of melt reservoirs. Our results suggest that variation in ascent path length, controlled by the thermal structure of the ridge most likely exerts a first-order control on magma dynamics and hence degassing in these systems. We use these results to examine variations in the extent of degassing across the global mid-ocean ridge as a means to refine predictions of CO2 flux.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s mantle connects the atmosphere with the deep interior through convection thus setting up a gradient of oxidation: currently the atmosphere is ~20% oxygen, while the core is mostly metallic iron. As the atmosphere has changed composition throughout Earth history, the redox evolution has proven to be critical to Earth’s evolution and the origin of life. Despite its importance, the redox state of Earth’s mantle is largely an enigma and its effect on composition, phase relations and the physicochemical properties of the mantle phases is controversial. It is expected that oxygen fugacity of the mantle decreases with increasing depth. However, some experiments show an increase in the ferric iron (Fe3+) concentration in Mg-silicate perovskite (bridgmanite)—the most abundant mineral in the Earth—with accompanying metallic Fe, and suggest that the trend in iron oxidation state is opposite. In this study, we take two samples of nearly identical bulk composition [enstatite chondrite composition (Javoy, 1995: Mg/Si ~0.77, Fe/Si ~0.26)] that only differ in the relative abundance of Fe3+ to the same synthesis conditions in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC). We find that despite similar starting bulk compositions and synthesis conditions (lower mantle conditions: ~30-90 GPa, 1900-2300 K), different assemblages are synthesized due to differing ferric iron content. For a more reduced (lower Fe3+/ΣFe) composition, we find Al2O3 forms its own phase separate from the dominant Mg-silicate perovskite phase, in contrast to a more Al-rich Mg-silicate perovskite-dominated assemblage for a more oxidized starting composition. The density of the reduced composition is found to be 1-1.5% denser than the more oxidized sample. This implies that as a single composition is taken deeper in to the mantle, where it is more reducing, may become denser than if the redox state remained constant. This redox-induced density difference could potentially cause sluggish convection due to the increased density in Earth’s lower mantle and lead to a more oxidized upper mantle and more reduced lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "The ecosystem services concept is seen by many as a useful paradigm to support decision-making at the complex interface between science, policy and practice. However, to be successful, it requires a strong willingness for collaboration and joint understanding. In support of this aspiration, OPPLA is being developed as a web portal to enable European communities to better manage ecosystems for human well-being and livelihoods. OPPLA will provide access to a variety of online resources such as tools, case studies, lessons learned, videos, manuals and training and educational materials. It will also provide expert forums and spaces for discussions between researchers, practitioners and decision makers. Hence a critical aspect of the success of OPPLA is the co-evolution of communities of practice.\nAn example of a community of practice is the recently launched Ecosystem Services Community – Scotland (ESCom-Scotland; escomscotland.wordpress.com). ESCom-Scotland aims to support better management of Scotland’s natural resources by helping to establish a community of practice between individuals and groups involved in the science, policy and practice behind sustainable ecosystem management. It aspires to encourage the sharing of ideas, increase collaboration and to initiate a support network for those engaging with the ecosystem services concept and it will use the OPPLA resources to support these activities.\nOPPLA is currently at the developmental stage and was instigated by two large European Commission funded research projects: OPERAs (www.operas-project.eu) and OpenNESS (www.openness-project.eu), with a combined budget of ca. €24m. These projects aim to improve understanding of how ecosystem services contribute to human well-being in different social-ecological systems. Research will establish whether, how and under what conditions the ecosystem services concept can move beyond the academic domain towards practical implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. New insights, and improved or novel tools and instruments, will be tested in practice in case studies that cover a range of socio-ecological systems across locales, sectors, scales and time. This presentation will discuss the development of OPPLA and the communities of practice that are emerging around it.",

Most recently, this research has expanded our understanding not only of the deep biosphere but the deep hydrosphere – identifying for the first time the extreme antiquity (millions to billions of years residence time) of deep saline fracture waters in the world’s oldest rocks. Energy-rich saline fracture waters in the Precambrian crust that makes up more than 70% of the Earth’s continental lithosphereprovide important constraints on our understanding of the extent of the crust that is habitable, on the time scales of hydrogeologic isolation (and conversely mixing) of fluids relevant to the deep carbon cycle, and on the geochemistry of substrates that sustain both abiotic organic synthesis and biogeochemical cycles driven by microbial communities. Ultimately the chemistry and hydrogeology of the deep hydrosphere will help define the limits for life in the subsurface and the boundary between the biotic-abiotic fringe. Using a variety of novel techniques including noble gas analysis, clumped isotopologues of methane, and compound specific isotope analysis of CHNOS, this research is addressing questions about the distribution of deep saline fluids in Precambrian rocks worldwide, the degree of interconnectedness of these potential biomes, the habitability of these fluids, and the biogeographic diversity of this new realm of the deep hydrosphere.",

On the Cutting Edge (CE) has offered more than 100 face-to-face and virtual workshops, webinars, journal clubs, and other events to more than 3000 participants. The award-winning website has more than 5000 pages including 47 modules on career management, pedagogy, and geoscience topics. It has more than 1800 instructional activities contributed by the community, the majority of which have been peer-reviewed. The website had more than one million visitors last year. We have worked to support a community in which faculty improve their teaching by designing courses using research-based methods to foster higher-order thinking, incorporate geoscience data, and address cognitive and affective aspects of learning as well as a community in which faculty are comfortable and successful in managing their careers. The program addresses the needs of faculty in all career stages at the full spectrum of institutions and covering the breadth of the geoscience curriculum. We select timely and compelling topics that attract different groups of participants. CE workshops are interactive, model best pedagogical practices, emphasize participant learning, provide opportunities for participants to share their knowledge and experience, provide high-quality resources, give participants time to reflect and to develop action plans, and help transform their ideas about teaching. On the Cutting Edge has had an impact on teaching based on data from national surveys, interview and classroom observation studies, and website usage.

            "abstract": "Extreme reductions in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness have become a hallmark of climate change, but impacts to the marine ecosystem are poorly understood. As top predators, marine mammals must adapt to biological responses to physical forcing and thereby become sentinels to ecosystem variability and reorganization. Recent sea ice retreats have influenced the ecology of marine mammals in the Pacific Arctic sector. Walruses now often haul out by the thousands along the NW Alaska coast in late summer, and reports of harbor porpoise, humpback, fin and minke whales in the Chukchi Sea demonstrate that these temperate species routinely occur there. In 2010, satellite tagged bowhead whales from Atlantic and Pacific populations met in the Northwest Passage, an overlap thought precluded by sea ice since the Holocene. To forage effectively, baleen whales must target dense patches of zooplankton and small fishes. In the Pacific Arctic, bowhead and gray whales appear to be responding to enhanced prey availability delivered both by new production and advection pathways. Two programs, the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) and the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR), include tracking of marine mammal and prey species’ responses to ecosystem shifts associated with sea ice loss. Both programs provide an integrated-ecosystem baseline in support of the development of a web-based Marine Mammal Health Map, envisioned as a component of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). An overarching goal is to identify ecological patterns for marine mammals in the ‘new’ Arctic, as a foundation for integrative research, local response and adaptive management.",

            "abstract": "Kilbourne Hole (NM, USA) and Dish Hill (CA, USA) mantle xenoliths sample continental mantle in two different tectonic settings. Kilbourne Hole (KH) is located in the Rio Grande rift. Dish Hill (DH) is located in the southern Mojave province, an area potentially affected by subduction of the Farallon plate beneath North America [1]. FTIR analyses were obtained on well characterized pyroxenite, dunite and wehrlite xenoliths, thought to represent crystallized melts at mantle depths. PUM normalized REE patterns of the KH bulk-rocks are slightly LREE enriched and consistent with those of liquids generated by < 5% melting of a spinel peridotite source [2]. Clinopyroxenes contain from 272 to 313 ppm weight H2O similar to the lower limit of KH peridotite clinopyroxenes (250-530 ppm H2O, [3]). This is unexpected as crystallized melts like pyroxenites should concentrate water more than residual mantle-like peridotites, given that H is incompatible. PUM normalized bulk REE of the DH pyroxenites are characterized by flat to LREE depleted REE profiles consistent with > 6% melting of a spinel peridotite source. Pyroxenite pyroxenes have no detectable water but one DH wehrlite, which bulk-rock is LREE enriched, has 4 ppm H2O in orthopyroxene and <1ppm in clinopyroxene. The DH pyroxenites may thus come from a dry mantle source, potentially unaffected by the subduction of the Farallon plate. These water-poor melts either originated from shallow oceanic lithosphere overlaying the Farallon slab [4] or from continental mantle formed > 2 Ga [5]. The Farallon subduction appears to have enriched in water the southwestern United States lithospheric mantle further east than DH, beneath the Colorado plateau [6].

            "abstract": "The University of Houston is in the process of developing a flexible program that offers children an in-depth educational experience culminating in the design and construction of their own model Mars rover: the Mars Rover Model Celebration (MRC). It focuses on students, teachers and parents in grades 3-8. Students design and build a model of a Mars rover to carry out a student selected science mission on the surface of Mars. A total of 140 Mars Rover teachers from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 cohorts were invited to complete the Mars Rover Teacher Evaluation Survey. The survey was administered online and could be taken at the convenience of the participant. So far ~40 teachers have participated with responses still coming in. A total of 675 students from the 2013-2014 cohort were invited to submit brief self-assessments of their participation in the program. Teachers were asked to rate their current level of confidence in their ability to teach specific topics within the Earth and Life Science realms, as well as their confidence in their ability to implement teaching strategies with their students. The majority of teachers (81-90%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively teach concepts related to earth and life sciences to their students. In addition, many of the teachers felt that their confidence in teaching these concepts increased somewhat to quite a bit as a result of their participation in the MRC program (54-88%). The most striking increase in this area was the reported 48% of teachers who felt their confidence in teaching “Earth and the solar system and universe” increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program. The vast majority of teachers (86-100%) felt somewhat to very confident in their ability to effectively implement all of the listed teaching strategies. The most striking increases were the percentage of teachers who felt their confidence increased “Quite a bit” as a result of their participation in the MRC program in the following areas: “Getting students interested in and curious about science” (63%); “Teaching science as a co-inquirer with students” (56%); and “Continually find better ways to teach science” (59%). Student outcome analysis is pending correlation with final progress reports for the participating students.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation patterns in the western US are characterized by a north-south dipole, typically manifesting as wet conditions in the northwest and a dry southwest. This pattern is, in large part, determined by the strength and position of the Pacific subtropical jet, which is responsible for the generation and trajectory of winter storms that provide the majority of annual moisture. Modern climate variability on interannual/decadal timescales results in latitudinal shifts in the boundary between the wet-north/dry-south; strong ENSO activity typically results in drying in the north and increased precipitation in the south. Previous paleoclimate work in the Great Basin has shown coherence in the timing of major climatic shifts in the Holocene, yet past spatial variability of the dipole remains little studied. Here we present new data from a site that lies within the transition zone of the precipitation dipole.\nSwan Lake, located in southeastern Idaho along the northeast edge of the Great Basin, was formed in the spillway channel created by the catastrophic flooding of Lake Bonneville ~14,500 yrs BP. This study seeks to provide insight into the timing and magnitude of late-glacial and Holocene climate variability in the northeastern Great Basin in order to better understand past spatial variability of precipitation patterns. Charcoal, pollen and sedimentological data from a 7.65 m sediment core from Swan Lake are used to reconstruct fire history and vegetation change in the area. Age control is provided by 15 AMS radiocarbon determinations. Results are placed in the context of regional paleoclimate studies. These data build on earlier work by Bright (1966) who reported on pollen, macrofossils and sedimentology from Swan Lake, as well as characterizing the modern vegetation biomes within this area and the climate conditions necessary for their occurrence.\nOur preliminary data suggest dramatic reduction in fire frequency coinciding with results from nearby studies that point to either cold or very wet climate phases. Principal cold/wet phases are: 12.5-6.5 and 4.6-1.0 ka BP. Quantitative analysis of charcoal influx data and comparison of pollen assemblages with modern biome/climate relationships provide a basis for testing this hypothesis of alternating climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The summit of Volcan Turrialba (elev. 3340 m) lies less than 50 km upstream in the prevailing easterlies from the Ticosonde balloon launch site at San Jose, Costa Rica, where ECC ozone sondes have been launched regularly since 2005. In 2006 we began to see telltale notches in the ozone profiles in the altitude range between 2 and 6 km. Given the proximity of Turrialba, it seemed likely that SO2 in the volcano's plume was interfering in the chemical reaction in the ECC ozone sonde used to detect ozone. In early 2010, fumarolic activity in the Turrialba crater increased strongly, and the profile notches in our soundings increased in frequency as well, consistent with this hypothesis. In February 2012 we tested a dual ECC sonde system, where an additional sonde is flown on the same payload using a selective SO2 filter. The difference of the measurements in the dual sonde is a direct measure of the amount of SO2 encountered. This first dual sonde passed through the plume, and the data indicated a tropospheric SO2 column of 1.4 DU, comparing favorably with a total column of 1.7 DU in the OMI 3-km linear fit (LF) product at the sonde profile location and at nearly the same time. We are now launching dual sondes on a regular basis with 18 launches in the first 12 months through July 2014; 11 of these have detectable SO2 signals. These soundings have great potential for validation of the Aura OMI and the Suomi-NPP OMPS retrievals of SO2. Here we present the sonde measurements and compare them with two satellite datasets: the Aura OMI Linear Fit (LF) product and the Suomi-NPP OMPS Principal Components Analysis (PCA) boundary layer product. The PCA algorithm reduces retrieval noise and artifacts by more accurately accounting for various interferences in SO2 retrievals such as O3 absorption and rotational Raman scattering. The comparisons with the in situ observations indicate a significant improvement of the PCA algorithm in capturing relatively weak volcanic SO2 signals.",

            "abstract": "We present a report on the development of an operational space weather tool for use with the upcoming DSCOVR spacecraft to forecast the delay time between L1 and Earth using the Weimer and King [2008] tilted phase front technique. The present technique for propagating the solar wind from L1 to Earth currently used by NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) assumes that all observed solar wind discontinuities, such as interplanetary shocks and interplanetary coronal mass ejection boundaries, are in a flat plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line traveling in the GSE X direction at the solar wind velocity. In reality, these phase plane fronts can have significantly tilted orientations, and by relying on a ballistic propagation method, delay time errors of ±15 minutes are common. The L1 to Earth delay time product presented here is designed to more accurately predict the delay time from L1 to Earth by taking into account these tilted phase plane fronts. This algorithm is based on the work of Weimer and King [2008] and is currently running in real-time in test mode at SWPC as part of the SWPC Testbed. We discuss the current algorithm performance, observed improvements in space weather forecasting, as well as the limitations of this model. Both real-time and historic events will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Risk assessments of the threat posed by rock avalanches rely upon numerical modelling of potential run-out and spreading, and are contingent upon a thorough understanding of the flow dynamics inferred from deposits left by previous events. Few records exist of multiple rock avalanches with boundary conditions sufficiently consistent to develop a set of more generalised rules for behaviour across events. A unique cluster of 20 large (3 x 106 – 94 x 106 m3) rock avalanche deposits along the Vaigat Strait, West Greenland, offers a unique opportunity to model a large sample of adjacent events sourced from a stretch of coastal mountains of relatively uniform geology and structure.\nOur simulations of these events were performed using VolcFlow, a geophysical mass flow code developed to simulate volcanic debris avalanches. Rheological calibration of the model was performed using a well-constrained event at Paatuut (AD 2000). The best-fit simulation assumes a constant retarding stress with a collisional stress coefficient (T0 = 250 kPa, ξ = 0.01), and simulates run-out to within ±0.3% of that observed. Despite being widely used to simulate rock avalanche propagation, other models, that assume either a Coulomb frictional or a Voellmy rheology, failed to reproduce the observed event characteristics and deposit distribution at Paatuut. We applied this calibration to 19 other events, simulating rock avalanche motion across 3D terrain of varying levels of complexity.\nOur findings illustrate the utility and sensitivity of modelling a single rock avalanche satisfactorily as a function of rheology, alongside the validity of applying the same parameters elsewhere, even within similar boundary conditions. VolcFlow can plausibly account for the observed morphology of a series of deposits emplaced by events of different types, although its performance is sensitive to a range of topographic and geometric factors. These exercises show encouraging results in the model’s ability to simulate a series of events using a single set of parameters obtained by back-analysis of the Paatuut event alone. The results also hold important implications for our process understanding of rock avalanches in confined fjord settings, where correctly modelling material flux at the point of entry into the water is critical in tsunami generation.",

            "abstract": "Data on greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange in high Arctic environments is rare but badly needed, as the environment in these places will likely respond early and most rapidly to climate warming. Also, the high Arctic holds carbon stocks in permafrost that is most likely to be made vulnerable to decomposition as ecosystems get warmer.\nIn 2011 we established a long-term GHG flux-monitoring site in the Adventdalen valley on the Svalbard archipelago. The site is characterised by little precipitation (about 200 mm/year), a strong marine influence (summer air temperatures predominantly around 5 degrees Celsius), and a continuous permafrost ground with low-centered ice wedge polygons at the surface. The measurement equipment features an eddy-covariance tower and an automatic chamber system, both set up in accordance with already existing monitoring programs (INTERACT, ICOS and the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring program). Here, we present the first results of this multi-year campaign, such as the pattern of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes during the growing and shoulder seasons, including the recently discovered autumn burst, as well as carbon dioxide fluxes during wintertime.\nCarbon dioxide fluxes measured with eddy-covariance agree well with the automatic chamber data, and indicate that the site acts as a sink for carbon dioxide. Methane fluxes measured by the automatic chamber system indicate a significant methane source, which is, however, weaker than at comparable sites in Greenland. There is a high degree of inter-annual variation in methane emissions, which seems to be driven by the amount of precipitation in summer. On top of that, there is a strong spatial variability resembling the polygonal ground pattern. This variability is also reflected in the occurrence of the methane autumn burst, which could be detected and is spatially and temporally distributed at a few locations and years.",

            "abstract": "Catchment systems deliver many benefits to society and ecology but also produce a range of undesirable externalities including flooding, diffuse pollution from agriculture, forestry and urban areas and the export of FIOs. These diffuse pressures are coupled with increasing stream temperature pressures on river from projected climate change. These pressures can be reduced through actions at the landscape scale but are often tackled individually. Any intervention may have benefits for other pressures and hence the challenge is to consider all of the different pressures simultaneously to find solutions with high levels of cross-pressure benefits.\nThe general approach taken within this research has been to use simple but spatially distributed models to predict the pattern of each of the pressures at the landscape scale. These models follow a minimum information requirement approach along the lines of the SCIMAP modelling approach (www.scimap.org.uk). This approach aims to capture the key features of the processes in relative rather than an absolute sense and hence is good at determining key locations to act within a landscape for maximum benefit. The core of the approach is to define the critical sources areas for each pressure based on the analysis of the pattern of the pressure in the landscape and the connectivity from the sources areas to the rivers and lakes.\nTo identify the optimal locations with the landscape for mitigation actions, the benefit of a mitigation action at each location in the landscape needs to be considered. However, as one action has been made, it may change the suitability of other locations in the landscape. For example, as tree cover reduces the temperature in one river reach, the impacts of this cooling are transported downstream with the flow. Therefore, actions need to be considered in sets across multiple sites and objectives to identify the optimal actions set.\nThese modelling results are integrated into a decision support tool which allows the user to explore the implications of considering an individual pressure as opposed to the set of pressures. This is achieved by allowing the user to change the importance of different pressures to identify the optimal locations for a custom combination of pressures. For example, reductions in flood risk can be prioritized over reductions in fine sediment.",

            "abstract": "Hemipelagic sediments in several central West Greenland trough mouth fan cores are critical for testing whether an ice shelf covered Baffin Bay during the late LGM and H1 (core HU2008029-12PC) and to investigate the role of ocean warming in initiating and/or sustaining retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet from the shelf edge (cores JR175-VC29 & -VC46). We use benthic and planktic foram assemblages, IP25 sea ice biomarker, ice-rafted detritus (IRD), lithofacies and quantitative mineralogy to reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions. HU2008029-12PC comprises bioturbated, thin turbidites and hemipelagic sediments with Greenlandic provenance from >19.2 to 16.7 cal ka BP. Abundance spikes of planktic forams provide the radiocarbon dates in this interval and coincide with abundance spikes of benthic foram species indicative of chilled Atlantic Water and episodic marine productivity. IRD and IP25 are rare in this interval. These characteristics are consistent with the ice margin at the shelf edge meeting a heavily sea-ice covered ocean with chilled Atlantic Water at depth, rather than an ice shelf-covered ocean. Initial deglaciation from the West Greenland margin began c. 16.7 ka BP, as recorded by a lithofacies shift from turbidites to bioturbated mud with dispersed IRD and continued presence of Atlantic Water benthic species. After 16.7 ka BP, IP25, large diatoms and benthic forams indicative of sea-ice edge productivity show warming conditions. By 15.2 ka BP Greenlandic IRD and meltwater species, Elphidium excavatum, reflect accelerated ice sheet ablation. By 14.4 ka BP a strong rise in IP25 content, introduction of key Atlantic Water species Cassidulina neoteretis, and IRD spikes rich in detrital carbonate with a northern Baffin Bay provenance provide evidence for increased advection of West Greenland Current, collapse of the LIS ice streams, and formation of an IRD belt along the W.

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause facilitates the transfer of mass, energy, and momentum from the solar wind into the Earth’s magnetosphere. Owing to the variability of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field, the reconnection process typically involves different conditions on both inflow sides, but occasionally more symmetric conditions are encountered as well. Based on prior research we now know that the structure of the reconnection diffusion region depends substantially on the symmetry (or lack thereof) of the inflowing plasmas and magnetic fields. It is therefore of considerable interest to investigate the transition of one scenario to the other - in particular for the purpose of understanding the role of plasma mixing, heating, and of features such as pressure nongyrotropies. This presentation will involve recent theory and modeling results pertaining to these topics, and it will illuminate the means by which these kinetic processes play a role in determining the reconnection rate. Specific emphasis will be on the structure of the reconnection region, when both inflow regions are asymmetric and reconnection occurs at shear angles other than 180 degrees.",

            "abstract": "Mid-latitude precipitation over land exhibits a high degree of variability due to the complex interaction of governing atmospheric processes with coastlines, the heterogeneous land surface, and orography. General circulation models (GCMs) have traditionally shown limited ability in capturing variability in the mesoscale range (here ~50–500 km), due to their low resolution. Recent advances in resolution have provided ensembles of multidecadal climate simulations with GCMs using ~25 km grid spacing. Here, we assess this class of GCM simulations, from the UPSCALE (UK on PrACE - weather-resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk) campaign.\nIncreased model resolution also poses new challenges to the observational datasets used to evaluate models. Global gridded data products (e.g. from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, GPCP) are invaluable for assessing large-scale precipitation features, but may not sufficiently resolve mesoscale structures. In the absence of alternative estimates, the intercomparison of specialised, regional observational datasets may be the only way to gain insight into the uncertainties associated with these observations. We focus on three mid-latitude continental regions where gridded precipitation observations based on higher-density gauge networks are available, complementing the global data sets: Europe (with a particular emphasis on the Alps), South and East Asia, and the continental US.\nAdditional motivation, and opportunity, arises from continuing efforts to quantify the components of the global radiation budget and water cycle. Recent estimates based on radiation measurements suggest that the global mean precipitation/evaporation may be up to 10 Wm-2 (about 0.35 mm day-1) larger than the estimate obtained from GPCP. While the main part of this discrepancy is thought to be due to the underestimation of remotely-sensed ocean precipitation, there is also considerable uncertainty about ‘unobserved’ precipitation over land, in particular in the form of snow in regions of high latitude/altitude.\nCombining the strength of these different observations, we present case studies of how area-averaged mountain precipitation is represented in different observational datasets and by a GCM at different resolutions.",

            "abstract": "From the late Paleocene to the early Eocene, Earth’s surface temperatures generally rose, resulting in an increase of at least 5°C in the deep ocean and culminating in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). This long-term warming was punctuated by a series of short-lived global warming events known as “hyperthermals”, of which the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) represents the most extreme example. At least two other short-term episodes have been identified as hyperthermals: the ETM2 (or Elmo event) at about 53.7 Myr and the ETM3 (or X-event) at about 52.5 Myr. These transient events are marked by prominent carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), recorded in marine and continental sedimentary sequences and driven by fast and massive injections of 13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system. Recently, evidence has indicated the presence of a regular series of hyperthermal events following the peak in temperatures of the EECO. However, continuous records are needed to investigate short- and long- term changes in the climate system throughout the Early Eocene warming trend. Here, we present new high-resolution benthic stable isotope records of the Early Eocene from ODP Site 1263, (Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic). The carbon and oxygen records document changes in deep-sea temperature and global carbon cycle encompassing the Early Eocene hyperthermal events and the EECO interval. The transition phase to the post-EECO events is distinct by the decoupling of carbon and oxygen isotopes on the long-term scale. Spectral and wavelet analyses suggest the influence of orbital forcing, specifically long and short eccentricity cycles.",

            "abstract": "In Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, the identification of an ancient, low-relief landscape has provided an important datum for measuring surface uplift and inferring geodynamic process. It has been argued that a regionally significant landscape surface was formed by river planation and deposition at low elevation. Thereafter, this surface was progressively uplifted and incised as the Tibetan Plateau grew during Neogene time. However, recent geomorphic analysis and stable isotope paleoaltimetry have indicated a more complex history of surface uplift. We present new Be-10 drainage-average erosion rates and normalized river steepness (Ks) calculations from both on and off the mapped remnants of the paleolandscape in order to understand its evolution. We sampled river sands for Be-10 from 16 tributaries of the Red, Mekong and Yantze Rivers in clusters that span Yunnan and western-most Sichuan between 22.5° N and 28.5° N. Each cluster typically includes samples from 2 small (~25 km2) tributaries and 1 larger (~1000 km2) tributary that encompass both smaller ones. We also calculated Ks values for these tributaries and others in the region, covering ~140,000 km2 in total. At the provincial scale, Be-10 erosion rates appear uniform, with an average value of 104 mm/kyr and a standard deviation of 36 mm/yr. There is no trend with latitude. At a finer scale, within each sample cluster, erosion rates are typically lower on the paleolandscape than off (mean rate on: 83 ± 12 mm/kyr (1 s.d.); mean rate off: 138 ± 19 mm/kyr (1 s.d.)). Ks values are also consistently lower on the mapped paleolandscape than off (mean on: 81 ± 26 (1 s.d.); mean off: 174 ± 98 (1 s.d.)). Unlike erosion rates, Ks values increase northward, with a pronounced jump near the Yalong-Yulong fault. Our results support the mapped paleolandscape as locally important. However, the erosion rates on the paleolandscape are likely too fast to preserve such a landscape over tens of millions of years. (Low-temperature thermochronology could confirm this.) We tentatively suggest that the fragments of “paleolandscape”, south of the Yalong-Yulong Fault, are independent features, constantly being created by river capture and destroyed by erosion.",

            "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to study and predict the outcome of global changes on species. In human dominated ecosystems the presence of a given species is the result of both its ecological suitability and human footprint on nature such as land use choices. Land use choices may thus be responsible for a selection bias in the presence/absence data used in SDM calibration. We present a structural modelling approach (i.e. based on structural equation modelling) that accounts for this selection bias. The new structural species distribution model (SSDM) estimates simultaneously land use choices and species responses to bioclimatic variables. A land use equation based on an econometric model of landowner choices was joined to an equation of species response to bioclimatic variables. SSDM allows the residuals of both equations to be dependent, taking into account the possibility of shared omitted variables and measurement errors. We provide a general description of the statistical theory and a set of applications on forest trees over France using databases of climate and forest inventory at different spatial resolution (from 2km to 8km). We also compared the outputs of the SSDM with outputs of a classical SDM (i.e. Biomod ensemble modelling) in terms of bioclimatic response curves and potential distributions under current climate and climate change scenarios. The shapes of the bioclimatic response curves and the modelled species distribution maps differed markedly between SSDM and classical SDMs, with contrasted patterns according to species and spatial resolutions. The magnitude and directions of these differences were dependent on the correlations between the errors from both equations and were highest for higher spatial resolutions. A first conclusion is that the use of classical SDMs can potentially lead to strong miss-estimation of the actual and future probability of presence modelled. Beyond this selection bias, the SSDM we propose represents a crucial step to account for economic constraints on tree species distributions that will help to assess the trade-offs and opportunities arising from global changes and refine adaptive management strategies.",

Recently, a large amount of CO2 concentration data are becoming available from high-frequency aircraft measurements (e.g., CONTRAIL) and satellite measurements (e.g., GOSAT and OCO-2), in addition to expansion of surface measurement networks. To exploit those observational data, a new inversion system has been developed with the four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) method. The system is based on Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model-based Transport Model (NICAM-TM), which consists of forward and adjoint transport modes. For the a priori fluxes at terrestrial biospheres and oceans, CO2 flux data from Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace Gases (VISIT) and the diagnostic model of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) are respectively used. In the iterative calculation, the quasi-Newton method of Preconditioned Optimizing Utility for Large-dimensional analyses (POpULar) is used. In this study, we present the structure of the newly developed system and performances for CO2 flux estimates in ideal twin experiments. By the twin experiments, sensitivities to prior error covariance, numerical algorithms, and observational networks are investigated.\nAcknowledgment: This study is supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1401) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",

            "abstract": "Primitive achondrites are a recently recognized meteorite grouping with textures and compositions intermediate between unmelted meteorites (chondrites) and igneous meteorites (achondrites). Their existence demonstrates prima facie that some planetesimals only experienced partial rather than complete melting. We present the first paleomagnetic measurements of acapulcoite-lodranite meteorites to determine the existence and intensity of ancient magnetic fields on their parent body. Our paleomagnetic study tests the hypothesis that their parent body had an advecting metallic core, with the goal of providing one of the first geophysical constraints on its large-scale structure and the extent of interior differentiation. In particular, by analyzing samples whose petrologic textures require an origin on a partially differentiated body, we will be able to critically test a recent proposal that some achondrites and chondrite groups could have originated on a single body (Weiss and Elkins-Tanton 2013).\nWe analyzed samples of the meteorites Acapulco and Lodran. Like other acapulcoites and lodranites, these meteorites are granular rocks containing large (~0.1-0.3 mm) kamacite and taenite grains along with similarly sized silicate crystals. Many silicate grains contain numerous fine (1-10 μm) FeNi metal inclusions. Our compositional measurements and rock magnetic data suggest that tetrataenite is rare or absent. Bulk paleomagnetic measurements were done on four mutually oriented bulk samples of Acapulco and one bulk sample of Lodran. Alternating field (AF) demagnetization revealed that the magnetization of the bulk samples is highly unstable, likely due to the large (~0.1-0.3 mm) interstitial kamacite grains throughout the samples. To overcome this challenge, we are analyzing individual ~0.2 mm mutually oriented silicate grains extracted using a wire saw micromill. Preliminary SQUID microscopy measurements of a Lodran silicate grain suggest magnetization stable to AF levels of at least 25-40 mT.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of drought is associated with agricultural loss, water supply shortfalls, and other economic impacts. Here we explore the physical relationships between precipitation deficits, high temperatures, and hydrologic responses as a pathway to better anticipate drought impacts. Current methodologies to predict hydrologic scarcity include local monitoring of river flows, remote sensing of land-surface wetness, drought indices, expert judgment, climate indices (e.g. SST-relationships) and the application of hydrologic models. At longer lead times, predictions of drought have most frequently been made on the basis of GCM ensembles, with subsequent downscaling of those to scales over which hydrologic predictions can be made. This study focuses on two important aspects of drought. First, we explore the causal hydro-climatic timeline of a drought event, namely (a) the lack of precipitation, which serves to reduce soil moisture and produce (b) a skewed Bowen ratio, i.e. comparatively more sensible heating (warming) with less ET, resulting in (c) anomalously warm conditions. We seek to assess the extent to which the lack of precipitation contributes to warming temperatures, and the further effects of that warming on hydrology and the severity of drought impacts. An ensemble of GCM simulations will be used to explore the evolution of the land surface energy budget during a recent Great Plains drought event, which will subsequently be used to drive a hydrologic model. Second, we examine the impacts of the critical assumptions relating climatic variables with water demand, specifically the relationship between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and temperature. The common oversimplification in relating PET to temperature is explored against a more physically consistent energy balance estimate of PET, using the Penman-Monteith approach and the hydrologic impacts are presented. Results from this work are anticipated to have broad relevance for future water management and planning, to better characterize drought impacts.",

A regional body wave tomographic 3D model was obtained using 23.300 locally recorded earthquakes coming from different deployments done in northern Chile between 1990 and the 2014 Mw=8.2 sequence, including the dense 2013 short period FONDECYT 1130071 around Pisagua. Through this way, the 3D architecture of the major forearc faults in the study area was determined for the first time using a geological and geophysical approach. Previous studies in the northern Chile seismic gap, between the coast and the Altiplano, established the presence of abundant microseismic activity in the upper part of the interplate contact, corresponding to continental intraplate seismicity. These geometrical arrangements, from the surface down to 40 km depth, are almost perpendicular to the subducting slab, and are well correlated with low Vp/Vs ratio, indicating the presence of a fractured zone and well correlated with the Neogene. Kilometer-long faults existing in the northern Chilean region, indicating that the outer forearc absorb permanent deformation through active faulting. It is interesting to note that some low-magnitude earthquakes associated with the 2014 aftershock sequence are found along the mentioned faults, indicating their ability to be activated upon the occurrence of a large earthquake",

            "abstract": "Different atomic arrangements of perovskite (pv) and post-perovskite (ppv) in the systems MgSiO3-FeSiO3 and MgSiO3-FeAlO3 (MS-FS and MS-FA) were examined by Boltzmann statistics and density functional theory (GGA+U). The vibrational contribution to the free energy is calculated within the quasi-harmonic approximation. The FS and FA components partition in opposite directions, towards ppv and pv, respectively. The diverse experimental results on the Fe-partitioning between the two phases are broadly consistent with our theoretical investigation.\nWe determined a Clapeyron slope for the pv-ppv transition of 9.6 MPa/K for MS, decreasing to 8.4 and 8.1 MPa/K at 6.3 and 12.5 mol% FS and to 8.2 and 7.3 MPa/K at 6.3 and 12.5 mol% FA. An isochemical pv to ppv transition within the investigated solid solution range (up tp 25 mol% FS and FA) is characterized by decreasing bulk and increasing shear modulus. At a reference pressure of ­­­100 GPa, the bulk modulus for pv and ppv increases by 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, from MS to MS-FS12.5 and decreases by 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, from MS to MS-FA12.5 (subscripts indicate mol%). The shear modulus decreases for both pv and ppv along both of the solid solution series from the pure MS composition, with the largest decrese along the FA-join. For pv and ppv the shear modulus decreases with 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively from MS100 to MS-FS12.5 and with 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, from MS100 to MS-FA12.5. The results for the MS-FS join are in general agreement with previous DFT-studies (Caracas & Cohen, 2005, GRL; Stackhouse et al. 2006, GRL; Stackhouse & Brodholt 2008, PEPI). Boffa Ballaran et al. (2012, EPSL), however, found a decrease in the bulk modulus for pv on the MS-FS join relative to pure MS. The decreasing bulk modulus along the MS-FA join agrees with Boffa Ballaran et al.\nA chemical reaction from FA-rich pv and reduced Fe to form FS-rich ppv produces additional Al2O3 and MgO:\n2 FeAlO3 + 3 MgSiO3 + Fe = 3 FeSiO3 + Al2O3 + 3 MgO\nIn peridotite, the excess MgO and Al2O3 may dissolve in ferropericlase and ppv, respectively. If ppv becomes Al-saturated, Ca-ferrite- (CF) or Ca-titanite- (CT) structured phases with the MgAl2O4 component might form. In basaltic rocks MgAl2O4 may enter preexisting CF-CT-phases and excess MgO may combine with SiO2 from silica-dominated phases to the MS-component of ppv.",

However these programs only accommodate a limited number of students due to funding constraints, faculty time commitments, and limited access to needed instrumentation. At JMU, the Department of Geology and Environmental Science has embedded undergraduate research into the curriculum. Each student fulfilling a BS in Geology or a BA in Earth Science completes 3 credits of research, including a 1-credit course on scientific communication, 2 credits of research or internship, followed by a presentation of that research. Our department has successfully acquired many analytical instruments and now has an XRD, SEM/EDS, FTIR, handheld Raman, AA, ion chromatograph, and an IRMS. To give as many students as possible an overview to the scientific uses and operation methods for these instruments, we revived a laboratory methods course that includes theory and practical use of instrumentation at JMU, plus XRF sample preparation and analysis training at Virginia Tech during a 1-day field trip. In addition to practical training, projects included analytical concepts such as evaluating analytical vs. natural uncertainty, determining error on multiple measurements, signal-to-noise ratio, and evaluating data quality. State funding through the 4-VA program helped pay for analytical supplies and support for students to complete research projects over the summer or during the next academic year using instrumentation from the course. This course exemplifies an alternative path to broadening participation in undergraduate research and creating stronger partnerships between PUI’s and research universities.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty for bedload estimates in gravel bed rivers is largely driven by our inability to characterize the arrangement and orientation of the sediment grains within the bed. The characteristics of the surface structure are produced by the water working of grains, which leads to structural differences in bedforms through differential patterns of grain sorting, packing, imbrication, mortaring and degree of bed armoring. Until recently the technical and logistical difficulties of characterizing the arrangement of sediment in 3D have prohibited a full understanding of how grains interact with stream flow and the feedback mechanisms that exist.\nMicro-focus X-ray CT has been used for non-destructive 3D imaging of grains within a series of intact sections of river bed taken from key morphological units (see Figure 1). Volume, center of mass, points of contact, protrusion and spatial orientation of individual surface grains are derived from these 3D images, which in turn, facilitates estimates of 3D static force properties at the grain-scale such as pivoting angles, buoyancy and gravity forces, and grain exposure.\nBy aggregating representative samples of grain-scale properties of localized interacting sediment into overall metrics, we can compare and contrast bed stability at a macro-scale with respect to stream bed morphology. Understanding differences in bed stability through representative metrics derived at the grain-scale will ultimately lead to improved bedload estimates with reduced uncertainty and increased understanding of interactions between grain-scale properties on channel morphology.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Ecosystem science has a long history as a core component of the discipline of Ecology, and although topics of research have fluctuated over the years, it retains a clear identity and continues to be a vital field. As science is becoming more interdisciplinary, particularly the science of global environmental change, ecosystem scientists are addressing new and important questions at the interface of multiple disciplines. Over the last two years, we organized a series of workshops and discussion groups at multiple scientific-society meetings, including AGU to identify frontiers in ecosystem research. The workshops featured short “soapbox” presentations where speakers highlighted key questions in ecosystem science. The presentations were recorded (video and audio) and subjected to qualitative text analysis for identification of frontier themes, attendees completed surveys, and a dozen additional “key informants” were interviewed about their views about frontiers of the discipline.\nOur effort produced 253 survey participants; the two largest groups of participants were full professors (24%) and graduate students (24%); no other specific group was > 10%. Formal text analysis of the soapbox presentations produced three major themes; “frontiers,” “capacity building,” and “barriers to implementation” with four or five sub-themes within each major theme. Key “frontiers” included; 1) better understanding of the drivers of ecosystem change, 2) better understanding of ecosystem process and function, 3) human dimensions of ecosystem science, and 4) problem-solving/applied research. Under “capacity building,” key topics included: holistic approaches, cross-disciplinary collaboration, public support for research, data, training, and technology investment. Under “barriers” key topics included: limitations in theoretical thinking, insufficient funding/support, fragmentation across discipline, data access and data synthesis. In-depth interviews with 13 experts validated findings from analysis of soapbox presentations and surveys and also resulted in a conceptual model for understanding disciplinary frontiers.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the structure of the lithosphere is vital to our comprehension of plate tectonic processes. Using a seismograph network in Quebec, Canada, we attempt to identify horizontal discontinuities associated with the crust and lithospheric mantle. We also investigate systematic changes in these discontinuities across the Grenville Front and Appalachian Front, two tectonic boundaries separating the Proterozoic Grenville Province from the Archean Superior craton to the north and the Appalachian orogen to the south.\nUsing data from long-term seismic stations, we analyzed over 3000 teleseismic earthquakes from the period 2000-2013. For each station we constructed P-to-S receiver function (RF) gathers arranged by backazimuth and epicentral distance, to identify individual phases that we can associate with seismic boundaries within the crust and upper mantle.\nAt stations across the Superior craton, we see a strong positive phase at ~5 s with a prominent first multiple, suggesting a flat, sharp Moho boundary at ~35 km depth. A phase at ~2 s is also pervasive, likely due to an intra-crustal boundary. We do not see any evidence for a sharp lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in the RF data for this region. A remarkably similar structure is inferred at stations within the Grenville Province.\nAround the St. Lawrence River, observations from both sides of the Appalachian Front are broadly similar to each other, but systematically different from those further north. The Moho phase suggests a crustal thickness of ~40-45 km, and we do not observe any pulses that may be interpreted as Moho multiples. The crustal structure is more complex, with significant directional variation in RF signal at individual sites, and noticeable differences in RF gathers between stations separated by tens of km. This complexity likely explains the lack of coherent crustal multiples. At some stations, a negative pulse at ~15-17 s is observed, consistent with a predicted LAB depth of ~150 km.\nOur data suggest that the surface tectonic boundaries of the Grenville Province do not correspond to significant changes in lithospheric discontinuity structure at depth. Instead, a major change in lithospheric layering is inferred between the St. Lawrence River and the northern Grenville Province near Lac St-Jean.",

            "abstract": "The aeolian dust deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau are attributed to spring and winter monsoonal storms sweeping clastic material from the deserts of the Asian interior into central China and are reported to begin 25-22 million years (Myr) ago. The beginning of aeolian dust sedimentation has been attributed to the onset of central Asia desertification and winter monsoonal circulation, and are commonly linked to development of high topographic relief associated with the Tibetan-Himalayan orogenic system. However, recent papers suggest that the core of the Tibetan Plateau may have reached significant elevation since the earliest phases of the India-Asia collision 55 Myr ago.\nHere, we extend the sedimentary record of the Chinese Loess Plateau at its western margin to include the late Eocene - late Oligocene deposits of the Xining Basin, which were deposited between 41 and 25 Myr ago based on detailed magnetostratigraphy. The particle size, shape, and surface microtexture of quartz grains in these deposits display textures indicative of prolonged aeolian transport; grain-size distributions show a bimodal distribution similar to Miocene through Quaternary deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The clay mineralogy of the finer fraction and U/Pb zircon ages of the coarser fraction from Xining Loess sediments sampled along three sections spanning the whole studied interval are also similar to those observed in Quaternary and Neogene aeolian deposits of the Chinese Loess Plateau and thus suggest similar sources located in central China. However, slight differences in Eocene U/Pb zircon ages, such as the lack of Cenozoic ages or the scarcity of zircons older than 2000 Myr, suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may have contributed little to the aeolian dust deposition, in favor of sources located further north and west (Kunlun and Tian Shan Ranges).\nThe Xining deposits are thus the first direct evidence that winter monsoonal winds were active 15 Myr earlier than previously reported and indicate that the process of central Asian desertification was already significant. Together with Eocene East Asian palynological datasets and recently published paleoclimatic data from the Eocene proto-Bengal Bay, these results provide additional evidence that the monsoons are much older than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "In recent years the known diversity of hydrocarbon activation mechanisms under anaerobic conditions has been extended by intra-aerobic denitrification, a process in which oxygen is derived from NO and used for substrate activation. For two phylogenetically unrelated bacterial species, the freshwater NC10 phylum bacterium Methylomirabilis oxyfera [1] and the marine γ-proteobacterial strain HdN1 [2] it has been shown that, under anoxic conditions with nitrate and/or nitrite, mono-oxygenases are used for methane and hexadecane oxidation, respectively. No degradation was observed with nitrous oxide (N2O) only. In the anaerobic methanotroph M. oxyfera, which lacks apparent nitrous oxide reductase in its genome, substrate activation in the presence of nitrite was directly associated with both O2 and N2 formation. These findings strongly argue for the role of nitric oxide (NO), or an oxygen species derived from it, in the activation reaction of methane. Although intracellular oxygen generation has been experimentally documented and elegantly explains the utilization of ‘aerobic’ pathways under anoxic conditions, research about the underlying molecular mechanism has just started. The proposed candidate enzymes for oxygen (or possibly another another reactive intermediate) production from NO, an NO dismutase (NOD) [3], related to quinol-dependent NO reductases (qNORs), is present and highly expressed in both M. oxyfera and strain HdN1. Besides that, several recently sequenced species from the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group harbor Nod/Nor genes, but experimential evidence is needed to show if these have NOD activity, are unusual but functional qNORs, or represent transition states between the two. Additionally, for several anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading organisms the biochemical mechanism of substrate activation has not been elucidated yet: whereas signature genes of anaerobic degradation are missing, monooxygenase genes are present. Also these microorganisms may, analogously to chlorate-reducing bacteria, produce their own supply of oxygen to activate recalcitrant hydrocarbons in anoxic environments.\n[1] Ettwig et al.

            "abstract": "The origin of the relation between the MJO and the cyclogenesis above the south Indian Ocean during austral summer (October to March) is analyzed. The emphasis is put on the physical process at the origin of the initiation of tropical depressions (TD) and on the probability for a TD to reach the Tropical Storm strength (sustained wind > 33 kt). An original TD tracking approach, based on ERA-Interim geopotential fields, is developed. Cyclogenetic TDs are identified by a comparison with the IBTrACS dataset. About 1/3 of the TD are cyclogenetic and this proportion is only slightly modulated by the MJO. The MJO modulation of the number of cyclones is thus mostly due to the modulation of the number of TD initiations.\nThe TD are initiated mostly over three regions centered at 10°S and at 55°E, 75°E and 95°E. The TD initiation is due to the development of an unstable (inversion of the PV meridional gradient) cyclonic meridional shear of the zonal wind at low-levels. This shear results first from a heat low, due to a convective perturbation, which triggers westerly winds north of the TD initiation region. The shear is reinforced by large-scale geostrophic easterly wind south of the initiation regions due either to a reinforcement of the subtropical high (for the western IO) or to a large-scale depression above the Maritime Continent (for the eastern IO). This large-scale depression is related more directly to the MJO than the subtropical high and the MJO thus modulates primarily the TD initiation in the eastern IO (a factor of 5 between active and inactive MJO phases).",

            "abstract": "Over the years significant progress has been made in understanding the regional geologic models of the Greenstone Belts associated with gold mineralization in the fields of exploration geochemistry, geophysics and data integration. Improved knowledge of the geological models together with advancements in exploration techniques have resulted in the discovery of many near surface, and relatively large gold mines around the world such as the Abitibi, Isua, Barberton, Lake Victoria, Sadiola, and Yatela.\nHowever, the search for new deposits becomes more difficult due to the fact that most easily detectable, near surface deposits have been discovered. Many of the remaining deposits tend to be remotely located and deep underground. Effective exploration for new economically viable deposits requires approaches that integrate multiple techniques capable of resolving smaller, deeper and remotely located resources.\nGravity surveys have been widely used to map and define geometry and structure of greenstones belts at a regional scale. Structure and hydrothermally altered zones can be mapped, either directly by gravity in weathered environments or inferred in terrains where geological units of different density are offset and/or altered\nGravity gradiometry is increasingly becoming a standard method of commercial minerals exploration. Gradiometry presents a significant increase in spatial resolution when compared to previous airborne gravity methods. Airborne full tensor gravity gradiometry surveys have been flown in the past for prospect-level gold exploration in Quebec, Nunavut, Nevada, Brazil, Mali, Zambia and New Zealand and Nevada.\nThe application of airborne gravity gradiometry for prospect-level gold exploration over greenstone belts is discussed in this paper. The high resolution system capability to detect small, high frequency targets is the key for successful results. In addition, this paper presents and discusses data enhancement and 3D inversion results. It is expected that the result of data enhancement and 3D inversion will help resolve subsurface structures associated with gold mineralization and updates the existing geological model over the property.",

            "abstract": "This study aimed to develop index for sustainable water use over hydrologic units in South Korea. We identified major indicators for sustainable water use with considering multiple aspects of water use: not only physical, biological and chemical aspects but also social and environmental aspects. Furthermore, stressors for sustainable water use were of major interests because they were straightforward and easy to measure in comparison to indicators representing the state- and impact-related indictors. As a result, sustainability index was constructed with a theme-based hierarchical approach. It is comprised of two components of stress and response to sustainable water use and each component includes five sub-components of human water requirements, water quality requirements, 4) h, equitable water use and others. Then for each sub-component, multiple indicators, i.e., proxy variables were identified. For drainage basins in South Korea, standard hydrologic units with their total number of about 100 across the country, total 19 indicators were identified and their data from the various sources such as remote-sensing based datasets and survey-based national datasets were collected for current times. Then they were integrated to estimate the sustainability index with a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. At last, we evaluated sustainability index with focusing on the spatial variability of indices and indicators and the sensitivity of indices to individual indicators to better understand the sustainability of water use in Korea. In addition, we derived the indices with different MCDM methods to evaluate the sensitivity of index to various mathematical techniques.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate up to what extent the spatial heterogeneity in the projected changes in DTR during the rest of the 21st century (under several emission scenarios) is explained by the regional variability in projected precipitation changes. DTR is indeed a suitable index of climate variability and change [1] and several studies have highlighted the existence of a negative correlation with both the cloud cover and the precipitation rate over land throughout last century [2]. Precipitation reduces DTR mainly by decreasing surface solar radiation through increased cloud cover and by increasing daytime surface evaporative cooling through increased soil moisture content. Whether or not these processes are captured in the current generation of global and regional models is matter of research.\nTo achieve our objective, we make use of the climate projections made available by the CMIP5 project as well as their historical runs, along with reanalysis and station data. At inter-annual timescale, the seasonal mean DTR simulated by an ensemble of CMIP5 models for the last decades shows a negative relationship over land with the simulated precipitation at zero lag. The correlation is globally very strong except during winter at higher latitudes. This corresponds well with the correlations observed in the re-analysis datasets. Some spatial variability in correlation strength is however noticeable between both datasets.\nConcerning the projected changes, the negative correlation between DTR and precipitation does not hold globally; no correlation or even positive correlations are observed in different climate regions, including Northern South America and Central Europe. Within this study we will further investigate the physical process that could explain this change in correlation sign as well as the reason why positive correlations are rarely observed or simulated at inter-annual timescale under current climate during summer and at lower latitudes during winter.\n[1] K.

            "abstract": "Regime diagrams are commonly employed in geophysical fluid dynamics to classify experimental results and, ideally, to define non-dimensional parameters that allow those results to be applied to natural systems. Petrologic experiments, in contrast, are typically run to mimic a specific natural system, and to infer conditions of magma storage, cooling or decompression. This approach has produced important insight into specific volcanoes, but the results are difficult to generalize. Additionally, very few experimental studies evaluate the vesiculation, crystallization and degassing histories of the same sample suite, an omission that is understandable given the time-consuming nature of the experiments and analysis, but which leaves important gaps in our general understanding of the interplay between gas exsolution, crystal formation and eruption dynamics.\nOne way to bridge these gaps is to construct a regime diagram for conditions of vesiculation and crystallization. As both are controlled by the effective supercooling experienced by the magma during cooling or decompression, one key parameter is supersaturation, although in practice, decompression rate (cooling rate) are commonly used as proxies for supersaturation. Vesiculation and crystallization are also modulated by diffusion (dependent on individual species and melt viscosity), which can be simply approximated by melt composition. Using these parameters and published data for water-saturated decompression experiments, the following fields can be (partially) defined: (1) non-equilibrium volatile exsolution, (2) equilibrium volatile exsolution, and (3) exsolution accompanied by crystallization. Melt compositions, volatile contents and crystal textures of natural samples can be measured, and thus related (crudely) to the regime diagram. Additional information required for fully linking experiments and volcanic pyroclasts includes phase proportions (crystallization efficiency), pyroclast textures (phase change conditions) and gas loss (closed- or open-system degassing). Although simplified, this approach helps to provide a kinetic framework for predicting threshold behaviors (such as transitions from explosive to effusive, or steady to pulsatory) that characterize volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "Productivity hotspots are traditionally defined as concentrations of relatively high biomass compared to global reference values. These hotspots often signal atypical processes occurring in a location, and identifying them is a great first step at understanding the complexity inherent in the system. However, identifying local hotspots can be difficult when an overarching global pattern (i.e. spatial autocorrelation) already exists. This problem is particularly apparent in marine ecosystems because values of productivity in near-shore areas are consistently higher than those of the open ocean due to oceanographic processes such as upwelling. In such cases, if the global reference layer used to detect hotspots is too wide, hotspots may be only identified near the coast while missing known concentrations of organisms in offshore waters. On the other hand, if the global reference layer is too small, every single location may be considered a hotspot. We applied spatial and traditional statistics to remote sensing data to determine the optimal reference global spatial scale for identifying marine productivity hotspots in the Gulf of Maine. Our iterative process measured Getis and Ord’s local G* statistic at different global scales until the variance of each hotspot was maximized. We tested this process with different full resolution MERIS chlorophyll layers (300m spatial resolution) for the whole Gulf of Maine. We concluded that the optimal global scale depends on the time of the year the remote sensing data was collected, particularly when coinciding with known seasonal phytoplankton blooms. The hotspots found through this process were also spatially heterogeneous in size, with bigger hotspots in areas offshore than in locations inshore. These results may be instructive for both managers and fisheries researchers as they adapt their fisheries management policies and methods to an ecosystem based approach (EBM).",

This suggests that climate models need to simulate the degree of organization of convection, and not just the mean precipitation and convective fluxes, in order to fully represent interactions between convection and larger scales. In this study, we use five years of CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud profiles alongside TRMM rainfall, geostationary IR data, ERA-Interim water vapor, and other observations to investigate the relationship between vertical cloud distributions and the SCAI aggregation index. We find that there is a significant decrease in anvil cloud (and in cloudiness as a whole) and increase in shallow cumulus as aggregation increases (for a given precipitation rate). There are also greater variations in most cloud fractions and types when varying SCAI for a given precipitation than when varying precipitation for a given SCAI.",

            "abstract": "The Bracco-Levanto ophiolitic complex (northwestern Italy) represents one of the largest and better-exposed ophiolitic successions in the Northern Apennines. It is considered to be a fragment of heterogeneous Jurassic lithosphere that records tectono-magmatic and alteration histories similar to those documented along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), such as at the 15°20’N area and the Atlantis Massif at 30°N. Structural and petrological studies on these rocks provide constraints on metamorphic/deformation processes during formation and hydrothermal alteration of the Jurassic oceanic lithosphere. We present a petrological and geochemical study of serpentinization processes and fluid-rock interaction in the Bracco-Levanto ophiolitic complex and compare these to published data from modern oceanic hydrothermal systems, such as the Lost City hydrothermal field hosted in serpentinites on the Atlantis Massif. Major element and mineral compositional data allow us to distinguish a multiphase history of alteration characterized by: (1) widespread Si-metasomatism during progressive serpentinization, and (2) multiple phases of veining and carbonate precipitation associated with circulation of seawater in the shallow ultramafic-dominated portions of the Jurassic seafloor, resulting in the formation of ophicalcites. In detail, regional variations in Si, Mg and Al content are observed in zones of ophicalcite formation, indicating metasomatic reactions and Si-Al transport during long-lived fluid-rock interaction and channelling of hydrothermal fluids. Rare earth element and isotopic analysis indicate that the Si-rich fluids are derived from alteration of pyroxenes to talc and tremolite in ultramafic rocks at depth. Comparison with serpentinites from the Atlantis Massif and 15°20’N indicates a similar degree of Si-enrichment in the modern seafloor and suggests that Si-metasomatism may be a fundamental process associated with serpentinization at slow-spreading ridge environments. However, in contrast to metasomatic processes at the MAR, we find no geochemical evidence for a gabbroic source of the fluids, and thus, processes leading to Si-rich fluids can be variable in these environments.",

We present\nsimultaneous observations of these radio bursts from the STEREO A, B and WIND spacecraft at low frequencies, located at different vantage points in the ecliptic plane. Using these stereoscopic observations, we\ndetermine the directivity of these complex radio bursts. We estimate the angles between the directions of the magnetic field at the sources and the lines connecting the source to the spacecraft (viewing angles) by assuming that the sources are located on the Parker spiral magnetic field lines emerging from the associated active regions into the spherically symmetric solar atmosphere. We estimate the normalized peak intensities of these bursts (directivity factors) at each spacecraft using their time profiles at each spacecraft. These observations indicate that the complex type III bursts can be divided into two groups: (1) bursts emitting into a very narrow cone centered around the tangent to the magnetic field, and (2) bursts emitting into a wider cone. We show that the bursts , which are emitted along the tangent to the spiral magnetic field lines at the source are very intense, and their intensities steadily fall as the viewing angles increase to higher values. We have developed a ray tracing code and computed the distributions of the trajectories of rays emitted at the fundamental and second harmonic of the electron plasma frequency. The comparison of the observed emission patterns with the computed distributions of the ray\ntrajectories indicate that the intense bursts visible in a narrow range of angles around the magnetic field directions probably are emitted in the fundamental mode, whereas the relatively\nweaker bursts visible to a wide range of angles are probably emitted in the harmonic mode.",

From the initial proposal forward into airing on public television in 2011 and 2012, ETOM aimed to be authoritative and apolitical while still being engaging to general audiences. Based on social scientific insights from project Advisor, Suzanne Moser, and others, ETOM aimed to avoid “climate porn” scare tactics and over-used footage, and to enlist a diverse group of “messengers” in addition to Alley. An important design criterion was to give equal time to clean energy solutions while pulling no punches as to the consensus findings of leading climate scientists. With the ETOM project now completed and final reports submitted to NSF, what results can be shared to inform future efforts? And how did ETOM compare in audience impact with other major media efforts such as Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” or Showtime’s more recent “Years of Living Dangerously”? Results reported draw on the external evaluation by Rockman Et Al, and include both quantitative and qualitative data. Key findings are the importance of including Texan ranchers enthusiastic about wind power alongside Navy Admirals adamant that climate change is human-caused and Marines implementing solar energy to reduce casualties incurred while transporting fossil fuels. In-person presentations by Alley and others at science centers served as de facto focus groups for scripting the TV programs, along with actual focus groups convened by Rockman. The 3rd program, ENERGY QUEST USA, documented 5 quite different communities, from Alaska to Forth Worth, Baltimore, Portland and Kansas, all using competition, local values, and economic incentives to move ahead.

Perhaps, but at the cost of generating materials that have proven potential for long-lived use in both secondary and tertiary education.",

These courses serve as valuable recruiting tools for future geoscience majors because over 55% of geoscience students select their major in the first two years of college (Wilson, 2013).

High impact practices, such as writing courses, student research, and community service can be difficult to integrate into large, non-major courses. Student-produced audio (e. g. podcasts) provide one approach to providing high impact practices within these courses. Other researchers have found student produced audio to be effective at transmitting content, integrating place based experiences, and building community connections within the students. Here I present the implementation of student-created audio within a large (100+), general education course (AST 30 – Mission to the Planets) over the last 4 years called ‘Telescopic Topics.’ Activities scaffold the students through the semester where they select a topic on planetary science, work with the science reference librarian, visit the writing center, and record their podcast at campus student radio station. The top podcasts are then aired on the campus radio station during the news broadcasts through a rotating series. Surveys of student experiences find that student find the activity valuable and engaging. Students reported feeling less intimidated by the science content and more connected to the subject matter.

VAULT2.0 is a Lya (1216Å) spectroheliograph capable of 0.3” (~250 km) spatial resolution. The objective of the VAULT2.0 project is the study of the chromosphere-corona interface. This interface has acquired renewed emphasis over the last few years, thanks to high-resolution observations from Hinode/SOT and EIS instruments and the Lya imaging from the two VAULT flights. The observations have shown that the upper chromosphere may play a more important role in heating the corona and in affecting EUV observations that previously thought: (1) by supplying the mass via Type-II spicules and, (2) by absorbing coronal emission. Many of the required clues for further progress are located in sub-arcsecond structures with temperatures between 10000 and 50000 K, a regime not accessible by Hinode or SDO. Lyman-alpha observations are, therefore, ideal, for filling in this gap.\nThe observing campaign in support of the VAULT2.0 is closely coordinated with the Hinode and IRIS missions to study the mass/energy flow from the chromosphere to the corona with joint observations of type-II spicules, and the magnetic connectivity of coronal loops using the full imaging and spectral capabilities of IRIS, Hinode and SDO. Several ground-based observatories also provide important observations (IBIS, BBSO, SOLIS).\nThe VAULT2.0 project is funded by the NASA LCAS program.",

            "abstract": "Mantle melt depletion is fundamental to stabilization of thick lithospheric mantle and to craton formation and survival. Three potential mechanisms to grow lithospheric mantle are: partial melting of upwelling mantle plumes; imbrication and accretion of oceanic lithosphere at subduction zones; and flux melting of the mantle wedge at volcanic arcs. Stable isotopes can distinguish these models because stable isotopes fractionate substantially at low temperature, making the mantle sensitive to the incorporation of subducted material. Correlations between stable isotopes and trace elements can then distinguish seafloor weathering processes from flux melting processes, allowing subducted oceanic lithosphere to be discerned from flux-melted lithosphere. We find that indices of melt depletion (e.g. cpx Cr#, Yb concentrations and Mg#) in xenoliths from the Colorado Plateau correlate with δ18O values of olivine. Xenoliths from The Thumb volcanic neck have δ18Ool values ranging from +5.05 to +5.50‰ (n=12) that correlate positively with indices of melt depletion, and xenoliths from the Green Knobs diatreme have δ18Ool values that range from +4.85 to +5.36‰ (n=9) and correlate negatively with indices of melt depletion. These trends may reflect coupled fluid input and melt depletion, typical of flux melting. The different trends at each locality may be due to fluxing of different fluids- either high δ18O fluids derived from altered oceanic crust or low δ18O fluids derived from recycled serpentinite. Canil and Lee (2009) interpreted correlations between whole rock δ18O values and MgO/SiO2 in xenoliths from The Thumb to be due to seafloor weathering and Mg loss of abyssal peridotites followed by later accretion of the rocks to the Colorado Plateau lithosphere. However, chrome and alumina are immobile during seafloor weathering, so correlations between δ18O values and Cr# also present in The Thumb xenoliths are inconsistent with seafloor weathering. Evidence for flux melting is consistent with the results of Selverstone et al. (1999), who found that the constituent terranes of the Colorado Plateau are accreted arcs. Stable isotope analyses of older SCLM peridotites may help distinguish lithospheric mantle formation mechanisms in other cratons and constrain the timing of onset of modern plate tectonics.",

            "abstract": "Ambon city of Indonesia is extremely vulnerable to climatic hazards and the frequency of sediment related disasters appears to increase. During 2012 to 2013, more than one hundred of sediment related disasters including landslides occurred especially in the settlement area. The damage was particularly severe in the city and at several sites along the transportation network. The sediment related disasters resulted of hundreds houses destroyed, including 43 deaths, numerous injured people and hundreds people evacuated. Rainfall threshold method is an approach for develop a warning system for sediment related disasters occurence. Two types of rainfall thresholds can be established (Aleotti, 2004): (1) empirical thresholds, based on historic analysis of relationship rainfall/landslide (sediment related disaster) occurrence, and (2) physical thresholds, based on numeric models that take into account the relationship between rainfall, pore pressure and slope stability by coupling hydrologic and stability models. Empirical thresholds were used in this study. Empirical threshold has been considered as collecting rainfall data for sediment related disaster events from 2007 to 2013. The results show that the sediment related disasters occurred in short periods (2 hours) with a high average intensity and longer periods (48 hours) with a lower average intensity. We determined new rainfall thresholds for possible sediment related disaster occurrence with the regression value of I = 83.88D-0.80 (I is rainfall intensity, mm/hr and D is duration, hr). It is expected that the new rainfall thresholds could be used for the development of a warning system in Ambon city.",

            "abstract": "Calderas in the southern Stillwater Range (SSR) and Clan Alpine Mountains (CAM) were formed during the mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flareup and subsequently tilted (40->90°) by large-magnitude extension. New geologic mapping, geochemistry, and 40Ar/39Ar and SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating document 2 periods of magmatism resulting in 4 nested calderas and related granitoid plutons in sections up to 10 km thick. The first period included pre-caldera rhyolite lava domes (30(?) Ma), ~5 km of pre- and post-collapse intermediate lavas and rhyolite tuff that filled the Job Canyon caldera (~29.4 to 28.8 Ma), and the >4-5 km thick, geochemically similar IXL pluton (28.9±0.4 Ma) that intruded the Job Canyon caldera. The second period included pre-caldera rhyolite lava domes and dikes (~25.5 Ma) and 3 ignimbrite units in 3 calderas: tuff of the Louderback Mountains (low-silica rhyolite; ≥600 m thick; ~25.2 Ma); tuff of Poco Canyon (high-silica rhyolite; up to 4.3 km thick; 25.27±0.05 Ma); and ≥2000 km3 tuff of Elevenmile Canyon (trachydacite to rhyolite; up to 4.5 km thick; 25.12±0.01 Ma). The composite Freeman Creek pluton (granite, 24.8±0.4 Ma; granodiorite, 25.0±0.2 Ma) and Chalk Mountain rhyolite porphyry (25.2±0.2 Ma) and granite (24.8±0.3 Ma) plutons intruded the Poco Canyon and Elevenmile Canyon calderas. Early (30 Ma) rhyolites have the least radiogenic compositions (Sri~0.7040), whereas other units are relatively homogeneous (Sri~0.7050, ENd~0.0). Oxygen isotope compositions for SSR and CAM calderas are highly variable (d18Oquartz=5.6-8.2‰, d18Osanidine=5.5-7.0‰, d18Ozircon= 4.1-6.3‰), corresponding to a magmatic range of 5.7-7.9‰. U-Pb dating of zircons indicates homogeneous age populations and few/no xenocrysts and antecrysts. These data show that (1) thick plutons (>2-5 km) underlie compositionally and temporally related caldera-filling ignimbrites, (2) caldera-forming cycles are isotopically variable, requiring divergent magmatic sources in relatively focused (space and time) magmatic episodes, (3) caldera magmas have a strong mantle affinity and overlap isotopically (Sr, Nd, and O) with regional Late Cenozoic basalts, and (4) silicic magmatism replaced the Mesozoic crust to depths >5 to 10 km, radically altering the crustal profile in the western Nevada Great Basin at ~30-25 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Climate change can reasonably be described as a “wicked problem” meaning that it is complex, difficult and multi-faceted, although critical to equitable development and the sustainability of human civilization. But while the Wikipedia definition says such problems are “impossible” to solve, not even to try will lead to certain failure. “Earth: The Operators’ Manual” (ETOM) was an NSF-funded informal science education project with 3 hour-long TV programs appearing on PBS in 2011 and 2012, along with live presentations by series host, Penn State’s Richard Alley, and others at 5 major science centers. Uniquely among climate change programming, ETOM gave equal time to identifying solutions along with climate science, and made all its materials freely available via YouTube. Formal and informal science educators can register to download HD videos for classroom and outreach use, and signups have ranged from middle schools to 4-year colleges. Building on the success of the series and Alley’s companion tradebook of the same name, Penn State working with Coursera invited Alley to develop a MOOC entitled “Energy, The Environment and Our Future” that similarly combined the essential science along with clean energy solutions. The course reached more than 30,000 students in the first semester of 2014. More recently the ETOM team has partnered with the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) to develop “READ for the EARTH,” an NSF EAGER project, offering campuses the opportunity to adopt Alley’s book, the ETOM videos (including “How To Talk To An Ostrich”), NCSE’s\nwww.CAMELclimatechange.org\nweb site and other resources for both formal and informal uses. Some campuses have used the book with honors classes, and some are exploring adapting ETOM as a first year reading experience for all freshman. Our presentation will share reactions to the MOOC, to the pilot phases of “READ for the EARTH” and present both qualitative and quantitative results. Some of the most interesting of the latter include EDA (electrodermal activity) data comparing real-time responses to viewing one of the ETOM videos contrasted with discussion and lecture formats at a university level. Attendees will be invited to participate in “READ” and to utilize the “evergreen” version of the 2014 MOOC through “InTeGrate” (\nwww.serc.carleton.edu/InTeGrate\n.)",

            "abstract": "Ultraslow spreading ridge makes up about 25% of global mid-ocean ridge length. Previous studies believed that hydrothermal activity is not widespread on the ultraslow spreading ridge owing to lower magma supply. Southwest Indian ridge (SWIR) with the spreading rate between 1.2cm/a to 1.4cm/a, represents the ultraslow spreading ridge. In 2007, Chinese Cruise (CC) 19th discovered the Dragon Flag deposit (DFD) on the SWIR, which is the first active hydrothermal field found on the ultraslow spreading ridge. In recent years, over 10 hydrothermal fields have been found on the SWIR between Indomed and Gallieni transform faults by the Chinese team. Tao et al. (2012) implied that the segment sections with excess heat from enhanced magmatism and suitable crustal permeability along slow and ultraslow ridges might be the most promising areas for searching for hydrothermal activities. In 2014, CC 30thdiscovered five hydrothermal fields and several hydrothermal anomalies on the SWIR.\nDragon Horn Area (DHA). The DHA is located on the southern of segment 27 SWIR, with an area of about 400 km2. The geophysical studies indicated that the DHA belongs to the oceanic core complex (OCC), which is widespread on the slow spreading ridges (Zhao et al., 2013). The rocks, such as gabbro, serpentinized peridotite, and consolidated carbonate were collected in the DHA, which provide the direct evidence with the existence of the OCC. However, all rock samples gathered by three TV-grab stations are basalts on the top of the OCC. A hydrothermal anomaly area, centered at 49.66°E，37.80° S with a range of several kms, is detected in the DHA. It is probably comprised of several hydrothermal fields and controlled by a NW fault.\nNew discovery of hydrothermal fields. From January to April 2014, five hydrothermal fields were discovered on the SWIR between 48°E to 50°E during the leg 2&3 of the CC 30th, which are the Su Causeway field (48.6°E, 38.1°S), Bai Causeway field (48.8°E, 37.9 °S), Dragon Well West field (49.6°E, 37.8°S), Dragon Well East field (49.8°E, 37.8°S), and Landing Stage field (51.0°E, 37.5°S), respectively.",

            "abstract": "The Oil Sand Region (OSR) of North-Central Alberta exists within the sub-humid Boreal Plains (BP) ecozone, with a slight long-term moisture deficit regime. Despite this deficit, the BP is comprised of productive wetland and mixed wood (aspen and conifer dominated) forests. Reclamation activities are now underway at a large number of surface mining operations in the OSR, where target ecosystems are identified, soil prescriptions placed and commercial forest species planted. Some watersheds have been created that now contain wetlands. However, recent work in the BP suggests that over time wetlands supply moisture for the productivity of upland forests. Thus, water use of reclaimed forests is going to be critical in determining the sustainability of these systems and adjacent wetlands, and whether in time, either will achieve some form of equivalent capability that will allow for certification by regulators.\nA critical component in the success of any reclamation is that sufficient water is available to support target ecosystems through the course of natural climate cycles in the region. Water Use Efficiency (WUE), which links photosynthesis (GEP) with water use (Evapotranspiration (ET)), provides a useful metric to compare ecosystems and evaluate their utilization of resources. In this study, 41 site years of total growing season water and carbon flux data over 8 sites (4 reclamation, 4 regeneration) were evaluated using eddy covariance micrometeorological towers. WUE shows clear discrimination among ecosystem types as aspen stands assimilate more carbon per unit weight of water than conifers. WUEs also change with time as ecosystems become more effective at transpiring water through plant pathways compared with bare-soil evaporation, which allows an assessment of ability to limit water loss without carbon uptake. In addition, clonal rooting systems allow aspen forests to recover quicker after disturbance than reclamation sites in terms of their WUE. For reclamation sites, there is considerable variability in GEP and ET associated with vegetation establishment, with enhanced ET losses over-riding any significant changes in C uptake, suggesting that long-term mine water management must consider ecosystem pathways if down-gradient wetlands and end-pit lakes are to be sustained.",

            "abstract": "The spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity K highly influences flow and solute transport in the subsurface. The estimation of the spatial distribution of K in heterogeneous aquifers with an adequate resolution and support scale is therefore one of the major challenges in hydrogeology and still seems to be unsolved. Even though direct measurements of K with modern methods reveal the distribution with typically high vertical resolutions, they still are scarce and local. Therefore, K is mostly inferred from measurements of quantities depending on K, such as hydraulic heads monitored during hydraulic tests and tracer test data. Conventional approaches, such as the type-curve approach for pumping tests, fail in estimating the spatial distribution of K, since they are based on the assumption of homogeneity. Even if data from multi-well pumping tests are analyzed, they always will yield different effective parameters. In contrast, tomographic techniques originally derived for geophysical surveying can be transferred to hydraulic applications and are much better suitable to derive K distributions. In this presentation, we will show results of the project “Tomographic Methods in Hydrogeology” in which we focused on the development of geostatistical methods for the inversion of tomographic data sets of different types (hydraulic testing, heat and ERT-monitoring of salt tracer tests) and the development and improvement of such experimental techniques. Based on selected examples we will present our developments related to the joint geostatistical inversion of tomographic data sets, its efficient parallelization, and its application to a 3D-inversion of tomographic thermal tracer tests. Related to the acquisition of tomographic data sets, we discuss different aspects of the field application of hydraulic tomography, the development of tracer-tomographic methods using heat as tracer, and efficient salt-tracer techniques with a ERT-based salt-tracer monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The productivity of Amazon rainforest is constrained by the availability of nutrients, in particular phosphorus (P). Deposition of transported African dust in boreal winter and spring is considered an important nutrient input for the Amazon Basin, though its magnitude is not well qunatified. This study provides a remote sensing observation-based estimate of dust deposition in the Amazon Basin using a 7-year (2007-2013) record of three dimensional (3D) distributions of aerosol in both cloud-free and above-cloud conditions from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). It is estimated that the 7-year average of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin amounts to 15.1 ~ 32.1 Tg a-1 (Tg = 1012 g). This imported dust could provide 0.012 ~ 0.025 Tg P a-1 or equivalent to 12 ~ 26 g P ha-1 a-1 to fertilize the Amazon rainforest, which largely compensates the hydrological loss of P. The CLAIOP-based estimate agrees better with estimates from in-situ measurements and model simulations than what has been reported in literature. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and inclusion of meridional dust transport calculation in addition to the 3D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. The trans-Atlantic transport and deposition of dust shows strong interannual variations that are found to correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation index in the winter season and anticorrelate with the prior-year Sahel Precipitation Index on an annual basis. Uncertainties associated with the estimate will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The accuracy and comparability of airborne hygrometers remains under debate often only reaching ±10% under static lab conditions or even >±30% in flight. This often limits atmospheric models as well as other species sensors which need to be corrected for water vapor dilution or cross sensitivity. Further challenges come from the huge dynamic range (2–40000 ppmv), the strong spatial gradients (up to several 1000 ppmv/s). and the difficult and error-prone calibration processes, very often without any direct links to the accurate global metrological water vapor scales, which are defined via national primary humidity generators.\nTo fill this gap and provide “traceable”, i.e. metrologically validated, airborne hygrometers we developed the Selective Extractive Airborne Laser Diode Hygrometer, SEALDH, which uses dTDLAS with a special, calibration-free data evaluation to circumvent the need for frequent field calibrations and to ensure high accuracy and comparability by a holistic data quality assurance concept in combination with extensive metrological validations at national primary standards. Thus SEALDH-II can be used in a calibration-free field sensor mode (with an absolute, metrologically defined uncertainty of 4.3% +- 3ppmv). The response time is mainly limited by the gas flow and significantly below 1 sec, yielding precision down to 0.08 ppmv (1σ, 1sec) measured at 600 ppmv and 1000 hPa. Its excellent long-term stability, <1% over 18 months, and the metrologically validated range from 5 to 30 000 ppmv makes it also well suited as a hygrometric field transfer standard. SEALDH-II has been recently operated without any failures for over 50 hours on several airborne science missions (DENCHAR, AIRTOSS-I, and AIRTOSS-II). In addition SEALDH participated in the representative, international comparison AquaVIT‑II.\nThe performance during these missions and the value of a traceability will be demonstrated and discussed.",

            "abstract": "As zones of focused metamorphism, melting, and ductile deformation, hot crustal sections are especially important for understanding the evolution of the lower crust in convergent orogens, such as Tibet. One of the best exposed crustal sections that reached ultrahigh-temperature (UHT: >900° C) is in southern Madagascar. There, the association of UHT mineral assemblages with exceptionally high concentrations of radioactive heat-producing elements begs the question of whether radiogenic heating caused UHT. Partial melting, retrogression and rapid elemental diffusion at high temperature, however, have left a complex record of radiometric dates that span 150 Myr (~650–500 Ma), making it difficult to address this question.\nWe apply laser-ablation split-stream ICPMS (LASS) petrochronology and 4+ cation thermometry to better constrain the lengthscales and timescales over which high temperatures were sustained in southern Madagascar. By deciphering complex intragrain (re)crystallization textures of zircon and monazite from a broad geographical area, we deduce that orogenesis lasted >60 Myr. Specifically, 600–540 Ma zircon and monazite with HREE depletion suggest (re)crystallization in the presence of garnet. All monazite show negative Eu anomalies (compatible with the presence of plagioclase), but ~570 to ~530 Ma monazite has more-pronounced anomalies. Ti-in-zircon and Zr-in-rutile thermometry confirm ultrahigh temperatures within a restricted area of ~100 x 200 km.\nThese thermal and chronologic constraints allow us to evaluate the potential causes of heating. Measured K, Th, and U contents of rocks within the UHT domain indicate an average heat-production rate of >4 μW/m3, sufficient to produce UHT metamorphism in 60-km thick crust within 60 Myr. We conclude that high concentrations of heat-producing elements caused focused heat production in young metasedimentary rocks that were sandwiched between older crustal domains. We speculate that ultrahigh temperatures caused by radiogenic heating led to preferential crustal melting within—and ductile extrusion of—the young metasediments.",

            "abstract": "Researchers often invoke variations in water content, stress state, and melt distribution to account for the observed variety of olivine crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs). Since the average direction of [100] axes directly affects seismic anisotropy, there is potential to link observed anisotropy to compositional and thermo-mechanical conditions. It is well established that the (010)[100] is the weakest slip system, and therefore thought to control CPOs, in dry olivine at P < 2 GPa. However, CPOs formed in experiments on olivine plus mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) reveal a fabric in which [001] axes form weak point maxima parallel to the shear direction, and [010] axes form strong point maxima perpendicular to the shear plane, indicative of (010)[001] as the weak slip system.\nTo investigate the mechanisms that cause this change in CPO, samples fabricated from fine-grained San Carlos olivine plus MORB were deformed in torsion at T = 1200°C and P = 300 MPa. Samples with starting melt fractions of 0.01, 0.10 and 0.25 were sheared to a maximum strain of γ ≈ 13.\nWe investigate three hypotheses. 1) The easiest slip direction changes from [100] to [001] in partially molten rocks. However, no microstructural evidence for such a change has been found. 2) With the presence of a melt phase, shape preferred orientations (SPOs) play an important role in fabric development. We test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between SPOs and CPOs as a function of strain and melt content. 3) Anisotropy in the melt distribution leads to anisotropy in grain-boundary sliding, thus preferentially favoring grain rotations necessary to produce the observed fabric. We test this hypothesis by detailed analysis of misorientations between neighboring grains. Our results will provide a crucial link between seismic anisotropy and grain-scale deformation processes.",

            "abstract": "Deep saline fracture fluids have been found in billion year old rocks throughout the Precambrian shields of Canada, Fennoscandia and South Africa - geologic terrains that make up more than 70% of the Earth’s continental crust. Dissolved gases in these fluids are dominated by methane and higher hydrocarbons, some of the most radiogenic noble gas signatures ever reported, and up to mM concentrations of H2, making these environments as H2-rich as marine hydrothermal vents and spreading centers. Although the discovery of microbial ecosystems sustained by H2-producing water-rock reactions in the deep ocean vents transformed thinking about where life may have originated on Earth and the search for life on other worlds, such as Europa, the billion year old rocks of Precambrian shields have been under-investigated to date as analogs.\nNoble gas studies have provided a range of residence times from millions to tens of millions of years for the subsurface fracture fluids in South Africa. Holland et al. (2013) reported residence times of more than a billion years for fracture waters from 2.4 km depth from mines in Northern Canada – revealing an ancient previously unexplored hydrosphere[1]. Analyses of the DNA, RNA and amino acids from some of these fracture waters reveal an active biosphere supported by chemolithoautotrophs that alters the stable isotopic composition of C, N, and S aqueous and gaseous species. The discovery that ancient fluid environments capable of supporting life can remain isolated for up to billions of years in the Precambrian crust changes our understanding of the extent of the Earth’s crust, and by inference Mars’ crust, that may be habitable, and the role that such potential buried biomes play in preserving, evolving and propagating life on planetary timescales. Mars, like the Precambrian shields on Earth, is dominated by tectonically quiescent geologic terrains which are billions of years old, some with serpentinized ultramafic rocks capable of sustaining production of reduced gases. If such ancient fluids, with mM concentrations of H2 and CH4, are preserved deep in the terrestrial crust on Ga time scales, similar potential buried biomes may be preserved at depth in the subsurface of Mars.

            "abstract": "Here we describe the recent occurrence of a notch or localized region of reduced ice cover in the winter marginal ice zone offshore of the Kangerdlugssuaq Fiord, the site of the largest tidewater glacier along Greenland’s southeast coast. We will argue that the development of this notch is the result of the topographically controlled inflow of warm subtropical water, that began in the mid 1990s, along the submarine trough that connects the fiord to the deep ocean. We will also show that there is considerable inter-annual variability on the 2-8 year time scale in sea ice cover in the vicinity of the notch, This variability is associated with a seesaw in surface temperature between southeast and northeast Greenland suggesting that it may play a role in modulating the regional climate potentially affecting the ice sheet’s outlet glaciers. The dominant atmospheric signal associated with this variability is a dipole in the sea-level pressure across the Nordic Seas with poles associated with the Icelandic and Lofoten Lows. The strength of this dipole is independent of the state of the NAO suggesting that one needs to consider the variability identified in this paper as well that of the NAO when attempting to understand the atmosphere’s role in ocean-fiord interactions along the southeast coast of Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Rifting and the subsequent breakup of continental lithosphere has given rise to the magma-poor Galicia Bank rifted margin in the North Atlantic Ocean. Hyperextension of continental crust is observed at the deep Galicia margin (west of Spain) and has been accommodated by the rotation of continental fault blocks, which are underlain by the S-reflector, an interpreted detachment fault, which has exhumed serpentinized mantle peridotite. West of these features is the enigmatic Peridotite Ridge (PR) which has been suggested to delimit the western extent of the ocean-continent transition. An outstanding question at this margin is where unequivocal oceanic crust begins, with little existing data to constrain this boundary.\nWe present results from a 160-km-long wide-angle seismic profile, which encompasses the S-reflector to the east, the PR, and the unidentified basement west of the PR. This profile consists of 32 OBS/H recording wide angle seismic data from coincident multichannel seismic surveying. First-arrival travel time tomography models of the crustal velocity structure were produced using two algorithms, with the best fit model having a RMS travel time misfit of 38ms, a χ2 of 0.99 and strong correlation with the structure observed in seismic reflection images. East of the PR, the 3.0-3.5 kms-1 velocity contours match top of crust and the S-reflector generally lies between the 6.0-6.5 kms-1 velocity contours, giving a crustal thickness of 1.5-3.5 km and an average velocity gradient of 0.75 s-1. Similarly, west of the PR we observe a basement layer which is 2.0-4.0 km thick and has an average velocity gradient of 0.72 s-1. High velocity gradients, an absence of velocities typical of oceanic layer 3 and no clear mantle reflections suggest the continued presence of exhumed, serpentinized mantle peridotite west of the PR, which could be analogous to the large expanses of mantle peridotite exposed at the seafloor on the flanks of the ultra-slow Southwest Indian ridge.",

Studies that have investigated the environmental and physiological drivers of δ18O values in tree ring cellulose have typically focused either on the source of the signal, e.g. the leaf and the water therein, or on the sink, e.g. the cellulose in the stem. In contrast, hardly any research has investigated the transfer of the δ18O signal from precipitation, to soil water, xylem water, leaf water, leaf sugars, phloem sugars all the way to cellulose in the tree ring. As such, critical uncertainties remain regarding the seasonal integration and precision by which precipitation and leaf water δ18O signals are recorded in the tree ring cellulose δ18O values. In our talk, we will present a unique three year dataset that shows the seasonal variation of δ18O values in precipitation, soil water, xylem water, leaf water, leaf sugars, twig and stem phloem sugars for four common European tree species, which are growing in a mature temperature Swiss mixed broadleaf/evergreen forest. This dataset allows us to assess, (i) to what degree the substantial seasonal variation in precipitation δ18O values influences the δ18O values of tree ring cellulose and (ii) if physiological and environmental δ18O signals imprinted on the tree’s leaf water δ18O values and the assimilates formed therein are altered on their way downstream to the tree stem. The new insight that we provide into the integration and possible alteration of δ18O signals along the leaf-stem pathway will contribute significantly to a better understanding of the environmental and physiological signals that can be obtained from tree ring δ18O chronologies. In addition it will be relevant for the incorporation and parameterization of tree ring isotope models into dynamic global vegetation models.",

With issues in the geosciences such as; being the least diverse of all major STEM fields, an increasing number of retiring geoscientists, and a projected geoscience job growth not matching the number of geoscience graduates, the geoscience community needs to look at community colleges as a solution to these issues. A key factor for students entering and excelling in the geoscience is the opportunity for formative undergraduate field experiences. Formative field experiences go beyond one-day field excursions by incorporating field projects, interactive learning, and community building between participants in regions students are unfamiliar with. Unfortunately, these types of formative experiences often require logistics and resources that are not available or known to community college faculty. In order to build a framework for implementing formative field experiences by community colleges a two-week “field exchange” between two community colleges with different geological, social, and cultural settings was conducted. Supported with a supplemental grant from NSF, the “Border to Beltway” program provided 11 students from El Paso Community College and another 13 from Northern Virginia Community College with two one-week regional geology field trips: First, to West Texas in March 2014, and second, to the mid-Atlantic region in May 2014. Students were selected based on academic standing, non-traditional (minority, female, over 35, veteran) status, and interest in geology. Qualitative data collected from participants regarding the implementation of the field exchange include; student perception of geology before and after exchange, challenges students faced in the field or traveling for the first time, quantity and quality of projects given, and working with others from different backgrounds. Data regarding planning, logistics, budget, and implementation were also compiled by the instructors to help identify components for a successful formative field experience or exchange at a community college.",

            "abstract": "The observation and monitoring of solar irradiance, in general, and UV (Ultra Violet) irradiance, in particular, is important due to its impact on human health and environment on regional and global scale. The UV irradiance, hence, the UV index (UVI), is affected by various atmospheric parameters, e.g., the solar zenith angle, the ozone overhead column and other atmospheric absorbers and scatters such as clouds and aerosols.\nIn order to investigate the modifications induced on human environment due to the UV irradiance, it is important to quantify the various factors affecting the UV irradiance, both UV-A and UV-B. Particularly, clouds are responsible for a great deal of the observed irradiance variability that in turn requires the examination of extensive observation data sets by detailed radiative transfer models using co-located meteorological and ozone measurements together with satellite based estimations.\nThese factors are continuously monitored over Uccle, Belgium, since 1993 by means of station based observations producing spectral measurements of UV irradiance together with UVI computation that constitutes the European UV network. Today there are six stations representing Belgium in this European network. These measurements give a good insight into the trend of UV irradiance and associated atmospheric parameters over Belgium. Here we present some of the recent results from these measurements and radiative transfer modelling, e.g., the relation between the cloudiness, uncertainty in the cloudiness due to measurements, and UVI, ozone trend and UVI, among others. It is seen that since 2000 despite of a stable ozone concentration UV irradiance continues to increase. Modelling studies show that 1% of ozone reduction implies 2% of UVB increase.\nThese station based measurement data will be used to study solar irradiance – cloud - aerosol interactions by merging them with satellite based measurements.",

            "abstract": "The GC600 hydrocarbon seep is located at 1200 m in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Satellite data show it to be one of the most prolific sources of natural oil slicks in the entire GOM. We mapped its seafloor oil and gas vents with 3-D seismic, swath-bathymetry acoustics and submersible observations, documenting gas hydrate deposits, brine pools, benthic fauna, and authigenic carbonates. Geophysical profiles show subbottom locations of salt bodies and migration conduits. We deployed time-lapse imaging systems focused on individual vents to quantify release rates. Oil and gas flow upward along the flanks of an allochthonous salt body from source rocks at 10,000 m and migrate to the seafloor from faults emanating from the salt. Venting to the water column and surface consists of oily bubbles and occurs in two fields separated by ~1 km. The NW vent field (Megaplume) appears to be a more recent expression and hosts about three highly active vents; while the SE vent field (Birthday Candles) hosts more than 10 vents that are generally slower. We measured discharge rates of 2.6 cm3 s-1 and Megaplume and 0.09 cm3 s-1 at Birthday Candles. Although surface deposits of gas hydrate were evident at both vent fields, the Birthday Candles area featured dozens of conical mounds formed by gas hydrate that were dark brown due to large amounts of liquid oil perfused throughout the deposits. Large brine pools indicated gas hydrate formation at the seafloor. Venting occurred in horizontal fissures on the mounds, in which oil and hydrate combined to form short-lived chimneys and balloon-like structures. Ice worms (Hesiocaeca methanicola) were extremely abundant in burrows extending from the sediment into the gas hydrate. Proceeding farther to the SE, venting is reduced and absent, but surface carbonate deposits suggest relict gas hydrate mounds. We propose that the NW to SE trend at GC600 encompasses the progressive development of a biogeochemical filter that sequesters and mineralizes a very substantial portion of the source hydrocarbon prior to discharge into the water column.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture data is critical for accurate drought prediction, flood forecasting, climate modeling, prediction of crop yields and water budgeting. However, soil moisture data are collected by many agencies and organizations in the United States using a variety of instruments and methods for varying applications. These data are often distributed and represented in disparate formats, posing significant challenges for use. In recognition of these challenges, the President’s Climate Action Plan articulated the need for a coordinated national soil moisture network.\nIn response to this action plan, a team led by the National Integrated Drought Information System has begun to develop a framework for this network and has instituted a proof-of-concept pilot study. This pilot is located in the south-central plains of the US, and will serve as a reference architecture for the requisite data systems and inform the design of the national network. The pilot comprises both in-situ and modeled soil moisture datasets (historical and real-time) and will serve the following use cases: operational drought monitoring, experimental land surface modeling, and operational hydrological modeling.\nThe pilot will be implemented using a distributed network design in order to serve dispersed data in real-time directly from data providers. Standard service protocols will be used to enable future integration with external clients. The pilot network will additionally contain a catalog of data sets and web service endpoints, which will be used to broker web service calls. A mediation and aggregation service will then intelligently request, compile, and transform the distributed datasets from their native formats into a standardized output. This mediation framework allows data to be hosted and maintained locally by the data owners while simplifying access through a single service interface. These data services will then be used to create visualizations, for example, views of the current soil moisture conditions compared to historical baselines via a map-based web application. This talk will comprise an overview of the pilot design and implementation, a discussion of strategies for integrating in-situ and modeled soil moisture data sets as well as lessons learned during the course of the pilot.",

            "abstract": "Most of the sedimentary basins around SE Asia were formed during Late Cretaceous to present. Previous studies suggested that Sundaland is a stable core in SE Asia that experienced the interaction of 4 major plates (Eurasia, India, Pacific and Australia plates). Although the plate tectonic history is very complicated, most of the sedimentary basins developed under the extensional regime. In Cenozoic, there are at least two contractional and four extensional events can be identified in this regime. The first contractional event is India plate colliding with Eurasia in Early Eocene, which propagated to the northern part of Sundaland and made Indochina block escape southeastward into the present-day South China Sea. The second one was in Early Miocene where Australia plate, along with many micro-continental blocks, drifted northward and collided with Sundaland that generated inversions in SE Sundaland. On the other hands, four marginal basins have their sea-floor spreading in Cenozoic, namely South China Sea (30-16Ma), Sulu Sea (17-12Ma), Celebes Sea (49-35Ma) and Andaman Sea (20-5Ma), that caused the sedimentary facies in the basins changing from mainly terrigenous to partially marine. In order to understand the evolutionary history of sedimentary basins and their relationship with plate tectonics, we used Gplates program to reconstruct SE Asia from Late Mesozoic to present. About 25 isopaches of major sedimentary basins were compiled into the program. So far, we can conclude that the key rifting event of the sedimentary basins were stared from Early Eocene that could be correlated with the India-Eurasia collision.",

            "abstract": "Strong multiples were observed in marine seismic data of Los Angeles Regional Seismic Experiment (LARSE).It is crucial to eliminate these multiples in conventional ray-based or one-way wave-equation based depth image methods. As long as multiples contain information of target zone along travelling path, it’s possible to use them as signal, to improve the illumination coverage thus enhance the image quality of structural boundaries. Reverse time migration including multiples is a two-way wave-equation based prestack depth image method that uses both primaries and multiples to map structural boundaries. Several factors, including source wavelet, velocity model, back ground noise, data acquisition geometry and preprocessing workflow may influence the quality of image. The source wavelet is estimated from direct arrival of marine seismic data. Migration velocity model is derived from integrated model building workflow, and the sharp velocity interfaces near sea bottom needs to be preserved in order to generate multiples in the forward and backward propagation steps. The strong amplitude, low frequency marine back ground noise needs to be removed before the final imaging process. High resolution reverse time image sections of LARSE Lines 1 and Line 2 show five interfaces: depth of sea-bottom, base of sedimentary basins, top of Catalina Schist, a deep layer and a possible pluton boundary. Catalina Schist shows highs in the San Clemente ridge, Emery Knoll, Catalina Ridge, under Catalina Basin on both the lines, and a minor high under Avalon Knoll. The high of anticlinal fold in Line 1 is under the north edge of Emery Knoll and under the San Clemente fault zone. An area devoid of any reflection features are interpreted as sides of an igneous plume.",

            "abstract": "The axial melt lens (AML) is a steady-state magma-rich body located at the dyke-gabbro transition at intermediate- and fast-spreading ridges. It is widely believed to be the reservoir from which mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) is erupted. The paradox of the axial melt lens is that the plutonic rocks that occur at this level are far too evolved to be in equilibrium with MORB, which is basaltic by definition; hence, the plutonic and volcanic records do not match. We explore this paradox by study of the first comprehensive sample suite of the uppermost plutonics of a fast-spreading ridge, taken by remotely-operated vehicle from the Hess Deep rift during cruise JC21. 23 samples (8 dolerites, 14 gabbronorites, and 1 gabbro) were collected from a section containing the transition from the uppermost gabbroic section into sheeted dykes. We present the results of a detailed petrographic and microanalytical investigation of these samples. They are dominated by evolved, varitextured (both in hand sample and thin section) oxide gabbronorites; olivine occurs in only one sample. A preponderance of the samples have positive Eu/Eu* and Sr/Sr*, indicating a cumulate origin. However, the minerals have evolved compositions, and are in equilibrium with melts significantly more evolved than East Pacific Rise MORB. Furthermore, the trace element contents of clinopyroxene differ significantly from clinopyroxene in equilibrium with MORB, being more enriched in incompatible elements.\nTo account for both the evidence of derivation of MORB from the AML and the evolved nature of its rock record, we posit that the AML must be fed by melts on two different timescales: continual low-volume feeding by evolved interstitial melt from the cumulus pile below is augmented episodically by delivery of high volumes of more primitive melt. The latter episodes may trigger eruptions; hence the primitive melts are held in the magma chamber for only short periods, and erupt on the seafloor before significant crystallisation in the AML has taken place. This model for the feeding of the AML provides ample opportunity for mixing between the relatively primitive melts and the evolved, trace-element-rich melt, and accounts for the observed over-enrichment in incompatible elements of MORB.",

            "abstract": "A quiet revolution is taking place in ocean observations; in the last decade new multi-platform, integrated ocean observatories have been progressively implemented by forward looking countries with ocean borders of economic and strategic importance. These systems are designed to fill significant gaps in our knowledge of the ocean state and ocean variability, through long-term, science and society-led, ocean monitoring. These ocean observatories are now delivering results, not the headline results of a single issue experiment, but carefully and systematically improving our knowledge of ocean variability, and thereby, increasing model forecast skill and our ability to link physical processes to ecosystem response.\nHere we present the results from a 3-year quasi-continuous glider monitoring of a key circulation ‘choke’ point in the Western Mediterranean, undertaken by SOCIB (Balearic Islands Coastal Ocean Observing and Forecasting System). For the first time data from the high frequency glider sampling show variations in the transport volumes of water over timescales of days to weeks, as large as those previously only identifiable as seasonal or eddy driven. Although previous surveys noted high cruise-to-cruise variability, they were insufficient to show that in fact water volumes exchanged through this narrow ‘choke’ point fluctuate on ‘weather’ timescales. Using the glider data to leverage an 18-year record of ship missions, we define new seasonal cycles for the exchange of watermasses, challenging generally held assumptions. The pattern of the exchange is further simplified through the characterisation of 5 circulation modes and the defining of a new seasonal cycle for the interplay between mesoscale and basin scale dynamics.\nRestricted ‘choke points’ between our ocean basins are critical locations to monitor water transport variability, as they constrain the inter-basin exchange of heat, salt and nutrients. At the Ibiza Channel 'choke' point, the exchange of watermass is known to affect local ecosystems, including the spawning grounds of commercially important fish stocks, at a biodiversity hotspot. This new insight will be vital in improving our ocean model forecast skill and in the development of integrated ocean products for society.",

            "abstract": "Circumpolar boreal forests contain one third of the terrestrial carbon stores, and it has been shown that they are already affected by climate change. As temperature and precipitation regimes shift, the total biomass and species composition may change in ways that promote further warming on the regional level through atmosphere-vegetation feedbacks. Changes in vegetation cover and the resulting atmosphere-vegetation feedbacks may be the determining factors in how regional terrestrial carbon stores change with climate change. This project reports on the development of a new spatially-explicit individual-based gap model SibBorK that can be utilized to investigate the potential changes in biomass and species composition in the Siberian boreal forest over the coming decades and centuries.\nSibBorK tracks the establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees on 0.01-ha plots within a 9-ha simulation area. The new model is based on the principles of the ZELIG vegetation model, implemented in Python to facilitate interface with geographic information systems for explicit modeling of vegetation across artificial and real terrain. SibBorK was trained on modal (actual) regional forestry yield tables for southern taiga region of central Siberia. The model was calibrated and tested against the regional forestry yield tables, and further tested against an independent dataset from a forest inventory. Model comparisons were made on monospecies and mixed species stands, and included the evaluation of total stand biomass, species-specific biomass, species composition, and stem density based on site index and terrain elevation. Additionally, species distribution along altitudinal gradients and total biomass for specific locations was independently tested against other published forest inventory values. SibBorK is particularly good at predicting biomass and species composition on poor soils, with Orlov site indices III-V, which dominate the Siberian landscape. Herein, SibBorK is used to explore species distribution along soil quality and altitudinal gradients, as well as slope aspects within a complex terrain. SibBorK is further employed in a climate sensitivity analysis.",

            "abstract": "Government funding is the cornerstone of modern science. But with declining investment in science across most of the Western World, a major challenge for society is where best to place what little resource we have. Which research questions should have the greatest priority? Nowhere are these issues more pressing than in the Antarctic, where bases have and continue to play host to ‘big-science’, multi-year programmes of research, locking up logistical support and costs. But in a warming world, the areas with the greatest effects of climate change aren’t always near government research stations.\nWith this in mind, in 2012 a plan was formed to visit Commonwealth Bay, a remote area off the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, where in 2010, an iceberg the size of Rhode Island, known as B09B, dramatically knocked a 60-mile long tongue of ice off the Mertz Glacier into the Southern Ocean, setting off a cascade of change. Inspired by the expeditions of the past, we advertised berths for sale to take citizen scientists south with us, harnessing their interest, experience and investment. People responded far and wide. We were oversubscribed, and the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 was born. With the Russian-owned MV Akademik Shokalskiy as the expedition vessel, we set out south from the New Zealand port of Bluff in late November 2013. During our journey south and on the ice we undertook a number of scientific firsts for the region actively engaging the volunteer scientists on board in projects ranging from oceanography, biology, ecology, geology and glaciaology. The expedition demostrated how private funding could support targeted programmes of research and communicate it to the wider world. Small-science research can capture the public’s imagination and also reap real scientific outputs. Although it is a funding model developed in the Antarctic a hundred years ago, the beauty is it can applied anywhere in the world.",

This means that Mars will be enveloped by the outer parts of the cometary coma which consists of neutral gases, mostly water and associated molecules. Some percentage of this gas is being continually ionized thus creating a cometary ion tail which will also intersect with Mars. The amount of gas and plasma interacting with Mars depends on the production rate of gas as it sublimates from the cometary nucleus (the cometary “activity”). This activity is still uncertain but based on the most recent observations it is plausible that the amount of inflowing plasma will be temporarily comparable to the amount from a large solar storm. This means that the martian induced magnetosphere will be significantly distorted from its baseline configuration. It also means that the inflowing cometary plasma will temporarily enhance the atmospheric escape from the martian atmosphere. We will present observations by the magnetometer on MAVEN during the comet’s passage and discuss the physical implications of the observations for the comet’s effect on the martian magnetosphere.",

Io's aurora was monitored over a full variation cycle of the Jovian magnetic field to map the temporal behavior of the bright auroral spots. The aurora oscillates around the equator roughly in correlation with the time-variable orientation of the local magnetic field of Jupiter. Magnetic field perturbations near Io measured by the Galileo spacecraft were proposed to originate from induction in an electrically conductive global magma ocean. If magnetic induction modifies Io's local magnetic field environment, it will also alter the time-variable morphology of the aurora. We analyze the observed aurora variability and compare it to theoretically predicted spot morphologies for different magma ocean properties. Additionally, we compare the global O and S aurora morphology and brightness in the new observations to a large set of previous STIS images taken over a decade ago between 1997 and 2001 and investigate long-term changes of Io's neutral and plasma environment.",

            "abstract": "Over 100,000 students obtain a bachelor's degree in education every year; these students most commonly encounter the geosciences through a general education course, and it may be the only geoscience course they ever take. However, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) contain much more Earth science content than previous standards. In addition, the NGSS emphasize the use of science and engineering practices in the K-12 classroom. Future teachers need to experience learning science as a scientist, through a hands-on, activity-based learning process, in order to give them the skills they need to teach science that same way in the future. In order to be successful at teaching the NGSS, both current and future teachers will need more than a single course in geoscience or science methods. As a result, there is now a key opportunity for geoscience programs to play a vital role in strengthening teacher preparation programs, both through introductory courses and beyond.\nTo help programs and individual faculty take advantage of this opportunity, we have developed a set of web-based resources, informed by participants in the InTeGrate program as well as by faculty in exemplary teacher preparation programs. The pages address the program-level task of creating engaging and effective courses for teacher preparation programs, with the goal of introducing education majors to the active pedagogies and geoscience methods they will later use in their own classrooms. A collection of exemplary Teacher Preparation programs is also included. Additional pages provide information on what it means to be an “expert thinker” in the geosciences and how individual faculty and teachers can explicitly teach these valuable skills that are reflected in the science and engineering practices of the NGSS.\nLearn more on the InTeGrate web site about preparing future teachers: serc.carleton.edu/integrate/programs/teacher_prep.html\nand training expert thinkers: serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/expert_thinkers.html",

CATS will be mounted on the Japanese Experiment Module's Exposed Facility and will provide near-continuous, altitude-resolved measurements of clouds and aerosols in the Earth’s atmosphere. The ISS orbit path provides a unique opportunity to capture the full diurnal cycle of cloud and aerosol development and transport, allowing for studies that are not possible with the lidar aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, which flies in the sun-synchronous A-Train orbit.\nOne of the primary objectives of CATS is to continue the CALIPSO data record to provide continuity of aerosol and cloud lidar observations during the transition from CALIPSO to EarthCARE. To accomplish this, the CATS project at GSFC and the CALIPSO project at NASA’s Langley Research Center are closely collaborating to develop and deliver a full suite of CALIPSO-like level 2 data products generated from the newly acquired CATS level 1B data. Now in its eighth year of on-orbit operations, the CALIPSO project has developed a robust set of mature and well-validated science algorithms to retrieve the spatial and optical properties of clouds and aerosols from multi-wavelength lidar backscatter signal. By leveraging both new and existing NASA technical resources, this joint effort by the CATS-CALIPSO team will enable rapid delivery of high-quality lidar data sets to the user community at the earliest possible opportunity. In this work we outline the development of the CALIPSO- CATS level 2 software and data products and describe the modifications made to the input CATS data stream and the CALIPSO processing algorithms in order to successfully interface two disparate data processing systems. We use simulated CATS level 1B data to provide an initial assessment of CALIPSO-like CATS level 2 data quality, and highlight those areas where the CALIPSO-like analyses of the CATS multi-beam measurements are likely to contribute to improved understanding of cloud and aerosol interactions, transport and formation processes.",

            "abstract": "Surface/groundwater interactions are an important, but poorly understood, facet of mountain hydrology. We utilize ground electrical resistivity data as a key tool for mapping groundwater pathways and aquifers. However, surface resistivity profiling is limited in both spatial extent and depth, especially in mountainous headwater environments because of inaccessibility and terrain. Because this important groundwater recharge environment is poorly understood, WyCEHG has focused efforts to increase knowledge about the dynamics and location of groundwater recharge. Currently, traditional hydrologic measurements estimate that only 10% of annual snowmelt enters the groundwater system while the rest is immediately available to surface flow. The Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG) collected a 40 sq. km survey of helicopter transient electromagnetic (HTEM) and aeromagnetic data during the fall of 2013 as the first step in a “top down” geophysical characterization of a mountainous headwater catchment in the Snowy Range, Wyoming. Furthermore, mountain springs in the Snowy Range suggests that the “groundwatershed” acts as both a sink and source to surface watersheds. HTEM data show horizontal electrical conductors at depth, which are currently interpreted as fluid-filled subsurface fractures. Because these fractures eventually connect to the surface, they could be geophysical evidence of connectivity between the watershed and “groundwatershed.” However, current HTEM inversion techniques assume a layered homogenous subsurface model, which directly contradicts two characteristics of the Snowy Range: the subvertical bedding of the Cheyenne Belt and heterogeneous distribution of surface water. Ground electrical resistivity surveys and surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements collected during the summer of 2014 target these anomalies to determine their validity and further understand the complicated dynamic of surface and groundwater flow.",

            "abstract": "This presentation examines the sources of uncertainty for the Forced Diffusion (FD) chamber soil respiration (Rs) measurement technique, and demonstrates a protocol for uncertainty quantification that could be appropriate with any soil flux technique. Here, we sought to quantify and compare the three primary sources of uncertainty in Rs: (1) instrumentation error, (2) scaling error, defined as spatial variability of Rs across an ecosystem, and (3) random error, defined as the temporal variability of Rs at a single location, under a narrow temperature, moisture, and time range. In laboratory studies, we found that FD instrumentation error remained constant as Rs increased. In field studies from five North American ecosystems, we found that as Rs increased from winter to peak growing season, scaling error increased by about 50% of average Rs, and random error was about 40% of average Rs. Random error, which is the residual temporal variability left unexplained by soil temperature and moisture, not only scales with soil flux, but scales in a consistent way (same slope) across ecosystems. Our findings are consistent with previous findings for both soil fluxes and eddy covariance fluxes across other Northern temperate ecosystems that showed random error scales linearly with flux magnitude with a slope of ~0.2. Although the mechanistic basis for this scaling is unknown, is a suggestive of a broadly applicable rule for the scaling of flux error. Also consistent with previous studies, we found the random error of FD follows a Laplace (double-exponential) rather than a normal (Gaussian) distribution.",

            "abstract": "Mesoproterozoic mafic magmatism at the southern part of the Baltic Shield (the Lake Ladoga region) is conventionally ascribed to epicratonic rifting. The region hosts a series of mafic dykes and sills of Mesoproterozoic ages, including a ca. 1.53-1.46 Ga sheet-like gabbro-dolerite sills and the Salmi plateau-basalts from the Lake Ladoga region. Based on chiefly geochemical data, the region is conventionally interpreted as an intracratonic Ladoga rift (graben). We question the validity of this geodynamic interpretation by analyzing regional geophysical data (crustal structure, heat flow, Bouguer gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, and mantle Vs velocities). We provide a complete list of tectonic, magmatic, and geophysical characteristics typical of continental rifts in general and demonstrate that, except for magmatic and, perhaps, some gravity signature, the Lake Ladoga region lacks any other rift features. We also compare the geophysical data from the Lake Ladoga region with a similar in age Midcontinent rift (USA) and the Valday rift (NW Russia), and provide alternative explanations for the Mesoproterozoic geodynamic evolution of the southern Baltic Shield. We propose that Mesoproterozoic mafic intrusions in southern Fennoscandia may be associated with a complex deformation pattern during reconfiguration of (a part of) Nuna (Columbia) supercontinent, which led to magma intrusions as a series of mafic dykes along lithosphere weakness zones and ponding of small magma pockets within the cratonic lithosphere. Consequent magma cooling and its partial transition to eclogite facies could have led to the formation of a series of basement depressions, similar to the intracratonic basins of North America, while spatially heterogeneous thermo-chemical subsidence, with phase transitions locally speeded by the presence of (subduction-related) fluids, could have produced a series of faults bounding graben-like structures.",

            "abstract": "Gulf of Alaska sediments contain distinct, low-diversity assemblages of benthic and planktic foraminifera, whose distribution is a function of food availability, water mass properties, ice proximity, transport/deposition, predation, and taphonomic processes. Spatial and temporal changes in diversity reflect these processes and provide insight into this margin’s history. Two quantitative techniques are integrated to define and characterize benthic foraminferal biozones in Gulf of Alaska sediment core samples collected by the R/V Maurice Ewing in 2004 at shelf site EW0408-79JC (59.53° N, 141.76° W, 158 m depth), and slope site EW0408-85JC (59.56° N, 144.15° W, 682 m depth). Sediments date from the end of the most recent glaciation (diamict in 85JC) to the present (bioturbated, silty clay at both sites).\nWe apply SHE analysis, a graphical, iterative technique, based on diversity trends in a plot of ln E vs. ln N, where E is species evenness and N is cumulative number of specimens. In each step, the plot is examined for the first change in slope between successive samples, representing a change in diversity. At this point a boundary is defined, samples before the break are removed, and the analysis is repeated until all samples are analyzed. Data are further analyzed using an unmixing algorithm known as polytopic vector analyses. This technique defines a small number of orthogonal end members that explain a majority of the variance, thus reducing data complexity and aiding interpretation.\nSHE-analysis of benthic foraminiferal data defines eighteen informal abundance biozones. Polytopic vector analyses indicate that the faunal assemblages reflect mixtures of up to seven distinct biofacies: outer neritic (2), upper bathyal (2), reduced oxygen (2), and inner neritic. Rapid changes in faunal diversity correspond with increased sedimentation rates, especially during the end of the most recent glaciation (17 to 16 ka). The same relationship occurs over the last 1000 years at the shelf site. Where the cores overlap in age, many more assemblage boundaries occur in the shelf core, suggesting a comparatively dynamic environment relative to the slope. The least amount of diversity change corresponds with the laminated intervals in 85JC, coincident with high productivity and development of anoxia during regional deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "Alterations to flow regimes from regulation and climate change affect the biophysical functioning of rivers. Re-operating reservoirs to provide environmental flows - the quantity, quality, and timing of water to sustain natural river functions and species - is now widely applied in multi-objective water resources management. However, the absence of a quantitative, transferable framework for evaluating the relationships between hydrologic inputs, geomorphic functions, and ecological responses, remains a major limitation to setting environmental ﬂows standards. This research addresses this gap by developing a hydrologic classification framework for the State of California that balances operational practicality with scientific defensibility. The framework organizes river reaches into: (1) natural flow classes based on (a) a classification model that clusters hydrologic indices calculated directly from unimpaired streamflow data, and (b) a regression model using a set of climatic, landscape, and local geomorphic controls over the flow regime, and (2) functional zones constrained by temporal (seasonal) ranges and hydrologic (average flow percentile-based) thresholds (e.g. summer low flows). The framework is then used to (1) identify major climatic, landscape, and local geomorphic controls over prototypical flow regime signatures, and (2) characterize key natural functions and processes expected of reaches of each flow class and functional zone during wet, dry, and normal water year types. Organizing hydrologic data in this manner provides a means of comparison and transferability of ecologically-significant hydrologic and geomorphic information across reaches of all major flow classes seen in California, both regulated and unregulated. Through this framework, transferable relationships between hydrologic and physiographic conditions, flow alteration, and ecological metrics can be developed and tested on the basis of data obtained from a limited set of study sites.",

            "abstract": "In the past two decades there have been several advances that make the production of an atlas of submarine glacial landforms timely. First is the development of high-resolution imaging technologies; multi-beam echo-sounding or swath bathymetry that allows the detailed mapping of the sea floor at water depths of tens to thousands of metres across continental margins, and 3-D seismic methods that enable the visualisation of palaeo-continental shelves in Quaternary sediments and ancient palaeo-glacial rocks (e.g. Late Ordovician of Northern Africa). A second technological development is that of ice-breaking or ice-strengthened ships that can penetrate deep into the ice-infested waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, to deploy the multibeam systems. A third component is that of relevance – through both the recognition that the polar regions, and especially the Arctic, are particularly sensitive parts of the global environmental system and that these high-latitude margins (both modern and ancient) are likely to contain significant hydrocarbon resources. An enhanced understanding of the sediments and landforms of these fjord-shelf-slope systems is, therefore, of increasing importance to both academics and industry. We are editing an Atlas of Submarine Glacial Landforms that presents a series of individual contributions that describe, discuss and illustrate features on the high-latitude, glacier-influenced sea floor. Contributions are organised in two ways: first, by position on a continental margin – from fjords, through continental shelves to the continental slope and rise; secondly, by scale – as individual landforms and assemblages of landforms. A final section provides discussion of integrated fjord-shelf-slope systems. Over 100 contributions by scientists from many countries contain descriptions and interpretation of swath-bathymetric data from both Arctic and Antarctic margins and use 3D seismic data to investigate ancient glacial landforms. The Atlas will be published in late 2015 in the Memoir Series of the Geological Society of London.",

            "abstract": "A winter weather parameter that is underutilized in the prediction of Northeast snowfall events is critical thickness. Knowledge of atmospheric thickness values during snowfall can benefit the accuracy of winter forecasts, especially if thickness layer ranges at times without precipitation are known. This investigation aims to better understand atmospheric thickness variations in the 1000-500, 1000-700, and 1000-850 hPa layers at Albany, New York during snowfall with differing air mass conditions. Since snow can occur alongside a variety of air mass environments, distinctions in layer thickness between air mass types and critical levels will be examined. Pairing air mass information with an improved understanding of thicknesses may allow forecasters to determine normal snowfall conditions of the atmosphere and decipher when anomalous conditions are occurring alongside heavier snows. Daily geopotential height data are examined alongside Spatial Synoptic Classification weather types over the past decade. Air mass frequencies are computed and baseline thicknesses are established for non-snow days, days with snow and liquid precipitation, and days with only snowfall. Thicknesses are compared to those computed for seven air mass types and differences layers are examined for continuity. For the three air masses identified as prevalent during heavy snow, light-to-heavy and early-to-late season snowfall categories are established and thickness variations are evaluated against non-snow days for significant differences. Results indicate that the differences in layer thicknesses are comparable for all precipitation and non-snow days but around 40 geopotential meters less for pure-snow days. For air masses present during snow, layer thicknesses can vary by over 100 gpm with type. Isolating polar varieties, approximately 50 gpm thickness differences are found in pure-snow days. Comparable differences are detected between the moderate and polar types and the continuity between layers varies with type. In distinguishing by snow total, the thinnest and thickest layers vary for the Dry Polar, Moist Polar and Transitional air masses. Continuity in layer differences are also unique so that Transitional and Moist Polar exhibit comparable variations that the Dry Polar days do not display.",

            "abstract": "Most gravel-bedded rivers with perennial base flow are often armored, defined as having a bed surface grain size distribution that is coarser than the subsurface. In contrast, ephemerally flowing rivers, which are commonly flash flood-dominated, are typically unarmored. Although both types of channels have high peak discharges during floods, a key difference between these hydrological settings is in flow intermittency and how much flow occurs during moderate and low flow periods. High sediment supply and elevated shear stresses during floods have been identified as processes that may reduce or prevent armor development, but the preferential transport of smaller grain sizes during lower flows may also strongly affect armor development. We use numerical modeling to explore the relative importance of these armor-related processes. Calculations are based on a previous model called the Spawning Gravel Refresher, which includes mixed grain size sediment transport, morphodynamic feedbacks with channel slope, variable discharge hydrographs, and interactions with the subsurface grain sizes as the bed surface aggrades and erodes. Model runs are calibrated to natural rivers with varying degrees of bed surface armoring and flood hydrograph shape. These natural rivers include: i) the Nahal Yatir, an ephemerally flowing unarmored river in the Negev Desert, Israel, and ii) Trinity River, California, a larger perennially flowing, armored mountain river with annual snowmelt floods. We present a thorough exploration of model parameters, including base flow duration and magnitude, flood hydrograph shape and sand supply, combined with data from natural rivers. This produces quantitative bounds on how armor development varies in a wide range of parameter spaces unobtainable in the field alone.",

The objectives of this work are to constrain the number of advance-retreat cycles that have occurred through the Late Quaternary, examine the impact of the Bering Glacier on the continental shelf and slope, and reconstruct Bering Glacier dynamics. By tying these sequences with δ18O stratigraphy, we can test the Bering Glacier’s relation to global ice sheet evolution and better understand the degree to which the glacial advance-retreat cycles were in phase with global events.\nOur results show that: (1) Identification of erosional surfaces and glacigenic landforms that record positions of stillstand events and diagnose the style of retreat allow us to distinguish nine phases of glacial advances and subsequent retreats. (2) Mapping shows that glacier pathways and flow directions through time are influenced by the occurrence of thick grounding-zone deposits and shifting foci of erosion. (3) Continuous buildup of glacigenic sediment fills tectonically created accommodation space and allows the glacier to advance seaward for the last three advances. Discovery of systematic, prominent deposition of glacial diamict and ice-rafted debris (IRD) during phases of glacial retreat is supported by the drilling data and suggests reconsideration of IRD impact on slope sedimentation. (4) The trough mouth fan started its development during marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, progressively advancing to the position of present shelf edge during the subsequent MIS 4 and MIS 2 and is recognized by evidence of extensive deposition of glacigenic debris flows on the slope. (5) Sedimentation rates in the depocenter are exceptionally high and are estimated to be 1-2 m/k.y. through the middle Pleistocene on the shelf and 4-5 m/k.y. average through MIS 6 on the slope.",

            "abstract": "Evaluations of RCM downscaling skills in temperature extremes and understanding the extreme temperature changes are among the greatest desire because temperature extremes are expected to change in severity, frequency, and duration as a result of anthropogenic global warming. Here we develop a “borrowing strength” GEV model to evaluate the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) downscaling skill in extreme temperature. A spatial-varying long-term trend is assumed for the location parameter of the GEV model, which estimates the trend of extreme temperature. The performance of WRF in extreme maximum temperature is evaluated by comparing with a reanalysis data set from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The WRF model’s ability to retain and add value beyond the driving conditions is investigated by comparing with National Centers for Environmental Prediction-U.S. Department of Energy Reanalysis II (NCEP-R2), which provides the initial and boundary conditions to the WRF. Generally, despite of certain biases for different parameters over different parts of US, there is a good agreement in spatial pattern and magnitude of three parameters of GEV distribution between the WRF and NARR. The WRF retains some value from its driver — NCEP-R2, but more importantly, it adds small-scale features beyond NCEP-R2, which is close to the NARR and essential to reproduce the extreme events.\nOn the other hand, we will show useful approaches for identifying added value by the WRF beyond the driving data in terms of precipitation (light and heavy). The approaches include (1) spatial correlation for a range of spatial lags using total monthly precipitation and non-seasonal precipitation components; and (2) spatio-temporal correlation for a wide range of distances, directions, and time lags using daily precipitation occurrence. The WRF provides realistic details of spatial and spatio-temporal correlations at finer scales than the NCEP-R2, and interestingly, the WRF also provides more accurate correlations than the driver (NCEP-R2) at the resolution of the NCEP-R2.",

            "abstract": "In subduction zones, spatial variations in pore fluid pressure are hypothesized to control the distribution and nature of slip behavior (e.g., “normal” earthquakes, slow slip events, non-volcanic tremor, very low frequency earthquakes) on the plate boundary fault. A primary control on the pore fluid pressure distribution in subduction zones is the distribution of fluid release from hydrous minerals in the subducting sediment and rock. The distributions of these diagenetic and metamorphic fluid sources are controlled by the pressure-temperature paths that the subducting material follows. Thus, constraining subduction zone thermal structure is required to inform conceptual models of seismic behavior. Here, we present results of thermal models for the Mexico subduction zone, a system that has received recent attention due to observations of slow-slip events and non-volcanic tremor. We model temperatures in five margin-perpendicular transects from 96 ˚W to 104 ˚W. In each transect, we examine the potential thermal effects of vigorous fluid circulation in a high permeability aquifer within the basaltic basement of the oceanic crust. In the transect at 100˚W, hydrothermal circulation cools the subducting material by up to 140 ˚C, shifting peak slab dehydration landward by ~100 km relative to previous estimates from models that do not include the effects of fluid circulation. The age of the subducting plate in the trench increases from ~3 Ma at 104 ˚W to ~18 Ma at 96 ˚W; hydrothermal circulation redistributes the most heat (and cools the system the most) where the subducting plate is youngest. For systems with <20 Ma subducting lithosphere, hydrothermal circulation in oceanic crust should be considered in estimating subduction zone temperatures and fluid source distributions.",

            "abstract": "Strong motion accelerometers can record large amplitude shaking on-scale in the near-field of large earthquake ruptures; however, numerical integration of such records to determine displacement is typically unstable due to baseline changes (i.e., distortions in the zero value) that occur during strong shaking. We use datasets from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake to assess whether a relatively simple empirical correction scheme (Boore et al., 2002) can return accurate displacement waveforms useful for constraining details of the fault slip. The coseismic deformation resulting from the Tohoku earthquake was recorded by the Kiban Kyoshin network (KiK-net) of strong motion instruments as well as by a dense network of high-rate (1 Hz) GPS instruments. After baseline correcting the KiK-net records and integrating to displacement, over 85% of the KiK-net borehole instrument waveforms and over 75% of the KiK-net surface instrument waveforms match collocated 1 Hz GPS displacement time series. Most of the records that do not match the GPS-derived displacements following the baseline correction have large, systematic drifts that can be automatically identified by examining the slopes in the first 5-10 seconds of the velocity time series.\nWe apply the same scheme to strong motion records from the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake. Close correspondence in both direction and amplitude between coseismic static offsets derived from the integrated strong motion time series and those predicted from a teleseismically-derived finite fault model, as well as displacement amplitudes consistent with InSAR-derived results, suggest that the correction scheme works successfully for the Iquique event. In the absence of GPS displacements, these strong motion-derived offsets provide constraints on the overall distribution of slip on the fault. In addition, the coseismic strong motion-derived displacement time series (50-100 s long) contain a near-field record of the temporal evolution of the rupture, supplementing teleseismic data and improving resolution of the location and timing of moment in finite fault models.",

            "abstract": "Ceres likely contains considerable water, has differentiated, and formed a hydrated silicate core and water mantle. There were major dimensional, thermal and chemical changes over its history, making it more a planet than an asteroid. These factors created the present day body, which the Dawn misson will visit next March. I will summarize our current understanding of Ceres and suggest what Dawn will find. A major uncertainty is how processes, such as aqueous mineralization, impact and cratering, infall of external material, mixing, and viscous relaxation of surface features have altered the formation materials and surface, hiding Ceres’ secrets. Ceres’ bulk density of 2100 kg/m3, suggest major water content. Modeling of Ceres’ thermodynamic evolution for different times of accretion, assuming several radioactive heating scenarios, produces results ranging from a dry Vestal-like object (earlier, hotter formation) to retention and melting of the ice and differentiation of silicates from liquid water. Mixing of liquid water and silicates leads to exothermic hydration reactions, formation of a core and a liquid mantle. Large dimensional changes are associated. A crust stays frozen but founders at times due to gravitational instability, dimensional changes and impacts. The liquid mantle freezes from top, down, but a layer of salty liquid water probably exists today near the core. Hydrated silicates from the initial differentiation would likely dehydrate near the core center due to temperature and pressure. From observations, only subdued spatial albedo and color variations are observed at UV and IR wavelengths on Ceres’ surface at the scale possible from Earth (~50-100 km) and an oblate spheroid shape is found, consistent with a differentiated body. Compositional evidence includes the long known similarity of Ceres’ albedo and visual-IR reflectance spectrum to those for carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Thus, the surface is likely made of carbon-bearing, hydroxolated materials, with spectral evidence of OH and maybe H2O molecules, consistent with the results of both the evolutionary thermodynamic models and infill of carbonaceous chondrite-like materials. Two reports of OH and H2O in the exosphere, apparently originating from localized sources, suggest present day cryovolcanism.",

In the thermal infrared, we must account for the temperature, emissivity, and elevation of the surface beneath the plume, plume altitude and thickness, and local atmospheric temperature and humidity. Our knowledge of these parameters is never perfect, and interactive mapping allows us to evaluate the impact of these uncertainties on our estimates of plume composition.\nTo enable interactive mapping, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is collaborating with Spectral Sciences, Inc., (SSI) to develop the Plume Tracker toolkit. This project is funded by a NASA AIST Program Grant (AIST-11-0053) to SSI. Plume Tracker integrates (1) retrieval procedures for surface temperature and emissivity, SO2, NH3, or CH4 column abundance, and scaling factors for H2O vapor and O3 profiles, (2) a RT modeling engine based on MODTRAN, and (3) interactive visualization and analysis utilities under a single graphics user interface.\nThe principal obstacle to interactive mapping is the computational overhead of the RT modeling engine. Under AIST-11-0053 we have achieved a 300-fold increase in the performance of the retrieval procedures through the use of indexed caches of model spectra, optimization of the minimization procedures, and scaling of the effects of surface temperature and emissivity on model radiance spectra. In the final year of AIST-11-0053 we will implement parallel processing to exploit multi-core CPUs and cluster computing, and optimize the RT engine to eliminate redundant calculations when iterating over a range of gas concentrations. These enhancements will result in an additional 8 – 12X increase in performance. In addition to the improvements in performance, we have improved the accuracy of the Plume Tracker retrievals through refinements in the description of surface emissivity and use of vector projection to define the misfit between model and observed spectra.\nPortions of this research were conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

Planners seek optimal portfolios of supply and demand management schemes but also when to activate assets whilst considering many system goals and plausible futures. Incorporation of scheduling into the planning under uncertainty problem strongly increases its complexity. We investigate some approaches to scheduling with many-objective heuristic search. We apply a multi-scenario many-objective scheduling approach to the Thames River basin water supply system planning problem in the UK. Decisions include which new supply and demand schemes to implement, at what capacity and when. The impact of different system uncertainties on scheme implementation schedules are explored, i.e. how the choice of future scenarios affects the search process and its outcomes. The activation of schemes is influenced by the occurrence of extreme hydrological events in the ensemble of plausible scenarios and other factors. The approach and results are compared with a previous study where only the portfolio problem is addressed (without scheduling).",

Another class of diagenetic reactions involves the breakdown of organic matter and trace element behaviour (Froelich et al., 1979). The translation of chemical gradients into fluxes requires estimates of pore water chemistry across the sea water - sediment surface boundary. Additionally, the use of the chemistry of benthic foraminiferal calcite for seawater paleochemistry requires estimation of the chemistry of pore waters which may differ from that of bottom seawater because of diagenetic reactions.\nIn this work we have collected multi core samples from 10 core sites on cruise RRS James Cook JC089 on the southwest Iberian continental margin. Pore waters were extracted from the core surface and at 1 cm depth intervals down core (typically to ~40 cm depth) using Rhizon samplers and analysed for Alkalinity, DIC, ∂13C and Na, K, Mg, Ca, Li, Mn, Fe, Ba, B, Sr by atomic emission spectrophotometry as well as O2 penetration and pH by microelectrodes. This has allowed us to inspect chemical behavior at the bottom water - sediment interface. Some examples of results are a large gradient in ∂13C of DIC, the similarity of zero O2 penetration followed by an increase in Mn concentration and then decrease to zero, the similarity of Li to Mn and, in contrast to much DSDP/ODP work, Ca2+ and Mg2+both decrease with depth in pore waters near the sediment surface.\n",

            "abstract": "South Asia faces a remarkably complex and diverse set of hydrologic stresses, including melting glaciers, variable snowpack, intensively utilized transboundary rivers, rapid groundwater depletion due to irrigation, flood and drought hazard, and rapidly changing land use/cover and climate conditions. The management and prediction challenges posed by these conditions are compounded by the sparseness of in situ monitoring sites, particularly in headwaters regions, and a lack of open sharing of hydrometeorological data across national boundaries. As a result, uncertainties in availability in a situation of rising demands are leading to increasing competing and exploitive use of a limited resource, being experienced at various scales. An open water information system for decision support is an absolute necessity. In order to provide an open and spatially complete water information system for decision support across the region, we are implementing a customized Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) designed to provide best-available estimates of hydrologic states and fluxes across South Asia, both retrospectively and in near-real time. The LDAS merges advanced land surface models with satellite-derived and in situ observations. In the case of South Asia, multiple satellite-derived hydrological fields are relevant to complete water balance analysis, including precipitation from multiple sources (e.g., TRMM, CHIRPS, GPM), water storage anomalies from GRACE, thermal infrared evapotranspiration estimates, and snowpack characteristics from visible and microwave sensors. Each of these observation types can either be ingested to South Asia LDAS or used as an independent observation for comparison. Here we present the first results of this South Asian Land Data Assimilation System, with a focus on complete water balance analysis for selected river basins in South Asia.",

            "abstract": "Human land use will increasingly contribute to habitat losses and water shortages in California, given future population projections and associated demand for agricultural land. Understanding how land-use change may impact future water use and where existing protected areas may be threatened by land-use conversion will be important if effective, sustainable management approaches are to be implemented. We used a state-and-transition simulation modeling (STSM) framework to simulate spatially-explicit (1 km2) historical (1992-2010) and future (2011-2060) land-use change for 52 California counties within the Mediterranean California ecoregion. Historical land use change estimates were derived from the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) dataset and attributed with county-level agricultural water-use data from the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). Six future alternative land-use scenarios were developed and modeled using the historical land-use change estimates and land-use projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 scenarios. Resulting spatial land-use scenario outputs were combined based on scenario agreement and a land conversion threat index developed to evaluate vulnerability of existing protected areas. Modeled scenario output of county-level agricultural water use data were also summarized, enabling examination of alternative water use futures. We present results of two separate applications of STSM of land-use change, demonstrating the utility of STSM in analyzing land-use related impacts on water resources as well as potential threats to existing protected land. Exploring a range of alternative, yet plausible, land-use change impacts will help to better inform resource management and mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Modeling of multivariate time-series produced by complex systems requires efficient tools for compact data representation. In this report we consider this problem, relating to empirical modeling of climate, which implies an analysis of spatial-distributed time-series. The main goal is to establish the number of principal modes which have key contribution to data and actually governs the observed variability. Currently, the number of widely used methods based on PCA and factor analysis exists, which yield different data decompositions taking into consideration spatial/spatio-temporal correlations in observed dynamics: spatial empirical orthogonal functions, M-SSA, varimax rotation, empirical orthogonal teleconnections, and so on. However, the question about possibility of improving the decomposition by taking into account nonlinear couplings between variables often remains untouched.\nIn the report the method for construction of principal dynamic modes on the basis of low-dimensional nonlinear parametric representation of observed multivariate time-series is suggested. It is aimed to extracting the set of latent modes that both explains an essential part of variability, and obeys the simplest evolution law. Thus, this approach can be used for optimal reconstruction of the phase space for empirical prognostic modeling of observed dynamics. Criterion of evidence of the nonlinearity, which allows estimating optimal parameters of data representation (including the number of parameters in mode definition and the number of principal modes) is proposed.\nThe effectiveness of suggested method is firstly demonstrated on toy model example: two-dimensional strongly nonlinear problem of unknown dynamic mode retrieval from noisy data is considered. Next, the evidence of nonlinear couplings in SST space-distributed data covering the Globe is investigated by the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that the obtained principal modes capture more part of SST variability than principal components (PCs) constructed by EOF or spatio-temporal EOF expansions. In particular, the first nonlinear mode almost completely describes ENSO phenomenon by capturing three ENSO-related PCs obtained from EOF decomposition. The application of the approach to data-driven forecasting of ENSO dynamics is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetotail dynamics, we investigate the onset of reconnection in realistic tail configurations. Reconnection onset is preceded by a driven phase, during which magnetic flux is added to the tail at the high-latitude boundaries, followed by a relaxation phase, during which the configuration continues to respond to the driving. We found a clear distinction between stable and unstable cases, dependent on deformation amplitude and ion/electron mass ratio. The threshold appears consistent with electron tearing. The evolution prior to onset as well as the evolution of stable cases, are largely independent of the mass ratio, governed by integral entropy conservation as imposed in MHD. This suggests that ballooning instability in the tail should not be expected prior to the onset of tearing and reconnection. The onset time and other onset properties depend on the mass ratio, consistent with expectations for electron tearing. At onset, we found electron anisotropies Tperp/Tparallel = 1.1-1.3, raising growth rates and wave numbers. Our simulations have provided a quantitative onset criterion that is easily evaluated in MHD simulations, provided the spatial resolution is sufficient.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of biogenic carbon fluxes from agricultural lands is needed to generate globally consistent bottom-up estimates for carbon monitoring and model input. We quantify agricultural carbon fluxes associated with annual (starting in 1961) crop net primary productivity (NPP), harvested biomass, and human and livestock consumption and emissions, with estimates of uncertainty, by applying region- and species-specific carbon parameters to annual crop, livestock, food and trade inventory data, and generate downscaled, gridded (0.05 degree resolution) representations of these fluxes.\nIn 2011, global crop NPP was 5.25 ± 0.46 Pg carbon (excluding root exudates), of which 2.05 ± 0.051 Pg carbon was harvested as primary crops; an additional 0.54 Pg of crop residue carbon was collected for livestock fodder. In 2011, total livestock feed intake was 2.42 ± 0.21 Pg carbon, of which 2.31 ± 0.21 Pg carbon was emitted as carbon dioxide and 0.072 ± 0.005 Pg carbon was emitted as methane. We estimate that livestock grazed 1.18 Pg carbon from non-crop lands in 2011, representing 48.5 % of global total feed intake. In 2009, the latest available data year, we estimate global human food intake (excluding seafood and orchard fruits and nuts) at 0.52 ± 0.03 Pg carbon, with an additional 0.24 ± 0.01 Pg carbon of food supply chain losses. Trends in production and consumption of agricultural carbon between 1961 and recent years, such as increasing dominance of oilcrops and decreasing percent contribution of pasturage to total livestock feed intake, are discussed, and accounting of all agricultural carbon was done for the years 2005 and 2009. Gridded at 0.05 degree resolution, these quantities represent local uptake and release of agricultural biogenic carbon (e.g. biomass production and removal, residue and manure inputs to soils) and may be used with other gridded data to help estimate current and future changes in soil organic carbon.",

In this proof-of-concept research experiment, we acquired 2D P- and SH- wave data over active water pipes and a backfilled ditch buried at the similar depths with no distinguishing surface expression. The first pipe with 0.6m diameter is located at 1.0m depth, the second pipe with 0.75m diameter is located at similar depth and the ditch is located at approximately 2.0m depth. P-and SH- data were acquired along a common profile with vertical and horizontal component geophones respectively using explosive point sources. Initial results from the P-wave FWI shows velocity updates with similar polarity at the pipe and backfilled locations. The S-wave full waveform inversion on the other hand shows velocity updates of reciprocal polarity at both locations. Results clearly show the utility of complementing routinely generated P-wave models with SH-wave acquisition.",

This scale of stratigraphic heterogeneity is not represented in even relatively sophisticated static models. A 3D numerical study is conducted to investigate the controls, process and pattern for the fine deposits (mud deposits) over the point bars. The study covers the effect of river cross section, river planform shape, suspended load grain size, and the seasonal variation in river flow discharge. The distribution of the fine-grained deposits is found to be controlled by flow divergence. The river cross section is a major control on the presence of flow divergence as it controls the velocity patterns in the cross section and this acts as the major control in the sediment partitioning. Bend geometry also has a first order effect on the length scale of the divergence. Seasonal variation in river flow affects the deposition amount over the point bars. Higher flow discharge results in thicker deposits over point bars. Also, increasing the size of the suspended load grain size results in thicker deposits on the upstream part of the point bars.",

            "abstract": "Introductory courses in environmental science are challenging to teach effectively because instructors need to balance the breadth of content coverage with the depth needed to solve complex, interdisciplinary environmental problems. For three years, the Council on Science and Technology at Princeton University has been collaborating with faculty to enhance the introductory environmental science course as part of the Science and Engineering Education Initiative, which aims to ensure that all students, regardless of discipline, graduate with an appreciation for and literacy in science and engineering. Our primary aim in the course is to foster improved environmental citizenship by helping students develop a mechanistic understanding of our individual, societal, and global role as agents of environmental change; an ability to predict or forecast the potential impact that decisions may have on the future structure and function of Earth systems; and a sense of responsibility that leads to informed action and decision-making related to environmental issues. Toward those ends, we have 1) reframed the course curriculum to focus on the central theme of “planetary boundaries” (Rockstrom et al., 2009), including their scientific evidence and policy implications, 2) developed hands-on laboratory exercises that give students authentic research experiences, and 3) modified the assessment to ensure that the students have consistent and clear indications of their mastery of the material. Student feedback through course surveys has been positive, although challenges remain, including coordination across a large teaching staff (two lead instructors for lecture and three TAs for discussion sections, plus a lead lab instructor and one lab TA), optimizing learning activities across the course structure (lecture, precept, and an optional lab), and engaging students that have diverse academic interests.",

            "abstract": "Observations from the North and South American Cordillera show that mean and maximum elevations decrease with increasing latitude. The trend in elevation follows the latitudinal dependence of snowline altitudes. This correlation between elevation and snowline altitude has been the impetus behind the glacial ‘buzzsaw’ hypothesis, which states that glaciers limit the elevation of mountain peaks. Underlying this hypothesis is an assumption that elevations prior to glaciation were either uniform, randomly distributed, or followed a pattern that is no longer present. However, there may be other factors that are responsible for these patterns, such as latitudinal trends in precipitation. Here, we address this assumption and the necessity of glacial erosion in explaining the latitudinal trend in elevation. We use the CHILD landscape evolution model parameterized by modern precipitation data along a latitudinal gradient in the Andes to predict the topography in the absence of glaciation. Using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis precipitation data from 1981-2010, we derive storm duration, intensity, and frequency statistics for a series of locations along the Andean orogen. For each location, we run a model using a sequence of storms generated from these statistics. Erodibility and rock-uplift are held constant between the different locations and the models are run until topographic steady-state is achieved. We also present runs exploring the role of a threshold for bedrock detachment in the modeled results. For each run, we track the maximum and mean elevation as well as the time to steady-state. Preliminary results for all cases show that fluvial processes alone are sufficient to account for the latitudinal dependence of topography. For example, landscapes produced with precipitation statistics similar to the dry central Andes are more than an order of magnitude higher than landscapes from the southern, wetter, part of the orogen. Future analysis will use precipitation data from Pliocene climate models as well as link CHILD with a spatially-distributed hydrology model (TopoFlow). Although preliminary, our results potentially challenge the glacial ‘buzzsaw’ hypothesis and present fluvial erosion as a capable mechanism of generating latitudinal trends in topography.",

            "abstract": "We present a spatially and temporally explicit analysis of burned area and fire carbon emissions in Alaska using a time series with ~500 m spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution between 2001 and 2012. Daily burned area was mapped using perimeter data from the Alaskan Large Fire Database, and imagery from MODIS. 33 % of the area within perimeters was mapped as unburned by differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) screening. We built a non-linear multiplicative model to predict carbon consumption as a response of different environmental variables based on relationships with field data. The environmental variables included in the model were elevation, time of burning, tree cover and dNBR. The interaction between elevation and time of burning was crucial in modelling belowground consumption. Higher consumption estimates occurred later in the season and at intermediate elevations. Additional explanatory power and better representation of the spatial heterogeneity was achieved by including tree cover and dNBR. We found a clear relationship between dNBR and depth of burn from field measurements. The relationships between belowground consumption, and dNBR and tree cover, suggest a direct relationship between the amount of consumption of below- and aboveground biomass, with the highest consumption occurring at plots with dense black spruce cover. In our spatio-temporal domain, we found an overall median consumption of 2.26 kg C m-2, which included significant amounts of burning in cover types other than black spruce, and 2.71 kg C m-2 when only pure black spruce pixels were considered. These values were lower than the median value observed in the field data and suggest that available field data is biased toward high consumption. Our analysis stresses the importance of accounting for the spatial heterogeneity within fuels and consumption when extrapolating emissions in space and time. Data on daily burned area and emissions could be of further use for assessing fire impacts on atmospheric trace gas composition and in characterizing environmental controls on fire growth. Emission estimates of the 2013 fire season were input into an aerosol transport model and modeled CO2 concentrations were compared with measurements from NASA’s CARVE mission during fire-affected days.",

            "abstract": "Splitting of shear waves is commonly used to infer anisotropy of the Earth’s interior. However, most data, such as SKS splitting, provide depth-integrated measure of anisotropy along the ray path, and it is difficult to separate contributions from different layers within the Earth. There have been efforts to focus on specific depth range by analyzing differences in splitting between two ray paths, but these studies only report observed differences or rely upon forward modeling with limited parameter-space search. We have developed a new approach to examine the P-to-S converted phases that allows one to construct depth-dependent multi-layer anisotropy models through combination of inversion and grid search.\nIn addition to the conventional fast splitting direction and delay time, the technique allows one to investigate the tilt of the symmetry axis and dip of the discontinuity associated with the P-to-S conversion. Furthermore, the formulation is such that it naturally extends to include and examine multiple layers with different anisotropic properties. With these flexibilities, we can address anisotropic contributions from different layers in two separate procedures. The first scheme takes advantage of data with similar ray paths (e.g., SKS and SKKS waves recorded at the same station). The rays sample different structure when their ray paths differ (e.g., near the core-mantle boundary), but they sample the same structure when the paths are similar (e.g., in the upper part of the mantle and crust). Using our new approach, we can set up the problem as a two-layer anisotropy model where the layer with ray paths sampling different regions (e.g., lowermost mantle) is allowed to vary laterally. The second type of problem that can be addressed by the new approach is layer-by-layer investigation of anisotropy from top to bottom. This procedure combines the new method with receiver function analysis to obtain anisotropic properties of each layer using P-to-S converted waves from different discontinuities such as the Moho, 410-km and 660-km discontinuities. The application of the methods to real data shows significant lateral variations in anisotropy, both in deep Earth and near the surface.",

            "abstract": "As an emerging industry, Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) is expected to play a major contributory role if the UK is to successfully reach its desired target of renewable energy production by 2020. However, due to the competing objectives and priorities of MRE and other industries, for example fisheries, and in the delivering of conservation measures, the demand for space within our marine landscape is increasing, and interactions are inevitable.\nIn order to promote better understanding of the challenges in resolving interactions between these industries, a Fisheries and Marine Renewable Energy Working Group was set up under the Natural Environment Research Council Marine Renewable Energy Knowledge Exchange Programme (NERC MREKEP). The Working Group carried out an initial scoping survey in order to summarise recent and current research activities and identify key issues and topics in the fields of fisheries and MRE interactions. Mixed stakeholder groups discussed four primary topics: priority issues; barriers to progress; problem mitigation; and thoughts on the consultation process. Points of discussion were categorized into themes to aid analysis and protocol development. These themes were: culture, community and economy; legislation and rights; data and information; and collaboration and communication.\nSubsequent invited stakeholder and expert panel workshops were held to facilitate knowledge exchange between fisheries and development of MRE in order to identify priority research issues, knowledge gaps and collaboration needs. Four group sessions identified: practical steps to aid interaction between industries; barriers, opportunities and solutions; an agenda for action, timescales and partners; and action points carried forward by each stakeholder group.\nThis Working Group, guided under the MREKEP banner, is the first of its kind in the UK, bringing together individuals from a nationally diverse group of academics, regulators, policy makers and representatives from fisheries, MRE sectors and conservation bodies. Therefore, it has the potential, for the first time, to develop effective guidelines and protocols for both mitigation and assessment of displacement of fishing effort, for the entire life cycle of MRE projects.",

            "abstract": "Field work carried out on the Piton des Neiges volcano (Réunion Island) suggests that the injection of magma along detachments could trigger flank failure by conjugate opening and shear displacement [Famin and Michon, 2010]. We use 3D numerical models to compare the ability of purely opened sheet intrusions, sheared sheet intrusions, and normal faults to induce flank displacement on basaltic volcanoes (Figure). We assume that shear stress change on fractures which are not normal to a principal stress results from stress anisotropy of the host rock under gravity. Exploring a large range of stress anisotropies, fracture dips, and fracture depth over length ratios, we determine that the amount of shear displacement is independent of the proximity to the ground surface. Sheared sheet intrusions are the most efficient slip medium on volcanoes. Using our model in a forward way, we provide shear and normal displacements for buried fractures. Applying the model to a pile of sills at the Piton des Neiges volcano, we determine that the mean shear displacement caused by each intrusion was 3.7 m, leading to a total of a 180-260 m of lateral displacement for the 50 m high pile of sills. Using our model in an inverse way, we formulate a decision tree to determine some fracture characteristics and the host rock stress anisotropy from ratios of maximum surface displacements. This procedure provides a priori models, thus limits to the parameter space which can be further explored through a formal inversion. Applying this procedure to the 1.4 m co-eruptive flank displacement recorded at Piton de la Fournaise in 2007, we find that it probably originated from a shallow eastward-dipping sub-horizontal normal fault.",

            "abstract": "Positioned between the Sierra Nevada microplate and Basin and Range in western North America, the Walker Lane (WL) accommodates ~20% of the dextral motion between the North American and Pacific plates on predominately NW-striking\ndextral and ENE to E-W-striking sinistral fault systems. The Terrill Mountains (TM) lie at the northern terminus of a domain of dextral faults accommodating translation of crustal-blocks in the central WL and at the southeast edge of sinistral faults accommodating oroclinal flexure and CW rotation of blocks in the northern WL. As the mechanisms of strain transfer between these disparate fault systems are poorly understood, the thick Oligocene to Pliocene volcanic strata of the TM area make it an ideal site for studying the transfer of strain between regions undergoing differing styles of deformation and yet both accommodating dextral shear. Detailed geologic mapping and paleomagnetic study of ash-flow tuffs in the TM region has been conducted to elucidate Neogene strain accommodation for this transitional region of the WL. Strain at the northernmost TM appears to be transferred from a system of NW-striking dextral faults to a system of ~E-W striking sinistral faults with associated CW flexure. A distinct ~23 Ma paleosol is locally preserved below the tuff of Toiyabe and provides an important marker bed. This paleosol is offset with ~6 km of dextral separation across the fault bounding the NE flank of the TM. This fault is inferred as the northernmost strand of the NW-striking, dextral Benton Spring fault system, with offset consistent with minimums constrained to the south (6.4-9.6 km, Gabbs Valley Range). Paleomagnetic results suggest counter-intuitive CCW vertical-axis rotation of crustal blocks south of the domain boundary in the system of NW-striking dextral faults, similar to some other domains of NW-striking dextral faults in the northern WL. This may result from coeval dextral shear and WNW-directed extension within the left-stepping system of dextral fault. The left steps are analogous to Riedel shears developing above a more through-going shear zone at depth. However, a site directly adjacent to the Benton Springs fault is rotated ~30° CW, likely due to fault drag. These results show the complex and important contribution of vertical-axis rotations in accommodation of dextral shear.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition can potentially alter soil biogeochemistry in alpine tundra ecosystems by soil acidification, resulting in accelerated nutrient leaching as well as reduced microbial and plant diversity. Several field studies have simulated various atmospheric nitrogen loading rates and observed changes in above ground biomass, species diversity, and soil buffering capacity. Few studies to date have examined the biogeochemical behavior and transport of nitrogen in alpine tundra soil. The objective of this study is to evaluate nitrate transport in soil and the chemical behavior of associated leached ionic species. To accomplish this, a soil leaching study was conducted using both composite soil columns and intact soil cores collected in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA (3,658 m). Soil columns were leached in a temperature controlled environmental chamber with DI water adjusted for pH and ionic strength. Leachates were collected using a fraction collector and analyzed using IC and ICP-MS. Analysis of collected leachates for intact soil cores indicated a complex mixture of inorganic and organic anions moving in the soil wetting front, with elevated NO3- concentration > 15 mg/L. Nitrate concentration decreased rapidly after initial column breakthrough. Leaching of individual soil horizons indicated high NO3- concentrations > 15 mg/L in collected pore volumes for both the organic and subsurface horizons. Elevated concentrations of both inorganic (SO42-, F-) and organic anions (acetate, oxalate) were found in these horizons. Fluctuation of approximately 1-1.5 pH units for the intact soil column leachates and the anion elution order suggests possible complex anion exchange processes in the soil wetting front between various soil solid phases.",

The Great Lakes region falls between areas that are typically defined as the Midwest and Northeast in the United States and also includes portions of Ontario in Canada. This unique and complex region holds approximately 21% of global surface fresh water and is home to 23 million people on the United States side of the basin alone. GLISA functions as a bridge between climate science researchers and boundary organizations in the Great Lakes region, with the goals of contributing to the long-term sustainability of the region in face of a changing climate and to facilitate smart decision-making backed by sound scientific knowledge. Faculty and staff associated with GLISA implement physical and social science practices in daily operations, which includes but is not limited to: activating the boundary chain model to facilitate the transfer of knowledge through the community, integrating local and historical climate data into decision-making processes, addressing uncertainty and the downscaling of climate information, and implementing network analyses to find key access points to information networks across the Great Lakes region. GLISA also provides funding for projects related to climate and climate change adaptation in the Great Lakes region, as well as expertise to partner organizations through collaborations. Information from boundary organizations, stakeholders, and collaborators also flows back to GLISA to aid in the determination of the physical and social science needs of the region. Recent findings point to GLISA playing a crucial role in the scaling information across scales of government and ensuring that federal agencies and local stakeholders are able to learn from one another and share experiences and knowledge to continue building climate ready sectors and communities across the Great Lakes region.",

            "abstract": "Ion heating is a process that may allow low energy ions within the Martian ionosphere to be accelerated and escape. Ion heating can be especially efficient if the ions stay in the heating region for long time durations. With this in mind, the magnetic crustal field regions on Mars are particularly interesting. We focus on ions present within these regions, where changes in magnetic field strength and direction can heat these ions. Since crustal magnetic fields can maintain a trapped particle population it is unclear how efficiently plasma can be built up that can later escape to space. We investigate here two drivers: rotation of the planet and the solar wind pressure. As crustal fields rotate from the wake of the planet to the sub solar point and back, they experience compression and expansion over time scales of ~24 hours. The solar wind pressure on the other hand can cause variations over much shorter time scales (minutes).\nThe effect of these two drivers using a particle tracing simulation that solves the Lorentz force is presented. O+ ions are seeded within the simulation box. The magnetic environment is a linear sum of a dipole field and a solar wind magnetic field. The dipole field represents the magnetic crustal field and the dipole strength is chosen to be consistent with MGS magnetometer observations of Martian crustal field regions. By increasing the solar wind strength the magnetic dipole is compressed. Decreasing solar wind strength allows the dipole to expand. Small magnitude, short time scale variations can be imposed over the top of this larger variation to represent short time scale solar wind variations. Since the purpose of this analysis is to understand the changes of the ion distribution inside the crustal field, simplistic assumptions of the field outside the crustal field can be made.\nInitial results are presented, with the focus on two main questions: (a) can low energy ions be heated and escape the closed dipole field lines as a result of varying magnetic fields; (b) is the compression and relaxation of the crustal field due to rotation important for the oxygen escape rates when compared to the particle evolution due to high frequency changes in magnetic field and the lifetimes of these ions.",

            "abstract": "Island Lake, situated within the Precambrian rocks of the Beartooth Mountains that run along the border of Wyoming and Montana, is a glacial lake located at the tree line with an elevation of 3048 m, a maximum water depth of 33 m, a catchment area of 11.7 km2, and a lake area of 0.61 km2. Like many alpine lakes, Island Lake is highly transparent with a deep chlorophyll maximum. Alpine settings may be more susceptible to small perturbations in climate and thus good sensors for investigating climate change. It is hypothesized that this low-nutrient alpine lake has shifted from a nitrogen-limiting system to one that is limited by phosphorus (P) availability. In summer 2013, a 1.54-m sediment core was collected for diatom and geochemical analyses, including P and metals. Detailed P geochemistry can be used to elucidate landscape evolution and P burial fluxes can provide insight into biogeochemical cycling over time. Changes in landscape due to fire, zonal shifts in vegetation, and shifts in climatological factors such as precipitation can impact the bioavailability of P entering the lake as well as burial fluxes. The sediment record will clarify the role of P in lake biogeochemical cycling at Island Lake through the Holocene. Planktonic diatom abundances have been used to reconstruct a history of Holocene lake stratification, and ongoing detailed P geochemistry using a sequential extraction technique (SEDEX) will be used to identify the role of P fluxes on productivity within the lake. SEDEX can differentiate between P associated with oxides/oxyhydroxides, mineral fractions, and organic matter, and the relative changes in these fractions provide insight into landscape dynamics. Coupled with diatom proxies, P geochemistry can also provide a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling within the lake. This multiproxy approach should provide insight into the responses within the catchment to environmental changes over the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "During austral winter, and away from orographic maxima or “hot spots,” stratospheric gravity waves in both satellite observations and Interim European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data reveal enhanced amplitudes in a broad midlatitude belt extending across the Southern Ocean from east of the Andes to south of New Zealand. The peak latitude of this feature slowly migrates poleward from 50° to 60°S. Wave amplitudes are much weaker across the midlatitude Pacific Ocean. These features of the wave field are in striking agreement with diagnostics of baroclinic growth rates in the troposphere associated with midlatitude winter storm tracks and the climatology of the midlatitude jet. This correlation suggests that these features of the stratospheric gravity wave field are controlled by geographical variations of tropospheric nonorographic gravity wave sources in winter storm tracks: spontaneous adjustment emission from the midlatitude winter jet, frontogenesis, and convection.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic of plate tectonics is the contrast between strong plate interiors and weak plate boundaries. The weakness has both a structural aspect, as deformation zones can be reactivated during different tectonic episodes, and a dynamic aspect, as there is no major compositional difference between the lithosphere at active and inactive regions. These characteristics point to a structural origin of the weakness of plate boundaries, as deformation affect structures but structures do not heal rapidly.\nThis presentation summarizes recent advances made in estimating the rheology of polymineralic aggregates under conditions appropriate for various levels of the lithosphere. We construct a new generation of strength profiles that take into consideration the differences in microstructure that are observed in continental shear zones: reduced grain size, metamorphism, and weak phase interconnection/layering. For each lithosphere stratigraphy, two strength profiles can be constructed, one for the undeformed material, the other for a high-strain material.\nThe low-strain profile assumes a reference strain rate, constant with depth, an untextured mixture of plagioclase and biotite in the upper and middle crust (biotite being unstable in the lower crust, and an olivine-pyroxene untextured mixture in the mantle. As deformation proceeds, the fabric evolves until the phases become interconnected, and olivine grain size is reduced in the upper mantle.\nA high-strain strength profile can be derived for constant strain rate for reference. However, strain rate is likely higher in the high-strain state, but the degree of this enhancement is poorly constrained. We can follow two hypotheses. In the first, stress at each depth is the same as in the initial state. The strength profile is unmodified, but we can solve at each depth for a new strain rate. Alternatively, we can impose that the stress integrated over a lithospheric column is the same and solve for a depth-independent strain rate after the structural changes are in place. In both approaches, the enhancement of strain rate corresponds to a measure of localization achieved by the structural change.",

Important sub-regional variations in the data are subsumed in the aggregate, potentially leading to an improper handling of water resources. A combination of stream discharge characteristics and remotely sensed data can provide information that is responsive at local scales, such as watershed vulnerability to anomalous moisture conditions. We conducted an exploratory analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (500 m2 resolution, 16 day) obtained from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and USGS stream discharge (Q) records from over 100 unregulated streams in Tennessee for the years 2001-2012. The data sets were compiled to evaluate the vegetation response during a historical drought (Aug/Sept of 2007) within different streamflow recession index (SRI) regions. SRI can be applied as a metric for watershed storage and the ability of underlying aquifers to sustain streamflow through prolonged dry periods. The time series were filtered to remove seasonal trends, and bimonthly anomalies were calculated. Each of the three NDVI and Q time series (raw, filtered, and anomaly) were analyzed using cross-correlation analysis, cross-wavelet, and wavelet coherence analyses. Four SRI regions with similar land cover were chosen to spatially analyze NDVI anomalies during drought. The results from the cross-correlation analysis reveal strong biannual and annual correlations between raw NDVI and raw discharge values. Correlations between NDVI anomalies and discharge anomalies peak at lag periods of 1 to 1.5 months with NDVI leading. The wavelet coherence analysis suggests that drought dampens the monthly signal correlation between the raw values, and potentially removes a strong 2 year correlation between the anomalies. The spatial analysis shows regions with a higher SRI value tend to have higher NDVI values throughout a drought.",

            "abstract": "During Late Oligocene-Early Miocene different domains formed in the region between Iberia and Africa in the westernmost Mediterranean, including thinned continental crust and Flysch Trough turbiditic deposits. At this time, the Ronda peridotite likely constituted the subcontinental lithospheric mantle of the Alboran domain, which was undergoing strong thinning and melting coevally with Early Miocene extension in the overlying Alpujárride-Maláguide stacked crust.\nIntrusive Cr- rich pyroxenites in the Ronda massif record the geochemical processes occurring in the subcontinental mantle of the Alboran domain during the Late Oligocene. Recent isotopic studies of these pyroxenites indicate that their mantle source was contaminated by a subduction component released by detrital crustal sediments. This data is consistent with a subduction setting for the late evolution of the Alboran lithospheric mantle. Further structural studies of the Ronda peridotites have led to Hidas et al. 2013 to propose a geodynamic model where folding and shearing of an attenuated mantle lithosphere occurred by backarc basin inversion followed by failed subduction initiation that ended into the intracrustal emplacement of peridotite into the Alboran wedge in the earliest Miocene. This hypothesis implies that the crustal component recorded in late, Cr-rich websterite dykes, might come from underthrusted crustal rocks from the Flysch and/or Alpujárrides units that might have been involved in the earliest stages of this subduction stage.\nTo investigate the origin of this crustal component, we have carried out a detailed Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic study of a variety of Betic-Rif cordillera crustal rocks that might have been potentially subducted beneath the Alborán domain before the emplacement of Ronda peridotites. Crustal rocks from the Jubrique Unit overlying the Ronda peridotite are the only crustal samples that may account for the isotopic characteristics of the crustal contaminant added to the mantle source of late Cr-pyroxenites. These data strongly support Alboran geodynamic models that envisage slab roll-back as the tectonic mechanism responsable for Miocene lithospheric thinning, and provides a scenario where back-arc inversion leading to self-subduction of crustal units at the front of the Alboran wedge.

Developing techniques to extract more information, such as flow depth, from paleotsunami deposits will improve understanding of the tsunami history in vulnerable areas and provide data for tsunami hazard assessment and planning. The analysis of deposits from recent tsunamis enables the comparison between deposit characteristics and event processes because data on the source and hydrodynamics of the tsunami can be collected.\nWe compile and analyze data on tsunami hydrodynamics, deposits, and depositional environments collected in field studies over the last 16 years from 50 study sites from 7 tsunami events, including Papua New Guinea 1998, Peru 2001, Indian Ocean 2004, Sumatra 2005, Samoa 2009, Chile 2010, and Japan 2011. This approach allows comparisons of tsunami deposit characteristics across events and depositional environments. We find a moderate positive correlation between the mean grain size of a deposit and the flow depth of the tsunami, likely because more coarse material is transported by faster tsunami flows that are typical of greater flow depths. We also find that the local deposit thickness is not primarily controlled by flow depth and is strongly influenced by the contributions of bedload, variations in sediment supply, and local topography. We find that deposits often thicken when local topographic slope decreases and vice versa.\nFurther study will investigate if the thicknesses of individual suspension graded layers within deposits are controlled by tsunami flow depth. By ignoring the portions of the deposit formed by bedload transport or spatial flow deceleration, the parts of the deposit formed from sediment falling out of suspension during the temporal flow deceleration of each tsunami wave may be identified. Focusing on individual layers of tsunami deposits, hypothetically formed by a single process and wave, may reveal relationships between deposit characteristics and hydrodynamic conditions that are not apparent when analyzing deposits as a whole. Refining the understanding of depositional processes occurring in modern tsunami events provides a foundation for developing techniques to reconstruct flow conditions from paleotsunami deposits.",

An idealized Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) framework is used to study the sensitivity of the barrier layer influence on the transition of post MJO dry phase to the pre-MJO moist phase. We will discuss results from the idealized coupled simulations that are initialized either with or without the barrier layer. The sensitivity of the atmospheric boundary moisture recovery due to the presence of barrier layer as well as the sensitivity to the convective initiation will be presented. ",

            "abstract": "The evolution of lithosphere necking is a fundamental parameter controlling the structural architecture and thermal state of rifted margins. Despite a large number of analogue and numerical modelling studies on lithosphere extension are available in the literature, a quantitative experimental description of lithosphere necking evolution is still lacking. Extensional strain rate and thermal layering of the lithosphere exert a fundamental control on necking shape and evolution. We focused our experimental work on the former parameter and simulated the progression of lithosphere thinning and necking during asymmetric orthogonal rifting at different plate divergence rates. Our models involve a 4-layer mechanical continental lithosphere, which rests on a glucose syrup asthenosphere. Both the topography and the base of the lithosphere were monitored by time-lapse laser scanning. This technical approach allowed us to quantify the evolution in space and time of the thinning factors for the crust, mantle, and lithosphere as a whole. Laser-scanning monitoring provided also a detailed picture of the evolving neck shape, which shows a strong dependency on the strain-rate. At low strain-rates, necking is “boxed” with steep flanks and a flat-lying roof, and few deep basins develop at surface. At high strain-rates, more distributed thinning occurs and isolates portions of less deformed mantle. More distributed deformation affects the model topography. Despite large differences in shape, the aspect ratio (amplitude/wavelength) of the cross-sectional neck shapes converges towards very similar values at the end of the experiments.\nThe significant differences and evolutionary pathways produced by the plate divergence rate on the lithosphere necking profile, suggest that this parameter exert a fundamental control on localization vs. distribution of deformation in the crust as in the whole mechanical lithosphere. Furthermore, it can exert a fundamental control on the time and space distribution of heat flow during rifting. Following up on this we can speculate on the location and timing of synrift magmatism, which is expected to be preferentially produced on one shoulder for slow plate divergence rates, and more widely distributed and delayed at fast divergence rates.",

            "abstract": "Where will the food for the 9 billion people we expect on Earth by 2050 come from? The answer to this question depends on where the water and the energy for agriculture will come from. This assumes of course, that our primary food source will continue to be based on production on land, and that irrigation and the use of fertilizers to improve production are needed to address climate shocks and deteriorating soil health. Given this, establishing an economically, environmentally and physically feasible pathway to achieve water, energy and food security in the face of a changing climate is crucial to planetary well-being. A central hypothesis of the proposed paper is that innovation towards agricultural sustainability in countries such as India and China, that have large populations relative to their water, energy and arable land endowment, and yet have opportunity for improvement in productivity metrics such as crop yield per unit water or energy use, can show us the way to achieve global water-food-energy sustainability. These countries experience a monsoonal climate, which has a high frequency of climate extremes (more floods and droughts, and a short rainy season) relative to the developed countries in temperate climates. Global climate change projections indicate that the frequency and severity of extremes may pose a challenge in the future. Thus, strategies that are resilient to such extremes in monsoonal climates may be of global value in a warmer, more variable world. Much of the future population growth is expected to occur in Africa, S. America and S. Asia. Targeting these regions for higher productivity and resilience is consequently important from a national security perspective as well. Through this paper, we propose to (a) layout in detail, the challenges faced by the water, energy and food sectors in emerging countries, with specific focus on India and China and (b) provide the scientific background for an integrated systems analytic approach to formulate solutions at varying scales that can be employed globally. Such coordinated analyses is important for an examination of the future water sustainability in the face of changing climate, agricultural trends, environmental impacts and new energy choices.",

            "abstract": "Defining zones of high and low hydraulic conductivity within aquifers is vital to hydrogeologic research and groundwater management. Carbonate aquifers are particularly difficult to characterize due to dissolution and dolomitization. We investigated a new imaging technique for aquifer characterization that uses cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise to determine seismic velocity structure. Differences in densities between confining units and high permeability flow zones can produce distinct seismic velocities in the correlated signals. We deployed an array of 9 short period geophones from 11/2013 to 3/2014 in Indian Lake State Forest, Florida, to determine if the high frequency diffusive seismic wavefield can be used for imaging hydrostratigraphy. Here, a thin surficial layer of siliciclastic deposits overlie a ~ 0.6 km sequence of Cenozoic limestone and dolomite units that comprise the Floridan Aquifer System (FAS). A low permeability dolomite unit vertically divides the FAS throughout most of Florida. Deep boreholes surrounding the site constrain hydrostratigraphy, however the horizontal continuity of the middle dolomite unit as well as its effectiveness as a confining unit in the study area are not well known. The stations were spaced at distances ranging from 0.18 to 2.6 km, and yielded 72 cross-correlation Green’s functions for Rayleigh wave propagation at frequencies between 0.2 and 40 Hz, with dominant peaks around 0.8 Hz, 3 Hz and 13 Hz. Local vehicle traffic did interfere to a degree with the correlation of the diffuse waves, but was minimized by using only nighttime data. At the lowest frequencies (greatest depths) investigated, velocities increase with depth; however, correlations become less coherent at higher frequencies, perhaps due to shallow complex scattering. Comparison of cross-correlations for all station pairs also indicates spatial variations in velocity. Thus, the method shows promise for characterization of the heterogeneity of the Floridan Aquifer System.",

A study of SO2 and aerosol sulfate downwind of the oil sands region was conducted as part of the FOSSILS campaign in the summer of 2013 to better understand aerosol growth from SO2 oxidation in the presence of hydrocarbons and the distribution of sulfate in size-segregated aerosols. Hydrocarbons present in the atmosphere during the sampling campaign, collected using evacuated canisters, were characterized using a pre-concentration trap coupled to a GC-FID. The results from this campaign will be explored to determine SO2 oxidation pathways and the effects of oxidation products to aerosol formation and growth.",

            "abstract": "We present a timing analysis of the Sun with the NuSTAR hard X-ray (HXR) telescope, searching for transient brightenings / nanoflares in the quiet Sun and active regions. A substantial amount of flare energy goes into accelerating electrons. HXR observations are a crucial tool for understanding this non-thermal emission and the energy release in flares. RHESSI is able to study this emission over many orders of magnitude (active region flares from X-class to A-class microflares), but it cannot detect the emission from smaller events. Such “nanoflares” have been postulated as a possible source of coronal heating and their existence and relationship to larger flares is still uncertain. In order to detect these events in HXRs, instruments more sensitive than RHESSI are required. Launched in 2012, the astrophysics mission NuSTAR uses focusing optics to directly image X-rays between ~2-80 keV. Although not optimized for solar observations, NuSTAR’s highly sensitive imaging spectroscopy will be used to search for the faintest X-ray emission from the Sun. These solar observations will begin in September 2014; here we present the first results of our search for transient brightenings that could relate to nanoflares.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake sequencing studies allow us to investigate empirical relationships among spatio-temporal parameters describing the complexity of earthquake properties. We have recently studied the relevance of Markov chain models to draw information from global earthquake catalogues. In these studies, we have considered directed graphs as graph theoretic representation of the Markov chain model, and their properties. Here, we look at earthquake sequencing itself as a directed graph. In general, earthquakes are occurrences resulting from significant stress-interactions among faults. As a result, stress-field fluctuations evolve continuously. We propose that they are akin to the dynamics of the collective behaviour of weakly-coupled non-linear oscillators. Since mapping of global stress-field fluctuations in real time at all scales is an impossible task, we consider an earthquake zone as a proxy for a collection of weakly-coupled oscillators the dynamics of which would befit the ubiquitous Kuramoto model. In the present work, we apply the Kuramoto model to understand the non-linear dynamics on a directed graph of a sequence of earthquakes. For directed graphs with certain properties, the Kuramoto model yields synchronization and inclusion of non-local effects evokes the occurrence of chimera states or the co-existence of synchronous and asynchronous behaviour of oscillators. In this presentation, we show how we build the model for both synthetic networks honouring different orders and average degrees, differing asymmetries and network heterogeneity and directed graphs derived from global seismicity data. Then, we present conditions under which chimera states could occur and subsequently, point out the role of Kuramoto model in understanding the evolution of synchronous and asynchronous regions. We interpret our results using spectral properties of directed graphs.",

Observations include those with large viewing zenith angles (up to 83.1), making the measurements very sensitive to aerosol scattering. A previous study by the authors shows the ratioing of CO2 and O2 slant column densities (SCDs) can largely cancel the effect of aerosol scattering, but biases still exist due to the wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering.\nIn this study, biases caused by different types of aerosols are analyzed. Preliminary results indicate that the information from CLARS-FTS spectra is not sufficient to constrain all the free parameters, including the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA), aerosol optical depth, surface albedo, etc. In order to mitigate the influence of aerosol scattering, a few effective aerosol parameters are retrieved simultaneously with absorbing gas abundances. The corrected SCDs show reasonable variabilities from the morning to the afternoon in the presence of aerosols. The column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) products are compared to measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) at Caltech. By retrieving aerosol parameters in the CO2 and O2 absorption bands, biases in XCO2 caused by wavelength dependence of aerosol scattering can be considerably reduced.",

            "abstract": "River systems play an integral role in the global carbon cycle by connecting the terrestrial biosphere, the atmosphere and the oceans. Extensive tropical wetland systems, such as those found in the Amazon region, have been shown to export significant amounts of carbon to river waters as dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be transported and emitted hundreds of km downstream. The assessment of both regional and global carbon budgets could therefore be improved by quantifying these lateral carbon fluxes, especially from highly productive temporarily or permanently flooded areas where substantial CO2 evasion from inland waters can occur.\nThe Nile is the longest river in the world and the headwaters are located in the extensive Papyrus dominated wetlands in central Africa that are associated with Lake Victoria. From its source the White Nile flows northwards through wetlands in Uganda and Sudan before it joins the Blue Nile. Papyrus wetlands have been shown to be some of the most productive global ecosystems, with recorded rates of aerial net primary productivity of up to 3.09 kg C m-2 yr-1. In addition, where anaerobic conditions occur they also accumulate large amounts of carbon in the form of peat, and under these circumstances they represent a significant carbon sink. However, as water moves through these wetlands and is exchanged with surrounding rivers and lakes significant quantities of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon as well as suspended particulate organic matter are exported, which are either released further downstream by degassing, decomposition or deposition.\nWe describe here our attempts to constrain the carbon cycle of wetlands at the Nile headwaters and provide more information on the regional scale carbon budget.",

            "abstract": "The Plio-Pleistocene was a time of global climate cooling: a transition from a state of significant and prolonged climate warmth (Mid Pliocene) to a state of bi-polar glacials (Pleistocene), marked by the onset and intensification of continental ice sheets in the Northern hemisphere (Late Pliocene) and the reorganization of glacial cycle amplitude and frequencies (Mid Pleistocene Transition). This is an interesting and important chapter of climate history for understanding the sensitivity of large ice sheets to perturbations in the climate system on glacial-interglacial and much longer timescales. Of possible priming mechanisms (incl. closure of Panama seaway, orographic uplift), the decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide is considered to have a strong connection with the late Pliocene cooling and ice sheet inception, although the causal mechanism for its decline remains relatively unknown. High-resolution, long term climate records are necessary to further constrain the timings of ice volume evolution and the associated driving factors during the Plio-Pleistocene, however such records are presently limited.\nODP Site 1123 (Chatham Rise, southwest Pacific, 3290m) records the evolution of the deep western boundary current of the southwest Pacific, a primary feeder of Antarctic Bottom Water to the global deep ocean. By calculating the oxygen stable isotope composition of past seawater, a proxy calculation combining Mg/Ca-palaeothermometry and δ18O from benthic foraminifera, we present a high-resolution record of global ice volume as a measure of climate change, extending the existing 0-1.5 Ma record (Elderfield et al., 2012) at ODP 1123 to the Plio-Pleistocene (1.5-3.0 Ma). We use this measure of global ice volume evolution to assess the relative timing and magnitude of northern hemisphere glaciation and concomitant deep ocean temperature decline, which aids to infer temperatures around Antarctica during this time. Deep ocean temperature results show high frequency glacial-cycles, approaching near-freezing temperatures at peak glacials.\n",

            "abstract": "Building on previous environmental flow discussions and a growing recognition that geomorphic and ecological processes are inherent to river functionality and biodiversity, we propose a functional flows approach to managing rivers in contemporary modified riverscapes. The approach focuses on retaining specific functional flows or process-based components of the hydrograph in managed systems, including: peak magnitude flows, recession (seasonal transition) flows, dry season low flows, wet season initiation flows, and interannual variability based on climate. Using a series of case studies and specific examples, we illustrate the importance of each key functional flow. In order to maximize the functionality of these flows and thereby maximize aquatic diversity, restoration of channel-floodplain connectivity and sediment transport processes must be enhanced in both space and time. We further provide considerations for managers that include five guiding principles for developing a functional flows approach or incorporating functional flows into existing environmental flow frameworks. We suggest this approach allows for the development of flow regimes that encompass ecosystem processes alongside varied human needs and can be applied in an adaptive management framework allowing for adjustment in non-stationary river environments.",

Evaluation is performed on six hindcast simulations and eleven simulations driven by four global climate models (GCMs). In places removed from the influence of complex topography in the winter, such as the Midwest of the United States, extremes and associated patterns are generally simulated with high fidelity. In other cases, such as for much of the Gulf of Mexico Coast in summer, the RCMs have notable difficulty in reproducing temperature extremes and associated meteorological patterns. In some cases, the temperature extremes appear to be well reproduced, but for the wrong reasons, making this analysis particularly valuable for diagnosing and interpreting RCM skill in making future projections of temperature extremes. An RCM skill score is developed, based on pattern agreement at all grid cells, to identify the RCM-GCM combinations that may be best suited for making future projections of temperature extremes. Cases identified as having low RCM skill will be the subject of further investigations with a focus on understanding key processes that are contributing to model error and helping to guide future model development. It is anticipated that this work will be implemented as part of a framework for evaluating temperature extremes in RCMs, providing generalized performance metrics based on mechanistic and process-oriented diagnostics.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet in recent decades have shown significant losses at the coastal margins through the thinning, speed-up and retreat of tidewater glaciers. Ocean forcing, via melting of submerged ice at the calving fronts of tidewater glaciers, has been identified as a possible driver of this behaviour. Such submarine melting may provide a significant direct contribution to the negative mass balance of the glacier and could also amplify calving rates. Quantification of submarine melting remains uncertain however since modelling of fjord circulation and submarine melting is challenging, hydrographic data from pro-glacial fjords are sparse and direct observation of submarine melting at a tidewater glacier has so far proved impossible.\nHere, we compare submarine melt rates obtained using buoyant plume theory to those from a numerical model (MITgcm), finding reasonable agreement between the two methods. We then use buoyant plume theory, due to its faster computational speed, to investigate the dependence of melt rate on subglacial discharge, subglacial channel size (and thus emerging flow velocity) and fjord-water temperature. Finally we apply the theory to real tidewater glaciers, finding significant gaps between modelled melt rates and those estimated from hydrographic data. We discuss possible reasons for such disagreements and their implications for constraining the importance of submarine melting to tidewater glacier mass balance.",

            "abstract": "Deforestation fires in the Amazon Basin abound during the dry season (July to October) and are mostly associated with “slash and burn” agricultural practices. Understory fires occur when fires escape from deforested areas into neighboring standing forests; they spread slowly below the canopy, affecting areas that may be comparable or even larger than clear-cut areas. The interannual variabilities of understory fires and deforestation rates appear to be uncorrelated. Areas burned in understory fires are particularly extensive during droughts. Because they progress below a canopy of living trees, understory fires and their effects are not as easily identifiable from space as deforestation fires.\nHere we analyze satellite remote sensing products for CO and fire to investigate differences between deforestation fires and understory fires in the Amazon Basin under varying climatic conditions. The MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere) instrument on board NASA's Terra satellite has been measuring tropospheric CO since 2000, providing the longest global CO record to date. IASI (the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) A and B are two instruments on board METOP-A and -B, respectively, measuring, among others, CO since 2006 and 2012. MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites provide, among other products, a daily record of fires and their effects since 2000 and 2002, respectively. The temporal extent of all these datasets allows for the detailed analysis of drought versus non-drought years. Initial results indicate that MOPITT CO emissions during the dry season peaked in 2005, 2007, and 2010. Those were draught years and coincide with peaks in area affected by understory fires.",

A 15 µL dilute suspension of soda-lime glass particles in oil (2% by mass) were released into the fracture. Particle swarms were illuminated using a green (525 nm) LED array and imaged with a CCD camera.\nThe presence of the additional boundaries modified the speed of the particle swarms (see figure). In Case 1, enhanced swarm transport was observed for a range of apertures, traveling faster than either very small or very large apertures. In Case 2, swarm velocities were enhanced over a larger range of fracture apertures than in any of the other cases. Case 3 shifted the enhanced transport regime to lower apertures and also reduced swarm speed when compared to Case 2. Finally, Case 4 eliminated the enhanced transport regime entirely.\nCommunication between the fluid in the fracture and an external fluid reservoir resulted in enhanced swarm transport in Cases 1-3. The non-rigid nature of a swarm enables drag from the fracture walls to modify the swarm geometry. The particles composing a swarm reorganize in response to the fracture, elongating the swarm and maintaining its density. Unlike a drop or solid sphere, fracture boundaries do not exclusively decelerate swarm motion but instead produce enhanced swarm transport.\nAcknowledgments: This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Geosciences Research Program under Award Number (DE-FG02-09ER16022).",

            "abstract": "Significant oxidation chemistry occurs in the atmosphere in and above forests. In forests where levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are low, this chemistry is influenced primarily by the emissions and chemistry of highly reactive Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs), which both destroy hydroxyl (OH, the main oxidant), and may produce it. Quantifying OH in forest environments is crucial to a proper understanding of the specific oxidation mechanisms taking place. In some other low-NOx / high-BVOC environments, OH measurements have been found to be several times higher than predicted by models, leading to concern that perhaps the current BVOC oxidation mechanisms are missing some OH-producing chemistry. The Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) presents an excellent opportunity to closely examine these mechanisms as well as the recycling of OH thanks to its extensive suite of measurements taken in an Alabama forest during summer 2013. OH and HO2 measurements made with the Ground-based Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS) are compared to the results of a photochemical box model constrained by the other measurements taken at SOAS. For this presentation, we examine the discrepancy between the measurements and the model output and discuss potential sources for this discrepancy.",

            "abstract": "Drought is an ever growing concern within the United States and Mexico. Extended periods of below-average precipitation can adversely affect agricultural production and ecosystems, impact local water resources and create conditions prime for wildfire. DroughtView (www.droughtview.arizona.edu) is a new on-line resource for scientists, natural resource managers, and the public that brings a new perspective to remote-sensing based drought impact assessment that is not currently available. DroughtView allows users to monitor the impact of drought on vegetation cover for the entire continental United States and the northern regions of Mexico. As a spatially and temporally dynamic geospatial decision support tool, DroughtView is an excellent educational introduction to the relationship between remotely sensed vegetation condition and drought. The system serves up Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data generated from 250 meter 16-day composite Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2000 to the present. Calculation of difference from average, previous period and previous year greenness products provide the user with a proxy for drought conditions and insight on the secondary impacts of drought, such as wildfire. The various image products and overlays are served up via the ArcGIS Server platform. DroughtView serves as a useful tool to introduce and teach vegetation time series analysis to those unfamiliar with the science. High spatial resolution imagery is available as a reference layer to locate points of interest, zoom in and export images for implementation in reports and presentations. Animation of vegetation time series allows users to examine ecosystem disturbances and climate data is also available to examine the relationship between precipitation, temperature and vegetation. The tool is mobile friendly allowing users to access the system while in the field. The systems capabilities and applications will be demonstrated live during the poster session. Expansion of DroughtView includes future plans to add snow products, phenology data and climate scenarios. Extension of the spatial coverage of the data to other parts of the world is also planned.",

The network is a multi-national collaboration consisting of 46 newly constructed continuous Global Positioning Systems (cGPS) and 21 refurbished existing GPS stations, all co-located with meteorological sensors. One recommendation of the COCONet working group was to improve the vertical reference frame for long-term sea level monitoring. A COCONet supplement was awarded by the NSF to further address this particular objective through the co-location of GPS and tide gauges. This COCOnet infrastructure, along with the new tide gauges, will have broad scientific implications for hazards mitigation, solid earth, and atmospheric science research.\nUNAVCO engineers have meet with members of the Caribbean tide gauge community to establish target locations and design station layout. Allocated NSF funds allow for the construction of two complete new tide gauge systems each with two complimentary cGPS. Following the recommendations of NOAA and the sea level monitoring community, the two “new” locales will be Port Royal, Jamaica and Puerto Morelos, Mexico. Both locations had previously existing, but currently non-operational tide gauges. UNAVCO engineers will install a Sutron Radar Level Recorder and a backup pressure sensor tide gauge with GOES satellite telemetry. Tide data will be freely available by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org).\nThe NSF supplement also provided funds for adding cGPS to two additional locations where currently functioning tide gauge systems exist. Proposed locations for this additional infrastructure are Barahona, Dominican Republic and Bocas del Toro, Panama. All four locations will feature two standard COCONet cGPS systems consisting of a Trimble Choke Ring GNSS antenna, Trimble NetR9 GPS receiver, and a Vaisala meteorological sensor. All GPS data will be collected, processed and distributed via standard COCONet archiving and processing along with raw meteorological data at coconet.unavco.org.",

            "abstract": "The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) mission has provided for the first time solar spectral irradiance (SSI) observations over a full solar cycle time period with wavelength coverage from the X-ray through the near infrared. This paper will discuss the lessons-learned from SORCE including the need to develop more effective methods to track on-orbit spectroscopic response and sensitivity degradation. This is especially important in using these data products as input to modern day chemistry-climate models that require very broad spectral coverage with moderate-to-high spectral and temporal resolution to constrain the solar component to the atmospheric response. A basic requirement to obtain this essential climate record is to 1) perform preflight radiometric calibrations that are traceable SI standards along with a complete specification of the instruments spectroscopic response, and 2) design the instrument to have the ability to perform instrument-only sensitivity corrections to objectively account for on-orbit degradation. The development of the NIST SIRCUS (National Institute of Science and Technology, Sources for Irradiance and Radiance Calibration with Uniform Sources) now permits the full characterization of the spectral radiometer’s response, and on-orbit degradation characterization through comparisons of redundant detectors and spectrometers appears to be the most practical method to perform these corrections for the near ultraviolet through the near infrared. Going forward, we discuss a compact spectral radiometer development that will couple with advances in CubeSat technology to allow for shorter mission lengths, relatively inexpensive development and launch costs, and reduce the risk of data gaps between successive missions without compromising measurement accuracy. We also discuss the development of a radiometric solar imager that will both greatly improve the interpretation of existing Sun-as-a-star irradiance observations and provide a bridge from our current irradiance capabilities to future high spatial/temporal resolution solar physics assets such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST).",

            "abstract": "The mantle lithosphere beneath the cratonic part of continents is the deepest (> 200 km) and oldest (>2-3 Ga) on Earth, remaining a conundrum as to how these cratonic roots could have resisted delamination by asthenospheric convection over time. Water, or trace H incorporated in mineral defects, could be a key player in the evolution of continental lithosphere because it influences melting and rheology of the mantle [e.g., 1]. Mantle xenoliths from the Lac de Gras kimberlite in the Slave craton [2] were analyzed by FTIR. The cratonic mantle beneath Lac de Gras is stratified with shallow (<145 km) oxidized ultradepleted peridotites and pyroxenites with evidence for carbonatitic metasomatism, underlain by reduced and less depleted peridotites metasomatized by kimberlite melts [3,4]. Peridotites analyzed so far have H2O contents in ppm weight of 7-100 in their olivines, 58 to 255 in their orthopyroxenes (opx), 11 to 84 in their garnet, and 139 in one clinopyroxene. A pyroxenite contains 58 ppm H2O in opx and 5 ppm H2O in its olivine and garnet. Olivine and garnet from the deep peridotites have a range of water contents extending to higher values than those from the shallow ones. The FTIR spectra of olivines from the shallow samples have more prominent Group II OH bands compared to the olivines from the deep samples, consistent with a more oxidized mantle environment [5]. The range of olivine water content is similar to that observed in Kaapvaal craton peridotites at the same depths (129-184 km [1]) but does not extend to as high values as those from Udachnaya (Siberian craton [6]). The Slave, Kaapvaal and Siberian cratons will be compared in terms of water content distribution, controls and role in cratonic root longevity.\n[1] Peslier et al. 2010 Nature 467, 78-81.\n[2] Aulbach et al. 2007 CMP 154, 409-427.\n[3] Creighton et al. 2009 CMP 157, 491-504.\n[4] Aulbach et al. 2013 CG 352, 153-169.\n[5] Bai & Kohlstedt 1993 PCM 19, 460-471.\n[6] Doucet et al. 2014 GCA 137, 159-187.",

            "abstract": "Solar irradiance – both total irradiance and spectral irradiance— are primary climate data variables. Because of absorption and scattering by our intervening atmosphere accurate measurements of the Sun are only realized from space observations beginning in about 1978. The long-term accuracies of the resulting data sets are limited by unidentified and uncertain on-orbit instrument degradation. Nevertheless, from numerous observing programs solar variability has been well established for short and intermediate times scales, with additional clear indications of decadal variability associated with the 11-year solar cycle.\nHow can today’s solar irradiance measurements be reliably compared with those made in the future, and how will the resulting comparison stand the test of time? There is one technique that shows great promise. The Sun is a star — more or less variable like any and all other stars. Stellar astronomers have a technique of establishing a star’s variability with precision of 0.01%, and over arbitrarily long periods of time. From the ground and from space they have success by simply comparing the irradiance of a target star to that of a number of standard stars. (The key here is that there exist many standard stars, and outliers are easily identified and removed from the ensemble.) For stellar comparisons it is straightforward to use a single instrument — same optics and detectors — to observe stars differing by several orders of magnitude in brightness. To observe the Sun and stars with a single instrument is far more problematic as there are easily eight to twelve orders of magnitude differences in brightness.\nThe SOLSTICE (Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment) has now been flown twice — on UARS from 1991 to 2005 and on SORCE from 2003 to the present. The SOLSTICE is an ultraviolet spectral instrument measuring irradiance from 115 nm to 300 nm, and it is intentionally designed to observe both the Sun and selected standard stars. In addition to accommodating more than eight orders of magnitude dynamic range, the SOLSTICE optical design and data analyses must account for subtle differences in the solar and stellar observations. This paper will consider the success and limitations of the SOLSTICE UV irradiance data record.",

            "abstract": "Soils within the McMurdo Dry Valleys are known to respire carbon dioxide (CO2), but considerable debate surrounds the contributing sources and mechanisms that drive temporal variability. While some of the CO2 is of biological origin, other known contributors to variability include geochemical sources within, or beneath, the soil column. The relative contribution from each of these sources will depend on seasonal and environmental drivers such as temperature and wind that exert influence on temporal dynamics. To supplement a long term CO2­ surface flux monitoring station that has now recorded fluxes over three full annual cycles, in January 2014 an automated flux and depth concentration monitoring system was installed in the Spaulding Pond area of Taylor Valley, along with standard meteorological sensors, to assist in defining source contributions through time. During two weeks of data we observed marked diel variability in CO2 concentrations within the profile (~100 ppm CO2 above or below atmospheric), and of CO2 moving across the soil surface. The pattern at many depths suggested an alternating diel-scale transition from source to sink that seemed clearly correlated with temperature-driven changes in the solubility of CO2 in water films. This CO2 solution storage flux was very highly coupled to soil temperature. A small depth source of unknown origin also appeared to be present. A controlled laboratory soil experiment was conducted to confirm the magnitude of fluxes into and out of soil water films, and confirmed the field results and temperature dependence. Ultimately, this solution storage flux needs to be well understood if the small biological fluxes from these soils are to be properly quantified and monitored for change. Here, we present results from the 2013/2014 field season and these supplementary experiments, placed in the context of 3 year long term continuous measurement of soil CO2 flux within the Dry Valleys.",

Numerous studies have analyzed the effects of parametric and/or structural uncertainties in IAMs, but uncertainties regarding the problem formulation are often overlooked. Here we use the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) to analyze the effects of uncertainty surrounding the problem formulation. The standard DICE model adopts a single objective to maximize a weighted sum of utilities of per-capita consumption. Decisionmakers, however, may be concerned with a broader range of values and preferences that are not captured by this a priori definition of utility. We reformulate the problem by introducing three additional objectives that represent values such as (i) reliably limiting global average warming to two degrees Celsius and minimizing both (ii) the costs of abatement and (iii) the damages due to climate change. We derive a set of Pareto-optimal solutions over which decisionmakers can trade-off and assess performance criteria a posteriori. We illustrate the potential for myopia in the traditional problem formulation and discuss the capability of this multiobjective formulation to provide decision support.",

            "abstract": "We present a travel time formulation of water and energy transport at sub-catchment scale, resulting in a closed form solution for water temperature evolution in the subsoil compartment. The derived equations are implemented in Alpine3D, a physically-based model of snow processes, which provides the necessary boundary conditions to perform hydro-thermal response simulations of Alpine catchments. The model set-up accounts for advective and non-advective energy fluxes to perform spatially distributed simulations of streamflow and temperature in river networks having an arbitrary degree of geomorphological complexity. The model performance is illustrated comparing modeled and measured hydrographs and thermographs at the outlet of the Dischma catchment (45 km2) in the Swiss Alps. The model gives reliable predictions of streamflow and temperature. Our results suggest that the advective energy fluxes provide a large contribution to the thermal regime of the study catchment. The non-advective energy fluxes are also influential, as they contribute to cool the water in the winter and to warm it in the summer. The analysis of the distributed model results shows a notable streamflow spatial variability during a snowmelt event, as opposed to a more homogeneous response during a rainfall event. The stream temperature, instead, progressively increases from headwater streams to the outlet both during the snowmelt and the rainfall events. The proposed model completes the surface processes simulation framework of Alpine3D. The relevance of the work stems from the increasing scientific interest concerning the impacts of the warming climate on water resources management and temperature-influenced ecological processes.",

            "abstract": "Web-crawling, a core component of the NSF-funded BCube project, is researching and applying the use of big data technologies to find and characterize different types of web services, catalog interfaces, and data feeds such as the ESIP OpenSearch, OGC W*S, THREDDS, and OAI-PMH that describe or provide access to scientific datasets.\nGiven the scale of the Internet, which challenges even large search providers such as Google, the BCube plan for discovering these web accessible services is to subdivide the problem into three smaller, more tractable issues. The first, to be able to discover likely sites where relevant data and data services might be found, the second, to be able to deeply crawl the sites discovered to find any data and services which might be present. Lastly, to leverage the use of semantic technologies to characterize the services and data found, and to filter out everything but those relevant to the geosciences.\nTo address the first two challenges BCube uses an adapted version of Apache Nutch (which originated Hadoop), a web scale crawler, and Amazon’s ElasticMapReduce service for flexibility and cost effectiveness. For characterization of the services found, BCube is examining existing web service ontologies for their applicability to our needs and will re-use and/or extend these in order to query for services with specific well-defined characteristics in scientific datasets such as the use of geospatial namespaces.\nThe original proposal for the crawler won a grant from Amazon’s academic program, which allowed us to become operational; we successfully tested the Bcube Crawler at web scale obtaining a significant corpus, sizeable enough to enable work on characterization of the services and data found. There is still plenty of work to be done, doing “smart crawls” by managing the frontier, developing and enhancing our scoring algorithms and fully implementing the semantic characterization technologies. We describe the current status of the project, our successes and issues encountered.\nThe final goal of the BCube crawler project is to provide relevant data services to other projects on the EarthCube stack and third party partners so they can be brokered and used by a wider scientific community.",

            "abstract": "Lagrangian air mass tracking programs in back cast mode are a powerful tool for estimating the water vapor source of precipitation events. The altitudes above the precipitation site where particle’s back trajectories begin influences the source estimation. We assume that precipitation comes from water vapor in condensing regions of the air column, so particles are placed in proportion to an estimated condensation profile. We compare two methods for estimating where condensation occurs and the resulting evaporation sites for 63 events at Barrow, AK. The first method (M1) uses measurements from a 35 GHz vertically resolved cloud radar (MMCR), and algorithms developed by Zhao and Garrett1 to calculate precipitation rate. The second method (M2) uses the Global Data Assimilation System reanalysis data in a lofting model. We assess how accurately M2, developed for global coverage, will perform in absence of direct cloud observations. Results from the two methods are statistically similar. The mean particle height estimated by M2 is, on average, 695 m (s.d. = 1800 m) higher than M1. The corresponding average vapor source estimated by M2 is 1.5⁰ (s.d. = 5.4⁰) south of M1. In addition, vapor sources for M2 relative to M1 have ocean surface temperatures averaging 1.1⁰C (s.d. = 3.5⁰C) warmer, and reported ocean surface relative humidities 0.31% (s.d. = 6.1%) drier. All biases except the latter are statistically significant (p = 0.02 for each). Results were skewed by events where M2 estimated very high altitudes of condensation. When M2 produced an average particle height less than 5000 m (89% of events), M2 estimated mean particle heights 76 m (s.d. = 741 m) higher than M1, corresponding to a vapor source 0.54⁰ (s.d. = 4.2⁰) south of M1. The ocean surface at the vapor source was an average of 0.35⁰C (s.d. = 2.35⁰C) warmer and ocean surface relative humidities were 0.02% (s.d. = 5.5%) wetter. None of the biases was statistically significant. If the vapor source meteorology estimated by M2 is used to determine vapor isotopic properties it would produce results similar to M1 in all cases except the occasional very high cloud. The methods strive to balance a sufficient number of tracked air masses for meaningful vapor source estimation with minimal computational time.\nZhao, C and Garrett, T.J. 2008, J. Geophys. Res. ",

            "abstract": "Stratus clouds provide summer moisture and shade for ecological and human systems in coastal Southern California (CSCA). Subtropical marine clouds such as those in CSCA also regulate earth’s energy budget. Uncertainties in how these clouds respond to global warming contribute to uncertain projections of local and global climate. We use hourly cloud-height observations from 22 airfields in CSCA to develop records of summer stratus cloudiness (cloud base <1000 m) since 1948. We dissect these records by hour, altitude, and location to diagnose interannual variability and multi-decade trends. We find that low and high stratus clouds are promoted by distinct climate processes. Low stratus, including fog, is promoted by a cool surface and warmth aloft, enhancing stability above the marine layer. High stratus (cloud base: 600–1000 m) is promoted by synoptic frontal systems that reduce stability throughout the atmosphere. Additionally, fog (very low stratus clouds) frequency has declined during the past ~60 years by over 50% at night and in early morning at some sites, but has not changed at others. Fog reductions appear linked to urbanization. Among the 22 airfields, trends in fogginess correlate negatively (r = -0.84) with the percent of urban cover within 10 km. The mechanism linking urban cover to fog reduction is nighttime warming. Relatively urban sites experienced more rapid nighttime warming since 1948 (r = 0.90) and have lower relative humidity as a result (r = -0.71). Decreased relative humidity causes condensation level to lift, increasing cloud height and reducing fog frequency. Intriguingly, fog frequency increased by 50–75% on the nearby, non-urbanized Channel Islands. Increased fogginess is consistent with secular warming above the marine layer, which has thus far occurred without local sea-surface warming. We conclude that trends toward a potentially foggier climate have been counteracted, and overwhelmed, by artificial nighttime warming in much of CSCA.",

            "abstract": "Risk management in water resources has relied on reducing randomness and smoothing variability. Watersheds are engineered to avoid small but frequent flood events or water shortages - this is the hallmark of a robust system. However, the artificial reduction of natural variability in hydrology creates an increasingly fragile watershed. Invisible risk accumulates each year that the system performs within its design capacity, as development expands into hazard areas and community preparedness and consciousness for the hazard is reduced in its absence. While the benefits of these behaviors are immediate and visible, exposure to catastrophic risk grows invisibly under the surface.\nWe consider risk as the probability of an adverse event and its consequence. Increasing exposure to risk in engineered watersheds is typically driven by increasing the consequences for equally probable events, as the same magnitude flood causes more damage. However, changing climate and land use alters hydrology such that large flooding is more probable. Uncertainty in assessing the probability or consequence of these events is increased by anthropogenic change.\nRobust systems with a fixed capacity become less reliable in a changing environment. Communities will require resilient, adaptable measures for reducing current and future potential risk exposure. Resilient measures – such as floodplain management and integrated water resources management - will require some amount of concession to damage from small but frequent detrimental events in order to reduce the risk of catastrophe.",

            "abstract": "Litter decomposition links terrestrial primary productivity to soil organic matter (OM) dynamics, by determining the quantity and chemical characteristics of plant-derived material entering the soil system. The controls on and products of litter decomposition form a foundation for the role of terrestrial ecosystems in global C cycling (i.e. as sinks or sources), by determining the contribution of plant productivity to atmospheric CO2 through respiration versus to soil OM as direct plant or biologically processed material. We identified two areas in need of theoretical development in litter decomposition models. First, current litter decomposition models are generally based on litter mass loss and CO2 flux, an approach which does not consider leaching and the generation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from litter decomposition. Second, new hypotheses for the role of variable microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) have important implications for the form and quantity of litter decomposition products- specifically, respiration of CO2 versus the formation of microbes, microbial products, and DOM. We propose the Litter Decomposition and Leaching (LIDEL) model as a new theoretical approach to litter decomposition that 1) includes explicit modeling of DOM as a litter decomposition product, and 2) dynamically links substrate chemistry with variable CUE and the generation of DOM and other litter decomposition products. We parameterized the model using Bayesian calibration, based on a random-walk Metropolis Hastings within Gibbs Sampling Markov Chain-Monte Carlo algorithm. This Bayesian analysis uses litter decomposition and leaching experimental data for five litter types that vary by lignin and nitrogen content. By separating the dynamics of lignin versus microbial products as well as CO2 versus DOM partitioning during litter decomposition, the LIDEL model clarifies the linkage between litter chemistry, microbial CUE, and SOM inputs from litter. We suggest the LIDEL model can be implemented in ecosystem models such as DAYCENT, as a better representation of above and below ground litter decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Currently implemented Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) algorithms based on seismic data alone should provide the most robust warnings for most M<6 earthquakes, since real-time GPS positions are too noisy to aid in EEW. However, for larger events, which generate larger fault offsets, GPS data can provide a direct on-scale displacement measurements and has sufficient precision. In such situations, the GPS observations may enable more accurate estimation of magnitude and rupture extent than seismic data.\nThe USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park currently obtains real-time data from approximately 100 GNSS stations in northern California. These stations, which span the San Andreas fault system from the Mendocino Triple Junction to San Juan Bautista, are operated by USGS-Menlo Park, UC Berkeley, and UNAVCO. We have developed software tools for monitoring and troubleshooting data acquisition and quality. We have evaluated the latency and precision of position estimates obtained through real-time processing and we have found these results satisfactory for EEW.\nWe are now implementing the BEFORES algorithm (Minson et al., 2014) that uses Bayesian analysis to determine the best-fitting coseismic fault orientation and finite fault slip distribution (from which moment and rupture extent are obtained) in real-time. BEFORES has been tested extensively on both simulated and real data (retrospectively) for a variety of earthquakes. We are now focusing on three aspects of its implementation: 1) receiving real-time earthquake locations from independent seismic EEW algorithms, that are obtained through multiple TCP/IP connections, and 3) optimizing the computation of elastic Green’s functions. Completion of these tasks plus additional tests using simulated waveforms of earthquakes displacements superimposed on actual data will prepare the algorithm for implementation in the West Coast EEW system.",

            "abstract": "Gnamma pit is an Australian aboriginal term for weathering pit, and its formation is controlled by a mix of mineral decay and eolian processes. Prior literature suggests that two processes limit pit growth: decay along grain boundaries sufficient to allow mineral detachment; and eolian events sufficient to deflate accumulate minerals. However, prior literature contains little empirical data on the nature of these processes. Our research focuses on developing a better understanding of wind thresholds that deflate particles from pits. A set of wind-tunnel tests with a range of weathering pit shapes and grus particle sizes explored the wind threshold needed to deflate particles in different situations. An empirical equation expresses the way to estimate wind the speed threshold via pit depth and particle size. With this equation, the threshold for evacuating particles in the pit can be estimated by measuring the pit depth and smallest particles in the weathering pit, that indicates that the wind speed would not exceed this value when this pit is still active. We also developed a computational fluid dynamics model to investigate the distribution of wall shear stress. Ultimately, there exists some potential to utilize our refined understanding of gnamma pits as an indicator of paleo-wind intensity in pit locations where the accumulated sediment can be dated (e.g., by OSL) and such filled pits excavated to understand the paleo-wind conditions that would have once allowed the growth of such a pit.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is the region where surface water and groundwater interact beneath and adjacent to stream and river systems. The hyporheic zone has been shown to affect water quality constituents such as heat, pollutants, and nutrients in this interfacial region. Recent modeling studies have shown that some compounds upwelling from groundwater toward surface water only react when water originating in surface water and groundwater mix at the edge of the hyporheic zone. These “mixing-dependent” reactions may be important for addressing upwelling pollution, yet depend on the extent of the mixing zone. Recent modeling studies have also shown this mixing zone to be thin, but this has not been confirmed in lab or field studies. Our current study took the first step toward such confirmation by simulating mixing between hyporheic flow cells and upwelling groundwater in a 1.7 m x 1m flow-through laboratory sediment mesocosm. We used tracer dyes and digital photographs taken through the glass wall of the mesocosm to quantify mixing zone thickness. We varied key hydraulic controls such as the surface water head drop that drives the hyporheic flow cells. Steady-state results confirm the thin mixing zones predicted by the earlier modeling. Mixing zone length increases with increasing surface water head drop, but mixing zone thickness appears to remain relatively constant. Furthermore, if the head drop in surface water changes rapidly, the mixing zone moves through riverbed sediments but does not appear to change appreciably in thickness. As a result, we conclude that mixing zones are probably thin under a range of field conditions. This has implications for one common definition of the hyporheic zone as an area of substantial mixing of surface water and groundwater. Thin mixing zones also may limit mixing-dependent reactions of upwelling contaminants, which bears further study.",

            "abstract": "The internal layer stratigraphy of polar ice sheets revealed by airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) contains valuable information about past ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. Internal layers in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are considered to be isochrones and are continuous over several hundreds of kilometres. In contrast, internal layers in Canadian Arctic ice caps appear to be very heterogeneous and fragmentary, consisting of highly discontinuous layers that can be traced over only a few to several tens of kilometres.\nInternal layers most likely relate to former ice surfaces (the upper few meters of snow/firn), the properties which are directly influenced by atmospheric conditions including the air temperature, precipitation rate, and prevailing wind pattern. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous and complex nature of layers in the Canadian Arctic results from highly variable snow and firn conditions at the surface. Characterizing surface properties such as variations in the snow/firn density from dry to wet snow/firn, as well as high-density shallow ice layers and lenses of refrozen water can help to elucidate the complex internal layer pattern in the Canadian Arctic ice caps.\nEstimates of the snow/firn surface density and roughness can be derived from reflectance and scattering information using the surface radar returns from RES measurements. Here we present estimates of the surface snow/firn density distribution over Devon Ice Cap in the Canadian Arctic derived by the Radar Statistical Reconnaissance (RSR) methodology (Grima et al., 2014, Planetary & Space Sciences) using data collected by recent airborne radar sounding programs. The RSR generates estimates of the statistical distribution of surface echo amplitudes over defined areas along a survey transect. The derived distributions are best-fitted with a theoretical stochastic envelope, parameterized with the signal reflectance and scattering, in order to separate those two components. Finally, the signal reflectance and scattering components are used in a backscattering model to invert for the distribution of the surface density and roughness generating the observed surface echo amplitudes.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems are influenced by both abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors, such as variation in meteorological conditions, directly drive biophysical and biogeochemical processes; biotic factors, referring to the inherent properties of the ecosystem components, reflect the internal regulating effects including temporal dynamics and memory. The magnitude of the effect of abiotic and biotic factors on forest ecosystem carbon exchange has been suggested to vary at different time scales. In this study, we design and conduct a model-data fusion experiment to investigate the role and relative importance of the biotic and abiotic factors for inter-annual variability of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of temperate deciduous forest ecosystems in the Northeastern US. A process-based model (FöBAAR) is parameterized at four eddy-covariance sites using all available flux and biometric measurements. We conducted a “transplant” modeling experiment, that is, cross- site and parameter simulations with different combinations of site meteorology and parameters. Using wavelet analysis and variance partitioning techniques, analysis of model predictions identifies both spatial variant and spatially invariant parameters. Variability of NEE was primarily modulated by gross primary productivity (GPP), with relative contributions varying from hourly to yearly time scales. The inter-annual variability of GPP and NEE is more regulated by meteorological forcing, but spatial variability in certain model parameters (biotic response) has more substantial effects on the inter-annual variability of ecosystem respiration (Reco) through the effects on carbon pools. Both the biotic and abiotic factors play significant roles in modulating the spatial and temporal variability in terrestrial carbon cycling in the region. Together, our study quantifies the relative importance of both, and calls for better understanding of them to better predict regional CO2 exchanges.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that ambient ground motion within the 1 s to 10 s period range (including the so-called secondary microseism peak) is caused by ocean wave interactions that induce pressure fluctuations at the ocean floor through acoustic waves. In recent years, numerical ocean wave models have successfully predicted the maximum amplitude of the secondary microseism peak in the 4 s to 8 s range, where seismic energy is mainly caused by the interaction of ocean swells of typically 8 s to 16 s of periods, i.e. 100-400 m wavelengths, that travel in opposite directions as they are generated by distant storms, by single but fast moving storms or by coastal reflections.\nIn contrast, little attention has been devoted to the contribution of local wind generated seas characterized by shorter period waves (1 s to 3 s ocean waves, i.e. 1-10 m wavelengths) in the generation of higher frequency seismic noise in coastal regions. While this noise content is becoming increasingly used by seismologists, for example for high resolution ground imaging from dense arrays, its absolute amplitude and frequency dependence has not yet been consistently predicted: this is the purpose of this talk.\nWe present a simple analytical approach that allows the prediction of ambient seismic noise recorded on land in the 0.5 s to 3 s range from knowledge of the local wind field operating on the surrounding ocean. Ocean waves and their interactions are accounted for within hundreds of kilometers from coastal seismic stations, and a realistic ground structure is considered in the generation and propagation of Rayleigh waves. We show that the amplitude and frequency scaling of hourly noise spectra can be systematically predicted, and thus suggest that seismic stations can complement in-situ measurements in inferring wind sea properties in coastal regions.\nFurthermore, we use our new approach to demonstrate that seismic stations deployed on land can be used to remotely study ocean waves in sea ice environments, which is a topic of growing interest due to the role of ocean waves in the current decline of sea ice. We show that sea ice mechanical changes can be monitored at daily timescales using our framework. Our ongoing work consists in combining seismic observations with satellite observations of sea ice concentration and thickness to extract sea ice mechanical strength.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale, real-time, sensor-driven analytics are a highly effective set of tools in many research environments; however, the barrier to entry is expensive and the learning curve is steep. These systems need to operate efficiently from end to end, with the key aspects being data transmission, acquisition, management and organization, and retrieval. When building a generic multidisciplinary platform, acquisition and data management needs to be designed with scalability and flexibility as the primary focus. Additionally, in order to leverage current sensor web technologies, the integration of common sensor data standards (ie. SensorML and SWE Services) should be supported. Perhaps most important, researchers should be able to get started and integrate the platform into their set of research tools as easily and quickly as possible.\nThe largest issue with current platforms is that the sensor data must be formed and described using the previously mentioned standards. As useful as these standards are for organizing data, they are cumbersome to adopt, often restrictive, and are required to be geospatially-driven.\nOur solution, RTEMP (Real-time Environment Monitoring Platform), is a real-time analytics platform with over ten years and an estimated two million dollars of investment. It has been developed for our continuously expanding requirements of operating and building remote sensors and supporting equipment for space physics research. A key benefit of our approach is RTEMP’s ability to manage agnostic data. This allows data that flows through the system to be structured in any way that best addresses the needs of the sensor operators and data users, enabling extensive flexibility and streamlined development and research.\nHere we begin with an overview of RTEMP and how it is structured. Additionally, we will showcase the ways that we are using RTEMP and how it is being adopted by researchers in an increasingly broad range of other research fields. We will lay out a roadmap describing our path forward in the development of RTEMP over the next year, including the anticipated incorporation of new in line analytics for carrying out feature extraction and autonomous decision making “on the fly”. Our goal, within a year, is to be operating the world’s first true sensor web (as opposed to sensor network) for geospace research.",

            "abstract": "Caribbean reefs changed profoundly in taxonomic composition, diversity, and dominance structure during late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic change. These changes coincide with protracted climatic deterioration and cooling between 2.0 to 0.8 Ma, and the onset of high amplitude sea-level fluctuations ~400 ka. The Dominican Republic Drilling Project (DRDP) was initiated to determine how climate change and global high-amplitude sea level changes influenced depositional patterns in Pliocene to Recent reef systems of the Caribbean. A transect of 7 core borings (~700 m total depth) were collected along the southern coast of the DR. New age constraints based on U/Th geochronometry and radiogenic Sr isotopes, combined with depositional lithofacies, faunal indicators, and stable isotope profiles have allowed us to correlate between wells and define the internal anatomy and stratal geometry of the individual reef sigmoids and sigmoid sets. Faunal records suggest most extinction occurred prior to ~1 Ma. Following this extinction, fringing reef margins of the Caribbean display a characteristic zonation in which Acropora palmata dominates shallow high-energy reef crests and Acropora cervicornis calmer fore-reef slopes and backreef lagoons. The dominance of acroporids across this zonation has been attributed to growth rates 5-100 times faster than other corals.",

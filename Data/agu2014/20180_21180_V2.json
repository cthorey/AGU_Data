            "abstract": "Physical soil properties create lags between temperature change and corresponding soil responses, which obscure true Q10 values and other biophysical parameters such as depth of production. This study examines inversion approaches for estimating Q10 and depth of production using physically based soil models, constrained by observed high-frequency surface fluxes and/or concentrations. Our inversion strategy uses, at its base, a 1-D multi-layered soil model that simulates realistic temperature and gas diffusion physics. We tested inversion scenarios on synthetic datasets using a range of constraining parameters, time averaging techniques, mechanisms to improve computational efficiency, and various methods of incorporating real data into the model. Overall, we have found that with carefully constrained datasets, inversion was possible. While inversions using exclusively surface flux measurements could succeed, constraining the inversion using at least one shallow subsurface CO2 measurement proved to be most successful. Precision in modeling soil profile temperature was found to be crucial to the inversion process, along with the frequency of temperature measurements. This was not a surprise, given that temperature is the known determinant of soil lags. This presentation will share the various lessons from this work, and will illustrate these concepts using synthetic and real data. This work is a first step toward building a reliable framework for removing physical effects from high frequency soil CO2 datasets. Ultimately, we hope that this process will lead to better estimates of biophysical soil parameters and their variability on short timescales.",

            "abstract": "Eutrophication has been one of the major threats to the coastal ecosystem. Several factors are believed to be associated with eutrophication, which including the high nutrient loads delivered into the estuary from river. Yangtze river is the longest river in China. It brings huge amount of nutrients into the Yangtze Estuary (YE) and adjacent East China Sea (ECS) and contributes significantly to the eutrophication in estuary and the adjacent waters. The eutrophication in this region exhibits strong seasonal variability, with the worst situation occurring in summer. This seasonal variability might be coupled with the timing of riverine nutrient inputs and physical processes (wind and along-shore current).\nTo study seasonal variability of nutrients (N/P) in YE, a 3D physical-biological coupled model was applied to the YE and its adjacent waters. The physical model was the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) and the biological model was a nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus (NPZD) model. The simulated nutrients distribution pattern was consistent with observation. With the numerical experiments, we examined nutrients transport under different river loads and different physical processes. Seasonal variability of nutrients budget in YE and alone-shelf transport flux were also studied.",

            "abstract": "The mandate is clear for improving communication between models and experiments to better evaluate terrestrial responses to atmospheric and climatic change. Unfortunately, progress in linking experimental and modeling approaches has been slow and sometimes frustrating. Recent successes in linking results from the Duke and Oak Ridge free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments with ecosystem and land surface models – the FACE Model-Data Synthesis (FACE-MDS) project – came only after a period of slow progress, but the experience points the way to future model-experiment interactions.\nAs the FACE experiments were approaching their termination, the FACE research community made an explicit attempt to work together with the modeling community to synthesize and deliver experimental data to benchmark models and to use models to supply appropriate context for the experimental results. Initial problems that impeded progress were: measurement protocols were not consistent across different experiments; data were not well organized for model input; and parameterizing and spinning up models that were not designed for simulating a specific site was difficult. Once these problems were worked out, the FACE-MDS project has been very successful in using data from the Duke and ORNL FACE experiment to test critical assumptions in the models. The project showed, for example, that the stomatal conductance model most widely used in models was supported by experimental data, but models did not capture important responses such as increased leaf mass per unit area in elevated CO2, and did not appropriately represent foliar nitrogen allocation.\nWe now have an opportunity to learn from this experience. New FACE experiments that have recently been initiated, or are about to be initiated, include a eucalyptus forest in Australia; the AmazonFACE experiment in a primary, tropical forest in Brazil; and a mature oak woodland in England. Cross-site science questions are being developed that will have a strong modeling framework, and modelers and experimentalists will work to establish common measurement protocols and data format. By starting the model-experiment connection early and learning from our past experiences, we expect to significantly shorten the time lags between advances in process-oriented studies and large-scale models.",

            "abstract": "CryoSat-2 is ESA's first satellite mission dedicated to measuring changes in the polar land ice and sea ice cover.\nFollowing its launch in April 2010, we have examined the performance of the instrument over the continental ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, the Artic Ocean, and, for the purposes of calibration, over the oceans. We have confirmed the engineering performance at system level of the interferometer demonstrating that it measures across-track surface slopes with a precision of 25 micro-radians and an accuracy of 10 micro-radians, greatly exceeding the pre-launch specifications (100 micro-radians). Over the polar ice sheets, we have examined the performance of the range estimation, and determined the range precision to be 19 cm RMS at 20 Hz. We have examined the retrieval of the phase information over the ice sheets, and found the phase estimates to be robust and little affected by the uncertain ice sheet topography. Based on the calibration of the interferometer, the contribution of the across track slope error is, at 0.4 mm, negligible. Over marine sea ice, we have verified the discrimination of sea ice and ocean lead returns using contemporaneous SAR imagery from ENVISAT, and we have estimated the precision of individual (20 Hz) measurements to be 2 cm. In summary, with the corrected data products, we are able to confirm that the system performance of CryoSat-2 will meet or exceed its specification over the continental and marine ice sheets.\nThis presenetation sumamrises the key outcomes of the mission performance, and presents a series of example case studies where CryoSat-2 data have been applied to study changes in Earth's land and sea ice cover. We show that in 4 years CryoSat has been able to detect changes in the mass of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets with an accuracy comparable to that of the past 20 years of conventional satellite altimetry and that important changes have occured in these regions, we show that CryoSat has been able to quantify changes in the volume of sea ice across the entire northern hemisphere for the first time and that unexpected changes have occurred, and we show that the mission has been able to detect changes in the volume of rugged, glaciated terrain, that were beyond the capability of past altiemter missions and that are in places extreme in comparison to past observations.",

            "abstract": "The motivation for this project was simple: to reduce raw data from the Ultraviolet Spectrometers on both Voyager Spacecraft to verify the results of a simulation of Lyman-alpha radiative transfer within a 3D MHD kinetic-neutral model of the heliosphere created at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The heliospheric model, which self-consistently includes the interaction between ionized and neutral hydrogen, outputs a density map of neutral hydrogen. The Monte Carlo radiative transfer model then simulates the propagation and scattering of millions of photons through this density map and outputs the relative number of photons that should be seen by spacecraft at any point within 1000 AU of the sun. My project was to learn how to analyze the raw Voyager data and compare it to these simulations.\nThere were several stages of analysis necessary to reduce to useful data. Records containing signals from sources other than the interplanetary medium, such as stars and planets, were discarded. The remaining records were averaged along regional lines of sight to achieve better signal to noise. The spectra were then corrected for inherent device flaws, such as channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity (fixed-pattern noise), dark counts due to the radioisotope thermal electric generator, and imperfections in the scattering of the diffraction grating. Records were then sorted and averaged to create a full-sky map consisting of 18 regions for each specified radial bin to match the cell spacing of the radiative transfer model. The results were then normalized to solar minimum to reduce variations in the data due to solar cycle oscillations.\nInitial results indicate an unexpected deviation from the models, but more analysis must be performed to determine if the discrepancy comes from the normalization of the data, insufficient angular resolution of the radiative transfer model, or the physics of the models themselves. Future work involves increasing the resolution of the radiative transfer model and the number of sky regions to try to resolve smaller scale features of the heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "Shortly after the climactic eruption of ~600 km3 of Bishop Tuff zoned rhyolitic magma, ~100 km3 of crystal-poor Early Rhyolite erupted inside Long Valley Caldera between ~750-650 ka as domes, glassy lavas, and tuffs (Hildreth, 2004). Despite similarities in bulk composition (e.g., 73-75 wt% SiO2; ~100 ppm Sr), there are marked differences between the Late (≥ 790°C) Bishop Tuff and postcaldera Early Rhyolites. Although crystal-poor (<5%), the Early Rhyolites are often saturated with 7-8 mineral phases (plag + opx + ilm + tmte + biotite + apatite + zircon ± pyrrhotite), but without the quartz, sanidine, and cpx additionally found in the more crystal-rich (12-24%) Late Bishop Tuff. Pre-eruptive temperatures, on the basis of two Fe-Ti oxides, range from 720-860°C, and ∆NNO values range from-0.4 to -0.9 (consistent with abundant ilmenite). Thus the Early Rhyolites record fO2 values that are nearly two orders of magnitude lower than those in the Late Bishop Tuff (∆NNO = +1; Hildreth and Wilson, 2007). Application of the plagioclase-liquid hygrometer to Early Rhyolites gives pre-eruptive water contents ≤ 4.4 wt% H2O. The phenocrysts in Early Rhyolite obsidians often display euhedral and/or diffusion-limited growth textures, suggesting degassing-induced crystallization during rapid ascent. Isotopic data from the literature (e.g., Simon et al., 2014 and references therein) show that Long Valley rhyolites were derived from both crustal and mantle sources. We hypothesize that the drop in fO2 between the Late Bishop Tuff and Early Rhyolites may reflect a transition in their respective mantle source, from subduction-modified lithosphere to asthenosphere. Such a time-progressive transition in the mantle source of erupted basalts is seen throughout the Great Basin, occurring earliest in its central region and more recently toward its western margin (e.g. Cousens et al., 2012). Although the geochemistry of Quaternary basalts erupted around Long Valley indicate a subduction-modified lithosphere source (Cousens, 1996), the Early Rhyolites may be recording the crustal emplacement of basalts from the asthenosphere before any have yet erupted. If so, the Early Rhyolites may be derived from a greater proportion of crustal sources than calculated from isotopic data on the assumption of a lithospheric mantle source.",

Moreover, our results clearly show that all volcanos in this region have their roots — low velocity zones, among them the roots of Changbai, Jingbohu, Wudalianchi are obviously connected, while the biggest one of Daxinganling is separated.

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity of headwater catchments affects surface water yield and quality of downstream drinking water supplies. Lower Gordon Gulch, a 2.75 km2 catchment, is part of the Boulder Creek watershed – the primary drinking water supply for the city of Boulder, Colorado. We hypothesize that the geologic and climatic environment within the catchment controls the magnitude, timing, and duration of hydrologic connection between the landscape and the stream, and thus the distribution of major ions to the surface water. Specifically, bedrock patterns, vegetation type and density, and snowpack dynamics influence how precipitation inputs move from the hillslopes to the catchment outlet. Preliminary results suggest that north-facing hillslopes with steeper slopes, deeper weathering of bedrock, denser vegetation stands, and a seasonal snowpack, provide consistently greater groundwater inputs to the stream compared to the south-facing hillslopes. We believe that this is in part due to subsurface bedrock patterns forcing a dominate cross-valley gradient. Through an extensive observation network of hillslope wells, periodic stream water balance measurements, and synoptic chemistry samples, we plan to continue our assessment of the spatio-temporal connectivity dynamics throughout the seasonal dry down (late summer through winter), during which streamflow can be intermittent. Results will help to guide landuse practices of upland catchments with respect to their role in Boulder’s drinking water supply.",

            "abstract": "Most biogeochemical studies in forests have concentrated on nutrient pools and transformations occurring at relatively large spatial scales (i.e., stand or small catchment), over monthly or annual time scales. Many of these studies have also focused on the average or medial values observed across the spatial or temporal scale studied, discounting outliers. However, extremely high values found consistently (hot spot) or infrequently (hot moment) at a given soil microsite may be critical for nutrient acquisition by organisms and nutrient retention by terrestrial ecosystems. We have been evaluating soil nutrient hot-spot and hot-moment phenomena vertically (to a 60-cm depth) and horizontally (2-m sampling interval within a 6 m x 6 m grid) in two areas within a mixed-conifer, Sierran forest experiencing a Mediterranean-type climate. Nutrient fluxes in space and time were measured using ion exchange resin capsules placed at various depths and collected at two times (first significant precipitation in fall and post-snowmelt in spring) per year. Our previous work over a single year showed that fluxes of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in mineral soil were substantially greater in the spring (post-snowmelt) than in the fall, suggesting that soil water was a major factor in controlling these nutrient fluxes. The opposite pattern was found for NH4+ and Na+, where greater fluxes occurred following the first precipitation event in fall. Here, we report new data over two additional years at these same sites that allow us to better delineate between nutrient hot spots and hot moments. Overall, our results suggest that microbial-mediated nutrients (e.g., NH4+, NO3-, and PO43-) occur frequently as both hot spots and hot moments within soil, while those that are more abiotically controlled (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) occur predominately as hot spots. Further elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for nutrient hot spot-hot moment phenomena within soil should be invaluable for improving the predictive capacity of biogeochemical models and for scaling these models across space and time.",

To effectively simulate stormwater runoff processes at multiple scales, complex spatio-temporal parameters such as rainfall, evapotranspiration, and antecedent soil moisture conditions must be accurately represented, in addition to uniquely urban factors including stormwater conveyance structures and connectivity between green and gray infrastructure elements. In heavily urbanized San Juan, Puerto Rico, stream flashiness and frequent flooding are major issues, yet still lacking is a hydrological analysis that models the generation and movement of fluvial and pluvial stormwater through the watershed. Our research employs a novel and multifaceted approach to dealing with this problem that integrates 1) field-based rainfall interception and infiltration methodologies to quantify the hydrologic functions of natural and built infrastructure in San Juan; 2) remote sensing analysis to produce a fine-scale typology of green and gray cover types in the city and determine patterns of spatial distribution and connectivity; 3) assessment of precipitation and streamflow variability at local and basin-wide scales using satellite and radar precipitation estimates in concert with rainfall and stream gauge point data and participatory flood mapping; 4) simulation of historical, present-day, and future stormwater runoff scenarios with a fully distributed hydrologic model that couples diverse components of urban socio-hydrological systems from formal and informal knowledge sources; and 5) bias and uncertainty analysis of parameters and model structure within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Preliminary results from the rainfall interception study suggest that canopy structure and leaf area index of different tree species contribute to variable throughfall and stemflow responses. Additional investigations are pending. The findings from this work will help inform urban planning and design, and build adaptive capacity to reduce flood vulnerability in the context of a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "PolarCube and CloudIceCube (PC/CIC) are twin tandem 3U CubeSat satellites based on a common and existing bus design (ALL-STAR) and a common Earth-imaging passive microwave instrument payload architecture with suborbital aircraft flight heritage. These instrument payloads are being miniaturized for an orbital opportunity to provide atmospheric temperature profile measurements, cloud ice mass statistics, sea ice/ice-free ocean detection and mapping, and ice sheet surface snow properties that complement and extend existing passive microwave measurements from space. Collectively, these instruments, currently being prototyped, will comprise the first multi-frequency millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave (MMW/SMMW) passive microwave imaging sensors flown in space. The objective is to map the brightness temperature spectra of several critical cryospheric and tropospheric Earth systems at high spatial resolution (~18.5 km) and high radiometric precision (~0.3-2.0K) at three key bands (118.7503, 325.153-340, and 670 GHz) over the entire globe during a nominal one year mission beginning in 2016. We discuss the application of the integrated PC/CIC data sets to climatological cloud modeling, determination of the vertical temperature and water vapor structure of polar regions, polar climate and atmosphere change studies, sea ice mapping, and ice sheet snow accumulation. Importantly, global cloud ice mass and mean particle size mapping will be supported at ~2o spatial scale using a new and independent passive MMW/SMMW technique as a means to constrain general circulation model cloud statistics. The PC/CIC mission will provide an important snapshot of global cloud ice mass statistics in the current era years prior to operational passive microwave cloud ice measurement. It will also demonstrate the use of compact, multi-frequency, scanning microwave radiometers that are prototypes of a new low-cost class of spaceborne microwave weather and climate sensors.",

            "abstract": "Eclogite xenoliths from the Moses Rock diatreme, UT, USA are of controversial (Proterozoic or Phanerozoic) age. In this study, seven garnets from four Moses Rock eclogite xenoliths were analyzed for δ18O by ion microprobe. Garnet core δ18O values are 7.8-10.3‰ VSMOW. All samples have a sharp change between cores and rim values of 5.8-6.9‰. These garnets have the first reported oxygen isotope zoning from mantle xenoliths. The core values are well outside the range of garnets equilibrated with the mantle, suggesting that they began growth during subduction from an altered oceanic crustal protolith. Most rim values reach the mantle range. This decrease in δ18O from core to rim is consistent with continued subduction of the eclogites into the mantle. The failure of some garnet rims to reach mantle δ18O values may indicate that they did not equilibrate fully with the mantle, or were exposed to a mixed mantle-slab fluid.\nZoning in the samples from this study record a stepped shift from an altered upper oceanic crust protolith, to a mantle-influenced environment. The preservation of zoning in some of the samples from this study suggests that these eclogites were protected within the cool subducting slab and experienced a short mantle residence time. The preservation of cation and oxygen isotope zoning is more consistent with an origin during Franciscan subduction than Proterozoic subduction, unless the zoning is a late feature that formed just prior to volcanic emplacement. This is further supported by the similar patterns of increased pyrope content and decreasing δ18O found in some Franciscan eclogite garnets (e.g., Errico et al., 2013, CMP).",

            "abstract": "Human modification of the nitrogen (N) cycle has resulted in increased flows of reactive N, with some suggesting that planetary boundaries for maintaining human and ecosystem health have been exceeded. Persistence of large hypoxic zones in inland and coastal waters created by elevated concentrations of nitrate is one of the most significant impacts of such increased flows. While the need to manage these flows is recognized, best management practices to reduce stream N concentrations have had only limited success. Some have attributed this lack of success to accumulation of legacy N stores from decades of fertilizer application. Here we introduce an unprecedented analysis of long-term soil data from the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) revealing significant increases in total N (TN) content. We show that TN accumulation for the MRB accounts for 43% of net anthropogenic N inputs, complementing previous work indicating an approximately 25% loss of net inputs as riverine output. These findings significantly reduce uncertainty associated with basin-level N retention and demonstrate the presence of N accumulation in the deeper subsurface of agricultural soils. The presence of such legacy N stores is utilized in the development of a conceptual framework for quantifying catchment-scale time lags based on both soil nutrient accumulations (biogeochemical legacy) and groundwater travel time distributions (hydrologic legacy). Time scales of change for stream nutrient concentrations are explored as a function of both natural and anthropogenic controls, from topography to spatial patterns of land-use change, and an optimization approach has been developed to determine maximum possible concentration reduction benefits within time frames of interest.",

CYGNSS consists of a constellation of eight small observatories carried into orbit on a single launch vehicle. The eight satellites comprise a constellation that flies closely together to measure the ocean surface wind field with unprecedented temporal resolution and spatial coverage, under all precipitating conditions, and over the full dynamic range of wind speeds experienced in a TC.\nThe 8 CYGNSS observatories will fly in 500 km circular orbits at a common inclination of ~35°. Each observatory includes a Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) consisting of a modified GPS receiver capable of measuring surface scattering, a low gain zenith antenna for measurement of the direct GPS signal, and two high gain nadir antennas for measurement of the weaker scattered signal. Each DDMI is capable of measuring 4 simultaneous bi-static reflections, resulting in a total of 32 wind measurements per second across the globe by the full constellation.\nSimulation studies will be presented which examine the sampling as functions of various orbit parameters of the constellation. For comparison purposes, a similar analysis is conducted using the sampling of several past and present conventional spaceborne ocean wind scatterometers. Differences in the ability of the sensors to resolve the evolution of the TC inner core will be examined.\nThe CYGNSS observatories are currently in Phase C development. An update on the current status of the mission will be presented, including the expected precision, accuracy and spatial and temporal sampling properties of the retrieved winds.",

The social network analysis diagrams the NCA’s engagement with stakeholders around the country, showing how the network of stakeholders with whom the NCA engaged expanded over the course of the Third NCA. Showing the avenues for how information moves through a social system, social network analysis can be used to inform gaps in the types and locations of stakeholders engaged with, suggesting places to improve the flow of information.

It will also include suggestions for how to more effectively translate climate change information to stakeholders.

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of rhyolitic conduits and lava flows, requires precise knowledge of how viscosity (η) varies with temperature (T), pressure (P) and volatile content (X). In order to address the paucity of viscosity data for high-silica rhyolite at low water contents, which represent water saturation at near-surface conditions, we made 245 viscosity measurements on Mono Craters (California) rhyolites containing between 0.01 and 1.1 wt.% H2O, at temperatures between 796 and 1774 K using parallel plate and concentric cylinder methods at atmospheric pressure. We then developed and calibrated a new empirical model for the log of the viscosity of rhyolitic melts, where non-linear variations due to temperature and water content are nested within a linear dependence of log η on P. The model was fitted to a total of 563 data points: our 245 new data, 255 published data from rhyolites across a wide P-T-X space, and 63 data on haplogranitic and granitic melts under high P-T conditions. Statistically insignificant parameters were eliminated from the model in an effort to increase parsimony and the final model is simple enough for use in numerical models of conduit or lava flow dynamics:\nlog η = -5.142+(13080-2982log⁡(w+0.229))/(T-(98.9-175.9 log⁡(w+0.229)))- P(0.0007-0.76/T )\nwhere η is in Pa s, w is water content in wt.%, P is in MPa and T is in K. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the model predictions and the 563 data points used in calibration is 0.39 log units. Experimental constraints have led previously to spurious correlations between P, T, X and η in viscosity data sets, so that predictive models may struggle to correctly resolve the individual effects of P, T and X, and especially their cross-correlations. The increasing water solubility with depth inside a simple isothermal sheet of obsidian suggests that viscosity should decrease by ~1 order of magnitude at ~20m depth and by ~2 orders of magnitude at ~100m depth. If equilibrium water contents are maintained, then deformation in spreading obsidian flows should be strongly partitioned into the deeper parts of the flow. Kinetically inhibited degassing, or recycling of degassed crust into a flow interior (e.g. by caterpillar-tread motion) could lead to strong lateral variations in viscosity within a flow, affecting flow evolution and morphology.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic models (Xchaos) made from Champ and Orsted data are used to place constraints on the average magnetic susceptibility and its variability in the continental crust. Estimates of magnetic crustal thickness are made in a two-step process. The first step uses a recent seismic model (Crust1.0) to estimate the thickness of crystalline crust above the Moho, modified in the Andes and the Himalayas to account for the non-magnetic lower crust there. The second step calculates the magnetic field expected from such a layer of crystalline rock assuming the magnetization is solely induced in the earth’s main field by rock of constant magnetic susceptibility, and modifies the starting crustal thickness to bring it into agreement with the Xchaos model. This global model removes spherical harmonic degrees less than 15 to account for the core field mask. We restrict our attention to the continental crust, in particular to Australia, western North America, and Scandinavia. Petrophysical and petrological data from Scandinavian rocks that have been deep in the crust help place limits on susceptibility values. Our simulations use two susceptibilities, 0.02 and 0.04 SI. The mean crystalline crustal thickness from the seismic model is 42 and 37 km in western North America and Australia, respectively, and the modification with the magnetic data makes little change to the mean crustal thickness, irrespective of whether the susceptibility is 0.02 or 0.04 SI. However, the modification with the magnetic data does make a significant difference to the standard deviation of the crustal thickness, increasing it by a factor of two in the case of a susceptibility of 0.04, and by a factor of four in the case of a susceptibility of 0.02. The changes to the standard deviation of the crustal thickness are also evident in the Scandinavian data, but the mean crystalline crustal thickness of 45 km is significantly larger than that found from either magnetic model (33 and 30 km). The differences could be due to magnetic remanence oblique to the present field, or to weaker magnetizations in the crust. We use Swarm data from 10 April (Kp<0+) to place bounds on the minimum apparent magnetization required, irrespective of direction, to explain the observations, in an approach pioneered by Parker.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is undergoing rapid climatic changes, which are some of the most coordinated changes currently occurring anywhere on Earth. They are exemplified by the retreat of the perennial sea ice cover, which integrates forcing by, exchanges with and feedbacks between atmosphere, ocean and land. While historical reconstructions from Global Climate and Global Earth System Models (GC/ESMs) are in broad agreement with these changes, the rate of change in the GC/ESMs remains outpaced by observations. Reasons for that stem from a combination of coarse model resolution, inadequate parameterizations, unrepresented processes and a limited knowledge of physical and other real world interactions.\nWe demonstrate the capability of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) in addressing some of the GC/ESM limitations in simulating observed seasonal to decadal variability and trends in the sea ice cover and climate. RASM is a high resolution, fully coupled, pan-Arctic climate model that uses the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. It uses the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE) and Parallel Ocean Program (POP) configured at an eddy-permitting resolution of 1/12° as well as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models at 50 km resolution. All RASM components are coupled via the CESM flux coupler (CPL7) at 20-minute intervals.\nRASM is an example of limited-area, process-resolving, fully coupled earth system model, which due to the additional constraints from lateral boundary conditions and nudging within a regional model domain facilitates detailed comparisons with observational statistics that are not possible with GC/ESMs. In this talk, we will emphasize the utility of RASM to understand sensitivity to variable parameter space, importance of critical processes, coupled feedbacks and ultimately to reduce uncertainty in arctic climate change projections.",

            "abstract": "The combined use of Lidar and radar interferometry to estimate canopy height can be classified into 3 categories: cross-validation, simple combination and fusion methods. In this presentation, we investigate the potential of each category for local and regional scale applications, and assess their sensitivity to instrument configuration, terrain topography and variations in the vertical forest canopy profiles.\nIn addition to field data, we use data from TanDEM-X, UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar), LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) and a commercial discrete lidar. TanDEM-X is a pair of X-band spaceborne radars flying in formation to provide a global digital surface model and can also be used to perform polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (polinSAR) inversion of canopy height. The UAVSAR is an airborne fully polarimetric radar enabling repeat-pass interferometry and has been used for polinsar. While LVIS records the full waveform within a 20m footprint, the discrete lidar collects a cloud of points. The lidar data can be used to validate the polinSAR results (validation), to obtain ground elevation (simple combination with radar surface models) or within the polinSAR inversion model through a common model framework.\nThe data was collected over the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, a managed territory covering 7861km2 which is located between Québec city and Saguenay. The variety of management practices offers the possibility for long term and comparative studies of natural forest dynamics as well as the impact of human, fires and insect disturbances. The large elevational gradient of the region (~1000m) allows study of variations in structure and type of forests.\nDepending on the method used, several factors may degrade the accuracy of canopy height estimates from the combined use of lidar and radar interferometry. Here we will consider misregistration of datasets, differences in spatial resolution and viewing geometry, geometric decorrelation and the vertical wavenumber. Finally we investigate the sensitivity of estimate to forest vertical profile and terrain topography.",

            "abstract": "Zonal wind strength and direction are fundamental components of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and likely play an important role in global temperature modulation. However, historical observations of tropical Pacific winds are limited, and existing datasets disagree on long-term trends, emphasizing the need for independent data to assess zonal wind variability. Earlier work using a 17-year dataset from Tarawa Atoll suggests that Mn/Ca in corals near west-facing lagoons record westerly winds associated with the onset and maintenance of El Niño events. These westerly wind anomalies trigger strong physical mixing and release of Mn from the Mn-enriched lagoonal sediments, which is incorporated into the coral skeleton. Here we present a new ~90 year Mn/Ca record from Tarawa that allows us to assess westerly wind anomalies before the mid-20th century, when instrumental data from the tropical Pacific are scarce. We compare this new Mn/Ca record with 20th-century reanalysis zonal wind and demonstrate a strong association between the frequency of westerly winds and Tarawa Mn/Ca from 1890-1982. This new wind reconstruction also corroborates and extends the idea, developed from models and analyses of the well-observed late 20th century, that periods of strong Pacific trade winds are associated with cooler equatorial Pacific SSTs and a slower rate of global warming, and vice versa. By adding Mn/Ca to the suite of coral tracers measured for paleoclimate reconstructions from appropriate sites, we can expand our view of past climate variability to include westerly winds, along with the more commonly reconstructed variables of SST and salinity. Development of additional Mn/Ca records from other equatorial atolls with westerly facing lagoons will be used to obtain a broader multivariate perspective on the dynamics of recent climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Similarity scaling predicts that wind induced shear will be the dominant source of turbulence near the air-water interface in lakes with low to moderate wind forcing. Turbulence is expected to be enhanced with wave activity; results are conflicting on the effects of heating and cooling. We measured turbulence with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) and / or a temperature-gradient microstructure profiler and obtained correlative time series measurements of meteorology and water column temperature in a 800 m2 arctic pond, a 1 ha boreal lake, and a large tropical reservoir. Turbulence measurements with both instruments corroborated those calculated from similarity scaling in the boreal lake. Within the arctic pond, dissipation rates obtained with the ADV were in agreement with those from similarity scaling when winds exceeded ~1.5 m/s with a greater frequency of measurable dissipation rates when surface waves were present. Dissipation rates in the tropical reservoir reached and often exceeded 10‑6 m2 s-3 in the upper meter under light winds and decreased by an order of magnitude with cooling or rainfall. Under cooling, dissipation rates were at least an order of magnitude higher in the uppermost 25 cm bin than in the water column below. Gas transfer coefficients calculated from concurrent measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes with floating chambers and the surface renewal model using the estimates of turbulence were in agreement. These results support the predictions of Monin-Obuhov similarity scaling in that shear dominates turbulence production near the air-water interface under heating and cooling, illustrate spatial variability in turbulence production in small water bodies due to the intermittency of wind interacting with the water’s surface, are in agreement with prior oceanic observations that shear and associated turbulence can be intensified in shallow mixing layers under heating with light winds, and illustrate the utility of similarity scaling for predicting gas transfer coefficients.",

            "abstract": "The concentration of bubbles, crystals or droplets into small volumes of magma is a key trigger for many interesting magmatic processes. For example, gas slugs driving Strombolian eruptions form from the coalesence of exsolved bubbles within a volcanic conduit, while Ni-Cu-PGE magmatic sulfide deposits require a concentration of dense sulfide droplets from a large volume of magma to form a massive ore body. However the physical mechanism for this clustering remains unresolved - especially since small particles in active magma flows are expected to mostly track flow streamlines rather than clustering.\nWe have uncovered a previously unreported clustering mechanism which is applicable to magmatic flows. This mechanism involves the interaction of particles with two kinds of chaotic flow structure: (a) high-strain regions within the well-mixed chaotic zones of the flow, and (b) unmixed islands of stability within the chaotic flow, known as Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) regions. The first figure shows the difference between chaotic and KAM regions in a chaotic laminar pipe flow.\nTrapping occurs when particles are scattered from high-strain regions in the chaotic zones and become trapped in the KAM regions, leading to a rapid concentration of particles relative to their original distribution (shown in the second series of figures). Using a combination of these analogue experiments and theoretical analysis we outline the conditions under which this clustering process can occur. We examine the onset of secondary density-related instabilities and the effects of increased particle-particle interaction within the clustered particles, and highlight the impact of particle clustering on the dynamics of magma ascent and emplacement.",

A few existing sea surface temperature (SST) records from the Western Pacific warm pool and South China Sea, at a low resolution, suggest warmer SSTs during this epoch. However, the magnitude of the warmth, as compared to modern conditions, as well as the temperature fluctuations within this period, remains largely elusive. In this study, we reconstruct biomarker-based high-resolution SST records during the late Miocene-Pliocene period from a sediment core retrieved from the Qiongzhou Strait, northern South China Sea. The records reveal the details of the SST variability over this period. Within the late Miocene-Pliocene, a few notable relatively cooling periods at 4.3 Ma, 5.5 Ma, could be identified, which appear to correspond to global benthic d18O changes. Overall, our results suggest that SSTs was indeed warmer than today and that the SST fluctuations within this period was probably modulated by orbital changes.",

Only a modest part of the global land surface is now free of human effects, much of which have been for agriculture and pasture, and to a lesser extent human habitation in urban areas. These land surface changes have in turn affected the land surface water cycle, mostly via enhanced evapotranspiration from that portion of the agricultural area that is irrigated, and from storage of river runoff in reservoirs that provide most of the irrigation water. I evaluate the signature of these perturbations on the land surface water balance on a continent by continent basis, and for selected major river basins. I further evaluate the effect of anthropogenic perturbations in terms of their interseasonal and interannual magnitudes of variation relative to other terms in the land surface water cycle, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and storage change associated with snow and soil moisture. I also evaluate the anthropogenic changes to date relative to projected changes over the next century associated with a warming climate as inferred from IPCC AR5 model output for selected large river basins.",

While access to these data sources is beneficial, growers can realize large gains by leveraging field level data and integrating decision support tools that have been presented in the literature. Using a previously developed model for estimating the growth stage of maize (Sakamoto et al. 2010), we examine how remotely sensed data can be integrated into a web-based agricultural management tool, informing grower management decisions by providing near real-time estimates of crop growth stage and sub-field level variability in growing conditions. When combined with field-level soil and weather data, growers can use remote sensing based models to tailor management activities, taking variable (climate related) and invariant (site characteristic) yield determining factors into account.\nTime series of Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) derived from Landsat observations were linked to 97 fields growing maize across the Mid-western region of the United States in 2013. Crop growth stage day of year (DOY) estimates (V2.5, R1, R5, and R6) were predicted for each field based on the WDRVI profile and compared to a growing degree day based estimate. These estimates aid in scheduling growth stage specific management activities and allow farmers to more efficiently monitor geographically remote fields. Within-field variation in growing conditions is presented on an ordinal scale (below average, average, above average) based on the field-level distribution of WDRVI values at each observation. Monitoring of sub-field level conditions allows growers to calibrate field-level yield estimates, prioritize field scouting activities and plan targeted interventions. Integration of these tools into existing web-based agricultural management tools allows growers to easily incorporate remotely sensed data into their decision making process, facilitating the exchange of information between researchers and practitioners.",

This seismic station will explore the Martian ambient noise, in addition to more classical science goals related to the detection of Marsquakes, Meteoritic Impacts and Tides.\nMars, in contrast with the Earth (with both atmosphere and ocean) and the Moon (with no atmosphere nor ocean) is expected to have ambient noise only related to its atmosphere. Mars seismic data are therefore expecting to reveal the atmospheric coupling for a different atmospheric dynamics than Earth, especially in the 0.1-1 Hz bandwidth, dominated by oceanic microseisms on Earth.\nWe rapidly present the expected performances of the SEIS experiment onboard InSight. This experiment is based on two 3 axis seismometers, one covering the tide and low seismic frequencies (up to 10 Hz) and a second one covering the high frequencies (from 0.1 Hz to 50 Hz). Both sensors are mounted on a sensors plateform, deployed by a robotic arm 1-2 meters from the lander and covered by thermal protection and a wind protection. The expected performances indicates that signal as low as 10**(-9) m/s**2/Hz**(1/2) will be detected in the 0.005-2 Hz bandwidth.\nWe then focus on the modeling of this ambient atmospheric noise.This modeling has been done not only from constraints gathered by the atmospheric sensors of previous Mars missions (e.g. Viking and Pathfinder) but also by numerical modeling of the atmospheric perturbations, both at global scale and mesoscale. Theoretical estimation of the ambient noise has then been obtained for the pressure-correlated surface loading and the stochastic excitation of surface waves, at both long and very long period (e.g. Mars hum) and at medium or short period (e.g. regional and local generated surface waves). Results shows that most of these source of ambient noise will be detected, likely during the day for those generated locally and possibly during the night for those of global origin.",

            "abstract": "A major problem in earth surface process and hazards research is we have little to no knowledge of precisely where and when the next significant event may occur. This makes it nearly impossible to set up adequate instrumentation and observation ahead of time. Furthermore, it is not practical to overcome this challenge by instrumenting and observing everywhere all the time. We can’t be everywhere and see everything. Remote sensing helps us to fill that gap with missions such as Landsat and WorldView2 offering regular global coverage. However, remote sensing systems for global monitoring have several inherent compromises. Tradeoffs must be made between data storage, processing capacity, spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and temporal resolution. Additionally, instruments and systems must be designed in advance and from a generalized standpoint to serve as many purposes as possible, often at the expense of high performance in specific tasks.\nBecause of these practical constraints, when using remote sensing data to study earth surface processes it is critical to maximize signal content or information obtained from all available data. Several approaches, including multi-temporal data fusion, multi-sensor data fusion, and fusion with derivative products such as band ratios or vegetation indices can help expand how much information can be extracted from remote sensing acquisitions. Fused dataset results contain more coherent information than the sum of their individual constituents. Examples using Landsat and WorldView2 data in this study show this added information makes it possible to map earth surface processes and events, such as the 2011 Cinque Terre landslides, in a more automated and repeatable fashion over larger areas than is possible with manual imagery analysis techniques and with greater chance of successful detection.",

Conversely, recent historical records of 140 years revealed that the relationship between Indian Monsoon and ENSO has broken down (Kumar et al., 1999). Indian Monsoon rainfall variability on decadal time scale was reconstructed by using seawater oxygen isotopes (d18Ow) estimated from oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios of Globigerinoides ruber from a sediment core in the Bay of Bengal. A comparison of Indian Monsoon rainfall variability on decadal time scale with the number of ENSO events over last 2000 years reveals an inverse relationship between the monsoon rainfall in the Indian Subcontinent and ENSO Events. Furthermore, d18Ow variations reveal increased monsoon rainfall during Roman Warm Period (RWP) and Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and larger monsoon rainfall fluctuations during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Therefore, our study suggests that on decadal time scale ENSO affects the Indian Monsoon Rainfall through the stronger Walker Circulation and associated tropical convection process.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic flux ropes have been observed even in unmagnetized planets' ionosphere, such as Venus and Mars. In the case of Mars, the origin of Martian flux ropes is owing to not only the interplanetary magnetic field and associated draped magnetic fields, but also crustal magnetic fields. Planetary ions are energized through the direct interaction of the solar wind with the upper atmosphere, resulting in ion escape into interplanetary space. Hence magnetic flux ropes can contribute to the ion escape rates, because they may confine large amounts of ionospheric plasma.\nHere, we investigated formation processes of Martian magnetic flux ropes observed downstream from strong crustal magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere based on the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction (GSR) technique. The GSR technique can provide a two-dimensional axial magnetic field map as well as flux ropes axial orientation from single spacecraft data under assumptions that the structure is magneto-hydrostatic and time-independent. We reconstructed the 297 magnetic flux ropes from Mars Global Surveyor measurements between April 1999 and November 2006.\nBased on characteristics of their geometrical axial orientation and transverse magnetic field topology, we found that they can be mainly distinguished according to whether draped interplanetary magnetic fields overlaying on the crustal magnetic fields are involved or not. For approximately two-thirds of the events, they can be formed by magnetic reconnection between neighboring crustal magnetic fields attached to the surface. For the remaining events, however, magnetic reconnection between the crustal and overlaid draping magnetic fields seems to be necessary. Since the overlaid draping magnetic field connects to interplanetary space, planetary ions included inside those flux ropes can be easy to escape from Mars. We also quantitatively evaluate lower limits on potential ion escape rates from Mars owing to the magnetic flux ropes based on the GSR results, and discuss the contribution of magnetic flux ropes to the ion escape rate from Mars.",

            "abstract": "In the past, cost benefit analysis (CBA) has been viewed as an effective means of evaluating water utility strategies, particularly those that were dependent on the construction of new supply infrastructure. As water utilities have begun to embrace ‘soft-path’ approaches as a way to reduce the need for supply-centric development, CBA fails to recognize some important financial incentives affected by reduced water consumption. Demand management, both as a short-term response to drought and in longer-term actions to accommodate demand growth, can introduce revenue risks that adversely affect a utility’s ability to repay debt, re-invest in aging infrastructure, or maintain reserve funds for use in a short-term emergency. A utility that does not generate sufficient revenue to support these functions may be subject to credit rating downgrades, which in turn affect the interest rate it pays on its debt. Interest rates are a critical consideration for utility managers in the capital-intensive water sector, where debt payments for infrastructure often account for a large portion of a utility’s overall costs. Even a small increase in interest rates can add millions of dollars to the cost of new infrastructure. Recent studies have demonstrated that demand management techniques can lead to significant revenue variability, and credit rating agencies have begun to take notice of drought response plans when evaluating water utility credit ratings, providing utilities with a disincentive to fully embrace soft-path approaches. This analysis examines the impact of demand management schemes on key credit rating metrics for a water utility in Raleigh, North Carolina. The utility’s consumer base is currently experiencing rapid population growth, and demand management has the potential to reduce the dependence on costly new supply infrastructure but could lead to financial instability that will significantly increase the costs of financing future projects. This work analyzes how ‘soft-path’ approaches might be more efficiently integrated with investment in supply-side infrastructure and suggests how financial hedging tools could be used to improve long-term utility planning objectives.",

            "abstract": "The California mussel, Mytilus californianus, is an ecologically important species in the rocky intertidal ecosystems of the U.S. Pacific coast. During low tides, times of emersion, Mytilus californianus is exposed to aerial conditions and its body temperature can vary drastically depending on the amount of solar radiation they experience. Thermal stress from high temperatures during emersion sometimes can lead to mortality of individuals. Conversely, during high tides, times of submersion, body temperatures depend on the temperature of the water that surrounds them.\nThis study used remotely sensed surface temperature observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua and Terra to predict the body temperatures of Mytilus californianus. Mussel body temperatures were provided by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and de-tided. This technique divided the mussel body temperatures into times of emersion and times of submersion. During times of emersion, mussel body temperatures were compared to remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LST) and in-situ air temperatures. During times of submersion, mussel body temperatures were compared to remotely sensed sea surface temperatures (SST) and in-situ water temperatures. To identify spatial variation in temperatures, eight different study sites ranging in latitude along the coast of Oregon were analyzed. Additionally, to better understand the temporal variation in temperatures, fourteen years (2000-2013) were analyzed for each study site.\nSea surface temperature collected during the Aqua overpass and Terra overpass were strongly correlated with mussel body temperatures but varied by study site. Our results show that remotely sensed temperature could predict average daily mussel temperature within 1°C on average during times of submersion.\nBeing able to use remotely sensed surface temperatures to predict the body temperatures of intertidal mussel species will enhance our ability to predict the effects of climate change on intertidal ecosystems. Additionally, it will lead to more research that investigates using remotely sensed observations to understand dynamics in other ecosystems beside the rocky intertidal.",

            "abstract": "Large, deep-seated landslides always have the potential to reactivate in the future – generally locally and not the whole slide. How does one determine if one of these large landslides has reactivated if there are houses on it? In April of 2014 a 25 year old house was investigated to see if it was creeping on an ancient landslide near Kelso, Washington. In 1998 we had worked on nearby prehistoric slides to determine if they had reactivated. We developed a list of 17 points to investigate on a lot and in a house that showed that stress was causing movement. Inside the house we checked for: propagation of cracks in the walls, nails popping out of the walls, bulging walls, separation of internal and external chimney from walls, creaking and popping noises in the house, light switches coming out of the walls, doors and windows that are hard to shut, twisted ceiling and floor beams, cracks in concrete floors, and water seeping into the basement. On the lot outside we looked for changes in surface water drainage, bulges in retaining walls, scarps developing in the soils, pistol butt trees, and broken sewage and water lines. A stable site is defined as a site having none of the above characteristics. Slight movement is defined as having 1-5 of the above characteristics. Moderate movement is from 6 to 10 and considerable movement is from 11+. The house we investigated had a score of 14 – definitely was moving! It had had two electrical fires in the past year from severed electrical wires. We recommend that areas of slight movement be monitored, and lots with moderate to considerable movement to be dewatered to slow the movement. If engineering geologists know that movement has started early enough, proper mitigation can be installed that might stop the movement and save the homes.",

            "abstract": "Of interest here are single-tread alluvial channels (or mildly anastomosing reaches with a single dominant channel) which are self-formed within their own floodplain. The 232 reaches considered here cover nearly the entire range of such channels, with bankfull discharge varying from 3.3x10-1 m3/s to 2.6x105 m3/s, characteristic bed material size varying from 0.04 mm to 168 mm, bed slopes varying from 8x7x10-6 to 5.2x10-2 and bankfull depths varying from 2.2x10-1 m to 4.8x101 m. These channels show complexity at every scale, including the organization of bed grains, the existence or absence of bedforms such as dunes and bars, the state of eroding banks (e.g. fallen trees, rooted stumps, or slump blocks) and the species and density of floodplain vegetation. Scientific research can often be broadly classified into two types: a) research that shows that a system formerly thought to be relatively simple is instead much more complex, with an increase in the number of factors which must be considered to obtain understanding; and b) research which extracts general, broad-brush simplicity from complexity. Both approaches can contribute to the advancement of science. Here we consider the second approach. The problem in question pertains to an explanation of an observation from the time of Luna Leopold: the single bankfull parameter that appears to be invariant is bankfull flow velocity. Here we demonstrate this result empirically at first-order, obtaining the estimate of 1.5 m/s across scales. We then derive a single, universal dimensionless number that specifies bankfull velocity, again across scales. The result is independent of bed material grain size, suggesting that previously-ignored wash load plays a major, and perhaps the dominant role as floodplain material load in setting bankfull velocity.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological models that represent flow and transport in subsurface domains are usually large-scale with excessive computational complexity and uncertain characteristics. Uncertainty quantification for predicting flow and transport in heterogeneous formations often entails utilizing a numerical Monte Carlo framework, which repeatedly simulates the model according to a random field representing hydrogeological characteristics of the field. The physical resolution (e.g. grid resolution associated with the physical space) for the simulation is customarily chosen based on recommendations in the literature, independent of the number of Monte Carlo realizations. This practice may lead to either excessive computational burden or inaccurate solutions. We propose an optimization-based methodology that considers the trade-off between the following conflicting objectives: time associated with computational costs, statistical convergence of the model predictions and physical errors corresponding to numerical grid resolution.\nIn this research, we optimally allocate computational resources by developing a modeling framework for the overall error based on a joint statistical and numerical analysis and optimizing the error model subject to a given computational constraint. The derived expression for the overall error explicitly takes into account the joint dependence between the discretization error of the physical space and the statistical error associated with Monte Carlo realizations. The accuracy of the proposed framework is verified in this study by applying it to several computationally extensive examples. Having this framework at hand aims hydrogeologists to achieve the optimum physical and statistical resolutions to minimize the error with a given computational budget. Moreover, the influence of the available computational resources and the geometric properties of the contaminant source zone on the optimum resolutions are investigated. We conclude that the computational cost associated with optimal allocation can be substantially reduced compared with prevalent recommendations in the literature.",

The project has now produced up to twenty-two years of consistent, calibrated and validated ESDR products for over 3200 GPS stations from Western North America, other plate boundaries, and global networks made available through the GPS Explorer data portal and NASA’s CDDIS archive. The combined solution of daily coordinate time series uses SOPAC h-files and JPL STACOV files as input to the st_filter software. The combined time series are then fit with the analyze_tseri software for daily positions/displacements, secular velocities, coseismic and postseismic displacements, as well as annual and semi-annual signatures and non-coseismic offsets due primarily to equipment (antenna) changes. Published uncertainties for the estimated parameters take into account temporal noise in the daily coordinate time series. The resulting residual coordinate time series with typical daily RMS values of 1.5-4.0 mm in the horizontal and 4.0-8.0 mm in the vertical can then can be mined for other signals such as transient deformation associated with earthquake tremor and slip (ETS) and hydrological effects. As part of this process we have catalogued and characterized coseismic displacements due to more than 80 earthquakes affecting over hundreds of regional and global stations, as well as significant postseismic deformation for the larger events. The larger events can affect stations 1000’s of km from the earthquake epicenters and thus significantly affect the positions of stations used in defining the reference frame.

The model, which considers a particle moving through a lattice, has provided the basis for the study of asymptotic forms that include one kind of nonlocality associated with heavy-tailed PDF for particle step length and waiting time. In the case of pebbles moving as bed material load (and thus interacting with the bed), however, the lattice itself varies according to the entrainment and deposition of pebbles, so that CTRW does not formally apply. Here we outline the development of an Exner-based Master Equation for the dispersal of bedload particles. The Master Equation has no active layer, and describes both streamwise and vertical advection-dispersion. Of particular importance is the treatment of waiting time. The formulation is based on the evolution of age structure in population dynamics. As a particle is deposited and buried at some elevation, its age is set to zero; it continues to age in place until the bed erodes down to that level and re-entrains the particle.",

The incomplete zeroing of luminescence signals (partial bleaching) in fluvial environments is an obstacle for dating, but proves advantageous for extracting information about grain-transport histories. Luminescence signals from quartz and feldspar sand have been observed to decrease as an exponential or stretched exponential function of distance downriver. A theoretical framework for the reduction in signal of quartz grains in ephemeral rivers has recently been proposed. We present improvements to a simple forward model for reduction in signal observed for small-aliquot multiple elevated temperature post-IR infrared stimulated luminescence (MET-pIRIR) of K-feldspar grains on the Mojave River in Southern California. Specifically, we use USGS historical stream gage records to produce synthetic hydrographs using time-series analysis. The synthetic hydrographs are used as inputs for an iterative model of signal growth (burial period between floods) and signal depletion (light exposure period during floods). From a best fit of this model to small-aliquot MET-pIRIR data, we can estimate virtual velocity of fine-grain (175 – 200 µm) sand from source to sink. Additionally, we present single-grain MET-pIRIR measurements of K-feldspar grains from the Mojave River and the Santa Clara River in Southern California and explore applications of single-grain data to provenance studies.",

            "abstract": "Supercontinent break-up has most commonly been linked to plume or superplume events, and/or supercontinent thermal insulation, but precise mechanisms are yet to be worked out. Even less know is if and what roles other factors may play. Key factors likely include gravitational force due to the continental superswell driven by both the lower-mantle superplume and continental thermal insulation, mental convention driven by the superplume and individual plumes atop the superplume, assisted by thermal/magmatic weakening of the supercontinent interior (both plume heat and thermal insulation heat). In addition, circum-supercontinent slab downwelling may not only drive the formation of the antipodal superplumes (thus the break-up of the supercontinent), the likely roll-back of the subduction system would also create extension within the supercontinent, facilitating supercontinent break-up.\nConsequences of supercontinent break-up include long-term sea-level rise, climatic changes due to changes in ocean circulation pattern and carbon cycle, and biodiversification. It has long been demonstrated that the existence of the supercontinent Pangea corresponds to a long-term sea-level drop, whereas the break-up of the supercontinent corresponds to a long-term sea-level rise (170 m higher than it is today). A recent analysis of Neoproterozoic sedimentary facies illustrates that the time of Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia corresponds to a low in the percentage of deep marine facies occurrence, whereas the time of Rodinia break-up corresponds to a significantly higher percentage of deep marine facies occurrence. The long-tern sea-level drop during supercontinent times were likely caused by both plume/superplume dynamic topography and an older mean age of the oceanic crust, whereas long-tern sea-level rise during supercontinent break-up (720–580 Ma for Rodinia and Late Jurassic–Cretaceous for Pangea) likely corresponds to an younger mean age of the oceanic crust, massive plume-induced magmatism in the oceans, and perhaps the effect of continents drifting away from a weakening sub-supercontinent superplume.",

This is but only one of the many available spectra that artists and scientists alike can use to capture and analyze how the world works. Each artist’s creative voice comes from individual experiences and their philosophy on how to portray the world around us. Adding infrared technology to the artist’s toolkit creates a new opportunity to glimpse into our world through a different set of lenses. By using both the subjective artist’s-eye and the critical scientist’s mind, we gain unique yet complementary viewpoints when we observe the same physical processes. Using digital SLR and thermal imaging cameras, we will capture still imagery and high-definition videos, at multiple frames per second. We will present examples, such as heat loss in cold environments over time, analyses of different rock structures, and the significance of emissivity on infrared measurements. We will show how these two spectra, the visible and infrared, together provide a novel outreach tool to visualize artistic and scientific principles.

            "abstract": "Over three days in late June 2013, 250 mm of precipitation fell on the partially snow-covered and heavily instrumented Marmot Creek Research Basin, Canadian Rockies, causing the largest recorded flood in the region, the destruction of most gauging stations in the research basin and the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history. Precipitation was remarkable in that similar depths fell at all elevations from forest-grassland valley bottom to mid-elevation montane forest to alpine ridge-top and started with relatively warm conditions even at high elevations (6 oC), turning to snowfall at the highest elevations towards the end of the event. Snowfall in the alpine zone of the basin is highly redistributed by wind and forms deep drifts on lee slopes and in tree-line forests. These snowdrifts persist into summer and form a critical water supply for the creek. Snow surveys six days before and one day after the event show alpine snowdrift water equivalent declining from 350 to 150 mm and snow-covered area declining from 97% to 55% The snowpack ablation of 120 mm during the heavy precipitation period enhanced water delivery to alpine surfaces from rainfall by 50%. The event was simulated using the modular, physically-based Cold Regions Hydrological Model which was set up here to include a blowing snow model and infiltration to frozen soil model coupled to the SNOBAL energy balance snowmelt model. The results show substantially slower snowmelt rates during the rain-on-snow (ROS) event than before or after the ROS. ROS was characterized by greatly reduced solar irradiance, which was not compensated for by increased net longwave radiation, advected heat from rainfall and small but consistently downward fluxes of sensible and latent heat. Turbulent fluxes did not drive melt as has been suggested for more temperate ROS melts and energy sources can be ranked as K*>L*>Qa>Qh>Qe>>Qg. Nevertheless the combination of rainfall, snowmelt and frozen soils caused alpine snowdrifts to be a ‘hot spot’ for runoff generation during the flood. The distinctive character of this ROS event occurring near summer solstice and with relatively cool atmospheric conditions meant that melt rates were not enhanced by ROS, but snowmelt during ROS was an important contributor to alpine streamflow.",

            "abstract": "In many methods of the present Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems, hypocenter and magnitude are determined quickly and then strengths of ground motions are predicted. The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (MW9.0), however, revealed some technical issues with the conventional methods: under-prediction due to the large extent of the fault rupture, and over-prediction due to confusion of the system by multiple aftershocks occurred simultaneously. To address these issues, a new concept is proposed for EEW: applying data assimilation technique, present wavefield is estimated precisely in real time (real-time shake mapping) and then future wavefield is predicted time-evolutionally using physical process of seismic wave propagation. Information of hypocenter location and magnitude are not required, which is basically different from the conventional method.\nIn the proposed method, data assimilation technique is applied to estimate the current spatial distribution of wavefield, in which not only actual observation but also anticipated wavefield predicted from one time-step before are used. Real-time application of the data assimilation technique enables us to estimate wavefield in real time, which corresponds to real-time shake mapping. Once present situation is estimated precisely, we go forward to the prediction of future situation using simulation of wave propagation.\nThe proposed method is applied to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (MW9.0) and the 2004 Mid-Niigata earthquake (Mw6.7). Future wavefield is precisely predicted, and the prediction is improved with shortening the lead time: for example, the error of 10 s prediction is smaller than that of 20 s, and that of 5 s is much smaller. By introducing this method, it becomes possible to predict ground motion precisely even for cases of the large extent of fault rupture and the multiple simultaneous earthquakes.\nThe proposed method is based on a simulation of physical process from the precisely estimated present condition. This method, therefore, corresponds to “numerical shake prediction”, on the analogy to “numerical weather prediction” in meteorology.",

            "abstract": "The post-Mesozoic tectonic history of the western Pacific margin is critical in understanding the major global tectonic events that occurred in the Eocene, such as the westward change in Pacific Plate motion and the simultaneous subduction initiation of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) Arc (Ishizuka et al., 2011 EPSL).\nThe present location of the Philippine Islands continuously serves as a major tectonic boundary between the southeastern Eurasian and the Pacific Plates, accommodating the large left-lateral movement associated with the clockwise rotation of the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) from Eocene to Miocene and now the subduction of the PSP from the east at the Philippine Trench - East Luzon Trough.\nThe basement rocks of the Philippine Islands are characterized by the presence of ophiolitic complexes exposed among the islands. Yumul (2007, Island Arc) defined four belts in the Philippine ophiolites and proposed that they progressively become younger towards west, from Early – Late Cretaceous at the easternmost belt to Eocene - Oligocene in the west. However, most of the ophiolitic complexes have been dated by radiolarians and foraminifera in the overlying sediments.\nTo precisely determine the igneous ages of the Philippine ophiolites, we have conducted SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating of the gabbroic and leucocratic rocks collected from the ophiolitic complexes in the Philippine Islands, including those from Luzon (Zambales and Isabela ophiolites), Masbate (Balud ophiolite), Tablas (Sibuyan Ophiolite), and Cebu. New zircon ages show that all of the ages obtained so far from the eastern ophiolite belts are Eocene in age, from 52 Ma to 41 Ma. These ages coincide well with the opening of the West Philippine Basin (49 – 33 Ma, Taylor and Goodliffe, 2004 JGR), which is a backarc basin formed behind the incipient IBM Arc. Furthermore, geochemical data available from the igneous rocks in the eastern ophiolite belts show backarc basin basalt-like geochemical affinities (e.g. Yumul, 2007), suggesting that these ophiolites are genetically associated with the West Philippine Basin. On the contrary, gabbroic and leucocratic rocks that are associated with the ophiolitic complex in Cebu are Late Cretaceous (~90 Ma) in age, significantly older than those in the eastern ophiolite belts, suggesting a different origin.",

            "abstract": "Within the critical zone on montane hillslopes of Colorado’s Front Range, qualitative observations suggest that gophers not only dominate the modern meadow geomorphic rates, but are involved in a geomorphic-ecological feedback system that governs meadow migration on decadal-millennial time scales. Our observations suggest that gopher intensity and location is pertinent to forest/meadow (FM) dynamics. Field mapping of gopher activity as the snow melts in the spring revealed that subnivean tubes (“eskers”) are tightly clustered at the FM boundary while mounds generated over the remainder of the summer are concentrated strictly in the meadows. This suggests that gophers spend the winter months at the FM interface and spend the warmer seasons within the meadows. We hypothesize that variations in snow depth drive this spatial-temporal pattern of gopher activity; deeper snow near the FM boundary provides greater insulation, as near-surface ground temperatures in the wind-scoured meadow centers are colder. This motivates our initiation of monitoring and modeling of near-surface temperature across a FM pair. Numerical modeling supports qualitative observations that the following geomorphic-ecological processes are active: seedling establishment and damage, gopher tunneling and resulting mound generation, mound material transport driven by ungulate trampling, vegetative lock-down of mound material, and resulting changes in the soil depth of the landscape. This year’s observations suggest that we must add to this mix the annual cycle of the gopher activity. Finally, probing and soil pits within the meadows reveal that on longer timescales gopher activity leads to the development of a well-mixed upper soil layer that is sharply bounded below by high concentrations of large stones (“stone lines”) within the glacial till substrate of the hillslopes. The mean diameter of mound surface grains is half that of clasts comprising the stone lines. This motivates documentation of soil mixing rates utilizing the short-lived bomb isotope 137Cs, which in turn will further constrain numerical modeling of the gopher-geomorphic system.",

Results based on the interpretation of the deep seismic data include the deep complicated geometry of the Tan-Lu fault and Zhangbaling uplift, appears as a subvertical thrust fault with its deep portion dip toward the southeast, and along which the Zhangbaling uplift is squeezed out; complex upper crust deformation structure beneath Chuquan depression, within which there are both kink bands, thrusts, imbrication and fold structures reflecting contraction deformation, and detachment fault and normal-fault structures reflecting extensional deformation; the “crocodile” reflection structure emerging beneath the Tan-Lu fault and Ningwu–Lishui volcanic basin, i.e., the upper crust reflection thrust upward, and the lower crust reflection thrust downward and offsetting the Moho discontinuity, which reflects the decoupled deformation process of the upper and lower crust, and is interpreted as an intracontinental subduction. Further to the southeast, the upper crust deformation shows a large-scale “wave-form” pattern, making crustal scale syncline and anticline. The entire section of the reflection Moho is clearly discernible at depth of 30.0–34.5 km, and the Moho beneath the YRMB is shallowest, while the Moho beneath the North China block is deeper than that beneath the Yangtze block. Moho offsets could be seen beneath the Ningwu volcanic basin.\nOverall, the seismic data show evidence for an intracontinental orogeny and imposes constraints on the deep geodynamic model applied to study region. Our interpretation of seismic profile supports the view that the Yanshanian orogeny, due to the northwest subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during the Middle–Late Jurassic, is the major event that shaped the tectonic framework of the region. A geodynamic model is proposed for the formation of the world-class metallogenic belt, this model includes several key deep processes, e.g., the subduction of intracontinental sublithosphere, the thickening and delamination of crustal roots, the melting of delaminated lower crust and underplating of the melts to the crust-mantle boundary and subsequent MASH processes.",

Because of this waxing interest in an integrative approach to the sciences, there is a broader push for school districts to offer classes geared towards the earth sciences, a field that incorporates knowledge and skills gleaned from the three core science subjects. Within the contexts of a regular secondary school day on a traditional schedule (45- to 50-minute long classes), it is challenging to engage students in rigorous field-based learning, critical for students to develop a deeper understanding of geosciences content, without requiring extra time outside of the regular schedule. We suggest instruction using common, manmade features like drainage retention ponds to model good field practices and provide students with the opportunity to calculate basic hydrologic budgets, take pH readings, and, if in an area with seasonal rainfall, make observations regarding soils by way of trenching, and near-surface processes, including mass wasting and the effects of vegetation on geomorphology. Gains in student understanding are discussed by analyzing the difference in test scores between exams provided to the students after they had received only in-class instruction, and after they had received field instruction in addition to the in-class lectures. In an advanced setting, students made measurements regarding ion contents and pollution that allowed the classes to practice lab skills while developing a data set that was analyzed after field work was completed. It is posited that similar fieldwork could be an effective approach at an introductory level in post-secondary institutions.",

            "abstract": "Within the stable continental region of Australia, the Flinders Ranges stands out as experiencing concentrated and prolonged seismic activity. Previous studies have shown that strain rates inferred from seismicity of 10-16 —10-15 s-1 are similar to neotectonic slip rates inferred for range-bounding faults. It is also an area of relatively pronounced topography up to 1700 m and high heat flow averaging 90 mW/m2. For these reasons the Flinders Ranges have been the subject of many studies trying to understand why deformation of the Australian continent appears to be localized there, with explanations including erosion-driven isostatic rebound, lithospheric flexure, stress concentration due to change in lithospheric strength, and thermal weakening. We present a hypothesis for localized, intraplate deformation in the continental crust of south-central Australia that involves fluid-assisted reactivation of faults in the mid- to lower crust. This study utilizes data from a temporary seismometer deployment in the Flinders Ranges from 2003—2005. We show that earthquakes in the region extend to depths of 20 km and are clustered in elongated low Vp/Vs anomalies. These anomalies suggest a highly fractured or deformed zone that is aligned with the axis of the Flinders Ranges and extends to the lower crust. We argue that the compressive earthquake focal mechanisms are consistent with the regional stress field, that there is no evidence for stress concentration, and that the occurrence of earthquakes at mid- to lower crustal depth in an area of high heat flow can only be explained by high pore fluid pressure in the lower crust. These data reveal important constraints on structure, rheology, and stress that are crucial for understanding intraplate deformation in the Flinders Ranges, with possible implications for high-seismicity zones in stable continental regions elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Gallium has a rare water-ice type P-V-T phase diagram in which the density of Ga melt exceeds by about 3 % that of the stable solid Ga phase I at ambient pressure. Liquid gallium, which is easily supercooled, can remain in a metastable liquid state for several months at ambient pressure. A rich polymorphism and metastable modifications of Ga have been discovered in P-T domain. There are a number of studies of liquid gallium under high pressure conditions, but some fundamental properties, such as the equation of state (EoS) of liquid Ga under extreme conditions remain unclear. Very recently, the advanced pair distribution function (PDF) method in which synchrotron high-energy x-ray total scattering data, combined with reverse Monte Carlo simulation, was used to study the microstructure and EoS of liquid gallium under high pressure conditions. However, the application of PDF method for amorphous or liquid samples under pressure conditions normally required a priori knowledge of their EoS. The density estimation from the reverse Monte Carlo simulation with the best mathematical fit to the measured structure factor data could cause big errors if it is calculated without knowing the EoS. In the paper, the volume change of liquid and solid gallium have been studied as a function of pressure and temperature up to 3.63 GPa using synchrotron x-ray microtomography combined with energy dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXRD) techniques. Two sets of directly measured P-V data at 300 K and 330 K were obtained from 3D tomography reconstruction data. The existence of a liquid-liquid phase transition region is proposed based on the abnormal compressibility of Ga melt at about 2.44 GPa and 330 K conditions.",

            "abstract": "Barmah-Millewa Forest (BMF), the largest River Red Gum forest in the world, located in south-eastern Australia is suffering from severe dieback, thus diminishing its ecological and economical value. Previous research showed that dieback is a good predictor of the forest health and stressed the need for BMF health mapping and change monitoring. In this respect, airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral imaging offer extensive spatial and spectral coverage of measurements and represent an ideal tool for forest health mapping at individual tree scale. The aim of this project is to quantify the health of individual, structurally complex floodplain eucalypt trees by integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery, full-waveform laser scans and field measurements. An aerial survey, conducted in May 2014, was designed to provide a representative sample of BMF tree health. The positioning of 17 flight lines aimed to capture the heterogeneity of the forest health and flood frequency. Preliminary analysis of the aerial remote sensing data with regards to chlorophyll concentrations, dieback levels and canopy densities allowed us to target our field campaign (conducted in June 2014). Field measurements included accurate position measurements, LAI, visual assessment, spectral measurement and mensuration of individual trees in 30 m2 plots. For detection of individual tree trunks from airborne laser scans we used a novel approach based on Euclidean distance clustering, taking advantage of the intensity and pulse width difference between woody and leaf tree compartments. The detected trunks were used to seed a minimum cut algorithm for tree crown delineation. In situ measurements confirmed the high structural diversity of the forest and allowed the calibration of the tree detection algorithm. An overall accuracy of the tree detection of 54% and 67% was achieved for trees with circumference over 40 cm and over 100 cm respectively. As a further step, 3D point clusters representing individual trees were used in conjunction with hyperspectral imagery to assess tree health in more detail. The detailed floodplain eucalypt tree health map, derived from aerial remote sensing data, will be further extrapolated to the whole forest using WorldView-2 imagery to produce a seamless, high resolution health map of the entire forest.",

            "abstract": "Microbial assimilation of C-N and the physicochemical protection of soil organic matter (SOM) play fundamental roles in regulating land-atmosphere interactions. However, these microbial and physicochemical processes are not explicitly represented in current region/global terrestrial ecosystem models, e.g., the Community Land Model (CLM). The lack of explicit representation of microbial pools and functions results in unrealistic fixed-C:N ratios in SOM pools currently in CLM. Thus current soil C-N model configuration is inadequate to model the effects of litter inputs or fertilization on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization and linkages between plant litter C:N ratios and soil or microbial C:N ratios. We propose a coupled C-N model that allows for flexible C:N ratios in microbe and SOM pools and thus the ability to represent the decomposition response to fertilization and/or litter inputs with various C:N ratios. Our preliminary analysis has shown that the C:N ratios in SOM, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and microbial pools can be well constrained by the new C-N model and microbes regulate the C:N ratios in SOM and DOM pools. We will use this new model framework to evaluate the soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization processes under conditions of excess organic C, excess organic N, or limited mineral N.",

            "abstract": "Gas-phase oxidation mechanisms for organic gases are often used as a starting point to understand heterogeneous oxidation. The reaction of a simple alkane hydrocarbon by OH proceeds through hydrogen abstraction and under ambient conditions leads to peroxy radical (RO2) formation. RO2 can further react to form: (1) smaller molecular weight products (i.e. fragmentation) via alkoxy radical formation and dissociation and/or (2) higher molecular weight products with oxygenated functional groups (i.e. functionalization). The ability to perturb these two pathways (functionalization vs. fragmentation) is critical for understanding the detailed reaction mechanism that control atmospheric aging chemistry of particles. At high temperatures the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) during organic-OH gas-phase oxidation enhances the fragmentation pathway leading to increased alkoxy formation. It is unknown if a comparative affect occurs at room temperature during a heterogeneous reaction. We used the heterogeneous reaction of OH radicals with sub-micron squalane particles in the presence and absence of SO2 as a model system to explore changes in individual mechanistic pathways. Detailed kinetic measurements were made in a flow tube reactor using a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer and oxidation products are identified from samples collected on quartz filters using thermal desorption two-dimensional chromatographic separation and ionization by either VUV (10.5 eV) or electron impact (70 eV), with detection by high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-VUV/EI-HRTOFMS). In the presence of SO2 the yields of alcohols were enhanced compared to without SO2, suggesting that the alkoxy formation pathway was dominant. The results from this work will provide an experimentally-confirmed kinetic framework that could be used to model atmospheric aging mechanisms. ",

            "abstract": "We present the results of a series of tests that probe the possible existence of compositionally distinct material in the central core of the LLSVPs under the African and Pacific plates using tomography-based mantle flow models that employ several independently-derived viscosity profiles (Mitrovica & Forte 2004, Behn et al. 2004, Steinberger & Calderwood 2006, Forte et al. 2010). We also consider four global tomography models derived from seismic shear velocity data alone (Grand 2002, Panning & Romanowicz 2006, Kustowski et al. 2008, Ritsema et al. 2011). The possible combinations of viscosity and tomography models yield 16 different tests for compositional heterogeneity inside the LLSVPs. In all tests we begin with a mineral physical scaling between lower-mantle shear velocity and density anomalies that assumes thermal effects are dominant everywhere, including within the LLSVPs. We find it is not possible, in any of the tests, to obtain a satisfactory fit to surface geodynamic data, especially the global, long-wavelength gravity anomalies and space-geodetic inferences of excess CMB flattening with a purely thermal interpretation of lower-mantle heterogeneity. If we introduce compositionally-distinct material in the central portions of the LLSVPs, all tests show a notable improvement in the fit to the gravity anomaly and CMB ellipticity data. An optimal reconciliation of the gravity and CMB data is obtained by extending compositional heterogeneity upwards, with maximum-amplitude in the seismic D\"-layer and tapering off to negligible values in the mid-mantle. A robust assessment of the dynamical impact of this deeply-rooted compositional heterogeneity is obtained with maps of \"mean\" convective flow, by averaging the results of all 16 test cases. We find (see map below) dominant lower-mantle upwellings below the axis of the East Pacific Rise (EPR), and under the Caroline Islands in the Western Pacific. Under the African plate we find large-scale upwellings under the southern half of the East African Rift and under the Cape Verde Islands. The EPR \"plume\" has a special significance because of its association with Earth's dominant spreading ridge and plate-kinematic inferences of strong lateral fixity of this ridge over the past 83 Ma (Rowley et al. 2011).",

            "abstract": "Within the past decade, two successful rapid-response drilling projects have measured breakouts within the nearfault of a recently ruptured fault. Breakout observation is the direct way to detect the far and near filed stress orientation in drilling. Here we compare those data. In 2006, ICDP performed an inland drilling project to penetrate Chelungpu fault plane in central of Taiwan, which had recently slipped in 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake. This drilling project succeeded in full coring and collecting comprehensive logging data in the borehole. The resistivity images run by Formation Micro Imager (FMI) indicated that a breakout rotation in the vicinity of the fault (1111mbf). Leak-off tests on site constrained the magnitude of minimum horizontal principal stress. Here we use these data to determine the stress variation in the fault plane in our breakout dislocation model. Based on the amount of breakout azimuth, rotation and fault geometry, the stress drop can be estimated in this model. In 2012, IODP initiated a rapid drilling project after the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake in Japan Trench. Due to the deep-water depth, only a real-time resistivity image recorded by Logging While Drilling (LWD) and few core samples are recovered by this expedition. However, the breakout azimuth occurred near the plate boundary (820mbsf) represents the stress disturbance after the dramatic slip comparing to TCDP case. In this research, we are attempting to discuss the possible effect factors and reconstruct the geo-mechanical models to interpret the breakout distribution observed from logging data and the stress state after these huge earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Integrated hydrologic models coupled to land surface models link water and energy movement between the subsurface, land surface and atmosphere. These connections are especially important when estimating a complex, nonlinear process like evapotranspiration (ET). In this work, a comprehensive sensitivity study of the method used to estimate ET in the ParFlow-Common Land Model (PF-CLM) is presented. Particular attention is paid to the forms of parameterizations used as well as to interactions between the groundwater and land surface models. Using this gained insight, estimates of ET from reduced forms of the parameterizations are directly compared to fully-coupled PF-CLM results. With this approach, several forms of the parameterizations are developed that vary in complexity, nonlinearity and coupling strength. The same forcing data is used to compare estimates of ET across all formulations, thus exploring the process and coupling sensitivity in a novel way. The goals of this research are to understand the sensitivity of ET estimates to parameterization complexity and establish relationships that can be used to scale ET from the tree (meter) to sub-watershed (kilometer) scale. Here we use a single column model equilibrated with atmospheric forcing from a snow-dominated alpine region (Breckenridge, Colorado, USA). Results show how subsurface pressure, ground temperature, atmospheric forcing, atmospheric stability and the fraction of wetted foliage uniquely compound to influence estimates of ET. Differences in ET magnitude are observed as the parameterization complexity changes; however, trends remain consistent throughout the year. The relationship between ET and subsurface pressure varies nonlinearly as a result of introduced resistance factors and the slope depends on ground surface temperature and parameterization complexity. Identification of sensitive interactions and driving factors are necessary to further understand hydrologic processes like ET.",

            "abstract": "The focus of the majority of studies looking into the evolving tropical pacific climate on glacial/interglacial timescales has been the role of the changing orbital forcing. While this is of course the fundamental forcing that drives changes in the climate on these time scales, without a fully interactive Earth System Model the effects that the evolving ice sheets/sea level and green house gases have on the climate will be missed. In the absence of such models these other forcings must be imposed. While the impact on the temperature in both the high latitudes, and to some extent in the tropics, of all of the forcings is reasonably clear, their impact on the hydroclimate is less obvious. In this study we shall investigate what role all of the different forcings that vary over a glacial/interglacial cycle play on the hydroclimate in the eastern Tropical Pacific.\nWe use as the basis of our study a set of three climate model experiments using the model HadCM3. Each of these simulates the last 120 thousand years as a series of time slices in one of three configurations: varying the orbital forcing; varying the orbital and greenhouse gas forcing; varying the orbital, greenhouse and ice sheet/sea level forcing. With these experiments we can deconvolve the role that each forcing plays. We will show that, in addition to the orbital forcing, both the greenhouse gas forcing and the ice sheet configuration have a large impact on the eastern Tropical Pacific's hydroclimate. Using a set of more idealised model simulations we shall elucidate the mechanisms by which each of these different forcing mechanism causes the simulated changes.",

A simple observatory was deployed in the wellhead installed during Exp 343 during the follow-up Exp 343T.\n In certain intervals during coring we mostly recovered loose, subrounded fine gravel clasts of the two major lithologies penetrated to those depths (silt and mudstones). We have performed particle shape and size analysis on these gravel aggregates. Particle shape variations apparent visually are not clearly quantified by conventional ‘shape descriptors’.

            "abstract": "The source of the intriguing surface chemistry of the icy moon, Europa has been widely debated. Of primary interest is the process of surface-ice-shell-ocean exchange of trace chemistry. Of particular astrobiological interest is the possible endogenic origin of the surface chemistry. The viscous lid atop the ice-shell poses a physical barrier for such a material exchange to occur. We have performed a computational study of thermochemical convection models to test the weakening of this viscous lid by warmer plumes of lower compositional density rising in the ice-shell. We modeled a two-phase convecting ice-ocean system with a low viscosity proxy fluid approximation for the liquid ocean. On achieving a stable convecting system, the newly frozen ice at the base of the warm ice plumes at the shell-ocean boundary is tracked and mapped as it is advected upwards by the rising plumes. The newly formed ice is prescribed a lower intrinsic density than the ambient ice to mimic the scenario where compositional contrasts in the ice-shell could exist. We then study how the rising compositional plumes incorporated with the low intrinsic density new ice can erode the stagnant lid at the top of the ice-shell. Several values of density contrast have been modeled to study any variability in their extent of erosion of the lid.\nThe models show that in a convecting ice-ocean system, it is possible for less dense newly formed ice to incorporate into the convecting ice plumes and erode the lid over time. The results suggest that if oceanic trace chemistry were to be incorporated into the newly frozen ice at the ice-ocean interface, it could be possible for it to reach the surface by continual erosion of the viscous ice lid at the top of the shell. This presents a plausible scenario for surface detection of an endogenic chemical signature that could be a potential biosignature of subsurface life in Europa.",

            "abstract": "The Asia Monsoon is among Earth’s most intriguing and spectacular phenomena. The Indian Monsoon System (IMS) is a regional manifestation this continental-scale phenomenon with complex characteristics and predictive challenges. India exhibits one of the largest rates of population growth that relies on IMS cycle for water supply. Thus, understanding the temporal variability of the IMS is essential to realistically predict the impacts of climate change on Asia’s water resources and food security. Here we investigate intraseasonal-to-interannual variability of the IMS in the climate of the 20th century using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and examine future scenarios of climate change using the high spatial resolution models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project. IMS is characterized with a large-scale index continuous in time and obtained by performing combined EOF analysis (CEOF) of variables that characterize the monsoon cycle: precipitation, low level circulation at 10 m, specific humidity and temperature at 2m. CFSR is used to derive the index (1979-2013). Projections of the CEOF onto the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) indicate that the first CEOF captures the large-scale features of the South and East Asia Monsoon. The second CEOF is associated with the IMS and its time coefficient is used as large-scale index for the IMS (LIMS). LIMS realistically defines IMS onset and withdrawal, and its amplitude associates with total seasonal precipitation. Moreover, the spectral analysis of the ISMI shows peaks on intraseasonal timescales that are related to IMS’s active and break phases. Moreover, we demonstrate that LIMS identifies the interannual variability of IMS and can be used to investigate floods and droughts that have occurred over India. Similar approach is used to investigate the skill of the CMIP5 models in realistically simulating active and break phases of the IMS in the ‘historic’ run (1951-2005). We select the models that best represent the intraseasonal variability of IMS and examine projected changes in the amplitude and persistence of the break and active periods in the high-emission representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (2006-2100). This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF- 1116105).",

            "abstract": "Recent Arctic changes suggest alterations in the export of freshwater from the Arctic to the North Atlantic, with conceivable impacts on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation. Approximately 50% of the Arctic outflow exits west of Greenland, traveling through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) and into Baffin Bay before crossing Davis Strait. The CAA outflow contributes over 50% of the net southward freshwater outflow through Davis Strait. The remainder is deeper outflow from Baffin Bay, flow from the West Greenland Current and runoff from West Greenland and CAA glaciers.\nSince September 2004, an observational program in Davis Strait has quantified volume and freshwater transport variability. The year-round program includes velocity, temperature and salinity measurements from 15 moorings spanning the full width (330 km) of the strait accompanied by autonomous Seagliders surveys (average profile separation = 4 km) and autumn ship-based hydrographic sections. Over the shallow Baffin Island and West Greenland shelves, moored instrumentation provides temperature and salinity measurements near the ice-ocean interface. From 2004-2013, the average net volume and liquid freshwater transports are -1.6 ± 0.2 Sv, -94 ± 7 mSv, respectively (salinity referenced to 34.8 and negative indicates southward transport); sea ice contributes an additional -10 ± 1 mSv. Over this period, volume and liquid freshwater transports show significant interannual variability and no clear trends, but a comparison with reanalyzed 1987-90 data indicate a roughly 40% decrease in net southward liquid volume transport and a corresponding an almost 30% decrease in freshwater transport. Connections between the Arctic are also captured, e.g., a unique yearlong Davis Strait freshening event starting September 2009 that was likely driven by an earlier freshening (January 2009 – April/May 2010) in the Canadian Arctic. The Davis Strait autumn 2009 salinity minimum was fresher (by about 0.2), lasted longer, and spanned a greater distance across the strait than in other years.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) is a shallow subglacial water reservoir covered by 800m of ice. A custom-built hot-water drill was used to access SLW in a microbiologically clean way in late January 2013. Lake access for sampling and in-situ measurements was maintained for a total of 3 days. We deployed an array of scientific tools through a large diameter borehole: a downhole camera, a conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) probe, a Niskin water sampler, an in situ filtration unit, three different sediment corers, a geothermal probe and a geophysical sensor string. We confirm the existence of a subglacial water body whose presence was inferred from satellite altimetry and surface geophysics. Subglacial water is about two orders of magnitude less saline than sea water (0.37–0.41 psu vs 35 psu) and two orders of magnitude more saline than pure drill meltwater (<0.002 psu). It reaches a minimum temperature of –0.55 degrees C, consistent with depression of the freezing point by pressure from ca. 800m of ice. Subglacial remained turbid throughout the observation period. The recovered sediment cores contained a macroscopically structureless diamicton with shear strength between 2 and 6 kPa. Our recommendation for future subglacial access through water-filled boreholes in cold ice is to supply heat to the top of the borehole to keep it from freezing. Development of a centimeters-thick ice layer on top of the borehole water column prevented deployment of some light borehole tools.",

            "abstract": "The gigantic Dabashan orocline, situated in the south Qinling Orogen, is a response of the tectonic uplift to the collision between the North China Craton and the Yangtze Craton in Mesozoic. However, how the orocline formed and deformed is still not well understood mainly due to inaccessible deep crust structures. In this study, we aim to address this question by investigating the detailed crust structures.\nWe process continuous ambient noise data collected from ~170 stations of Chinese provincial networks operating during 2007 and 2009 to extract interstation surface wave dispersion curves. Using these dispersion curves, we generate Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps at 6-60 sec periods. By inverting the resulting Rayleigh wave dispersion maps using a Bayesian Monte Carlo method, we construct a 3D isotropic Vsv model with a lateral resolution of 50-60 km. The 3D Vsv model reveals detailed crust velocity structures which help to decipher the formation mechanism of the Dabashan orocline.\nProminent low velocities are observed beneath the Dabashan orocline at 10-15 km depth, which may represent the buried passive continental margin sedimentations of the Yangtze Craton. High velocities are observed on the two sides of the orocline beneath the Shengnongjia-Huangling and Hannan Domes extending from the surface with Archean-aged outcrops to the mid/lower crust. The deep-rooted high-velocity domes very likely reflect the presence of the relative rigid Archean basement which acts as obstacles during the intra-continental shortening; while detachments may develop in the weak passive continental margin of sedimentations beneath the Dabashan during the shortening process, assisting the southward thrusting of nappes from the south Qinling Orogen onto the northern margin of the Yangtze Craton, which finally forms the gigantic Dabashan orocline. This model is also consistent with the thermo-chronological constraints and stratigraphic records which together indicate the initiation of the uplifts in the two domes are possibly earlier than in Dabashan.",

            "abstract": "Microbial oxidation of hydrocarbon released from marine sediments at ocean margin triggers deposite of authigenic carbonates. These carbonates excellently archive ancient seepage activies. Here, we report petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of a carbonate deposit discovered in the Cretaceous deep-sea fan section in Tibet, providing diagnostic information on hydrocarbon seepage origin. The carbonates occur as clustered, isolated, chimney-like and stratoid concretions, enclosed in the Cenomanian turbidite siltstone. These concretions consist of carbonate (63.2% on average), clastic quartz and feldspar (23.2% on average), and clay minerals (13.5% on average). They exhibit negative δ13C values ranging from -34.1‰ to -12.9‰, indicating a carbon origin from seeping thermogenic methane. A relatively deep origin of thermogenic methane is also supported by the lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios (from 0.706221 to 0.706808). The carbonates have low δ18O values varying from -13.1‰ to -2.2‰, most of which indicate diagenetic alteration. The negative linearity between oxygen and carbon isotopic values suggests a diagenetic fluid with relatively high δ13C values and high temperature. The shale-normalized REE patterns show varied Ce anomalies. Most samples with no real Ce anomaly illustrate reducing environments. The stratoid concretions and an isolated concretion just above the clustered concretions have real negative Ce anomalies suggesting changeable redox conditions and several sudden changes of flux rate possibly resulted from suspended-reactive cycles of seep activities. Several cycles within short time are likely related with the paroxysmal activities of turbidite sedimentation, which would result in fast loading and finally promote hydrocarbon seeps. There are indications of more widely occurring seep deposits in Cretaceous strata located in Tibet, raising the question if all these hydrocarbon seeps are promoted by regional structure activities.\nAknowlegements: This work was supported by the NSFC (41273041).",

            "abstract": "In fluvial systems, biofilms are the main driver of biogeochemical transformations. Biofilms grow on most surfaces in the benthic and hyporheic regions, where they process waterborne solutes. These solutes are transported in the regional flow and their fluxes near the biofilms are controlled by local physical properties, such as head gradients and hydraulic conductivity. These properties are in turn influenced by the growth of the biofilm itself, which can clog porous media and/or develop its own network of porous space. Therefore, the residence time of a solute in proximity to biofilm surfaces, where it can be processed, should be influenced by the properties not only of the physical environment, but by that of the biofilm itself. We hypothesized that the presence of biofilms would increase residence times in the benthic and shallow subsurface regions of the stream bed. We performed controlled experiments in 4 experimental streams at Notre Dame's Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility (ND-LEEF) to quantify the interaction between substrate and biofilm in controlling anomalous solute transport. Each stream at ND-LEEF had a different substrate configuration: 2 with homogeneous substrate but with different sizes (pea gravel vs. coarse gravel) and 2 with heterogeneous substrate (alternating sections vs. well-mixed reaches). We measured the evolution of the residence time distributions in the streams by injecting rhodamine tracer (RWT) multiple times over the course of a 5 month colonization gradient. Analysis of breakthrough curves demonstrated that in addition to the influence of substrate, biofilm colonization and growth significantly influenced the residence time in the system. Specifically, as biofilms grew, the power-law exponent of the RTD decreased, i.e. the tails of the distributions became heavier, suggesting prolonged retention due to the presence of the biofilms. Although the substrate signature persisted over time, with the coarser gravel bed washing out faster than the smaller gravel bed, all streams had a similar pattern of the power law exponent decreasing exponentially over time. These results demonstrate benthic control of anomalous solute transport through the dynamic relationship and feedback between the physical and biological environments.",

With earthquakes often hitting the news headlines the Australian Seismometers in Schools (AuSIS) program utilizes the resulting public awareness and curiosity, providing tools and support for teachers and students to find out more. Most teachers are unaware of the wealth of resources available and often lack confidence to teach earth science, as they have little to no formal training. With the introduction of earth science to the national curriculum it has become imperative teachers receive this support. AuSIS connects students and teachers with earthquake data relevant to them that is both real-time and easily accessible. The biggest challenge faced is often how to engage with remote and rural communities over the vast Australian continent. Our approach has been to take information to the teachers, providing workshops at national science teacher conferences and developing guides that provide step-by-step instructions for classroom activities. These professional development workshops include hands-on demonstrations as well as online discovery. The data recorded at schools on our network of seismometers is publicly accessible and is shared with scientists, amateur seismologists and students alike, this provides students with a sense of involvement in the scientific community. We link teachers with additional online resources and utilize social media to alert them to interesting earth science facts and earthquake activity. For continued exploration we provide easy access to our data and earthquake information through a mobile app and website. Our website combines both local and global earthquake catalogs to provide a one-stop shop of earthquake information of interest to the teachers and students. We also encourage online interactions with teachers through a forum on our website and through social media aimed to provide continued support.",

Denitrification and anammox, the main N loss processes from the ocean, have different effects on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emission. Understanding the balance between the two processes is vital to understanding the role of the N cycle in global climate change. One approach for investigating these processes is by using stable isotope analysis to estimate the relative magnitudes of N fluxes, particularly for biologically mediated processes. In order to make the most of the currently available isotope analysis techniques, it is necessary to know the isotope effects for each processes occurring in the environment. Nitrite reduction is an important step in denitrification. Previous work had begun to explore the N isotope effects for nitrite reduction, but no oxygen (O) isotope effect has been measured. Additionally, no consideration has been given to the type of nitrite reductase carrying out the reaction. There are two main types of respiratory nitrite reductase, one that is Cu-based and another that is Fe-based. We performed batch culture experiments with denitrifier strains possessing either a Cu-type or Fe-type nitrite reductase. Both N and O isotope effects for nitrite reduction were determined for each of these experiments by measuring the NO2- concentration, as well as the N and O isotopes of nitrite and applying a Rayleigh fractionation model. Both the N and O isotope effects were found to be significantly different between the two types of enzymes. This enzyme-linked difference in isotope effects emphasizes the importance of microbial community composition within the global N cycle.",

            "abstract": "Data and its management are central to modern scientific enterprise. Typically, geoscientists rely on observations and model output data from several disparate sources (file systems, RDBMS, spreadsheets, remote data sources). Integrated data management solutions that provide intuitive semantics and uniform interfaces, irrespective of the kind of data source are, however, lacking. Consequently, geoscientists are left to conduct low-level and time-consuming data management tasks, individually, and repeatedly for discovering each data source, often resulting in errors in handling.\nIn this talk we will describe how the EarthCube GeoDataspace project is improving this situation for seismologists, hydrologists, and space scientists by simplifying some of the existing data management tasks that arise when developing computational models. We will demonstrate a GeoDataspace, bootstrapped with “geounits”, which are self-contained metadata packages that provide complete description of all data elements associated with a model run, including input/output and parameter files, model executable and any associated libraries. Geounits link raw and derived data as well as associating provenance information describing how data was derived. We will discuss challenges in establishing geounits and describe machine learning and human annotation approaches that can be used for extracting and associating ad hoc and unstructured scientific metadata hidden in binary formats with data resources and models. We will show how geounits can improve search and discoverability of data associated with model runs. To support this model, we will describe efforts related towards creating a scalable metadata catalog that helps to maintain, search and discover geounits within the Globus network of accessible endpoints. This talk will focus on the issue of creating comprehensive personal inventories of data assets for computational geoscientists, and describe a publishing mechanism, which can be used to feed into national, international, or thematic discovery portals.",

It has been shown that the model resolution is the key in simulating a lot of atmospheric phenomena. In this study, the summertime heat waves in North America and the associated ridging/blocking activity are characterized using reanalysis data and global climate models with different horizontal resolutions (~120 km / ~30 km) and ocean modules (prescribe/interactive). The typical synoptic features accompanying the heat waves are depicted. The frequency of occurrence and intensity of the upstream blockings are examined.\nThe discrepancy between the reanalysis and the models on the heat wave characteristics as well as the upstream blocking activity is assessed by comparing the passage of synoptic-scale transients and its local reinforcement to the anticyclonic circulation. The result indicates: 1) a general agreement on the first moment of climatological distribution with different resolution; 2) the higher resolution model can improve the high-order moments of the atmosphere circulation, including the weather regimes, which is critical to a reliable simulation and projection of the climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "A voyage was conducted aboard the RV Southern Surveyor in early 2013 to investigate the east Australian continental margin. From the continental slope of the Wide Bay region offshore Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia, remote sensing data and sediment samples were collected. Bathymetric data reveals that the continental slope of the region presents a mature canyon system. Eight dredge samples were recovered from the walls of Wide Bay Canyon and the adjacent, relatively intact continental slope along the entire length of the slope, from the start of the shelf break to the toe, in water depths ranging from 1100-2500 m.\nFor these samples, sediment composition, biostratigraphic age, and bulk mineralogy data are reported. These slope-forming sediments are primarily comprised of calcareous sandy-silts. Occasional terrestrial plant fossils and minerals can be found in a mostly marine-fossiliferous composition, suggesting minor but significant riverine and aeolian input. Biostratigraphic dates extracted from the foraminiferal contents of these samples indicate that the intra-canyon and slope material was deposited between Middle Miocene to Pliocene, implying that the incision of this section of the margin and formation of the erosional features took place no earlier than the Pliocene. In conjunction with bathymetric data of the local continental slope, the depositional origins of this section of the east Australian continental margin, and the timing of major morphological events such as slope failure and canyon incision can be interpreted.\nThe Wide Bay Canyon system can serve as a representative case study of local canyon formation, allowing a better understanding of the past or ongoing processes that are shaping the margin and giving way to similar morphologies.",

            "abstract": "Supply of suspended sediment is critical for the development and sustainability of tidal wetlands. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is also a key parameter used in calibrating wetland accretion models, which aid in understanding restoration dynamics and projecting resilience to sea-level rise. Despite the importance of suspended sediment, few field studies have directly measured SSC within tidal wetlands, relying instead on measurements in adjacent waters or focusing on long-term rates of sediment accretion. We refined and tested a simple method for collecting SSC samples within wetlands on an incoming high tide, using siphon collectors. Bottles were positioned during low tide at set locations along transects extending away from either channels or the lower boundary of the vegetated wetland. This sampling protocol was developed collaboratively, with substantial input from local wetland managers and other stakeholders within the San Francisco Bay area and beyond. Simultaneously, we measured time series of SSC, water level, and tidal currents in the subtidal shallows, on the intertidal mudflats, and in two channels within the wetland. We observed significant sediment export during king tides in the wetland channels. Cumulative suspended sediment flux (SSF) over four days during the January 2014 king tides was approximately 10 tons/m of channel width, towards the bay. During neap tides SSF in the channels was directed landward but was lower in magnitude. Elevated velocities in the channels during ebb king tides suggest that resuspension within the channels, rather than erosion of the wetland, accounts for much of the bayward SSF. Within the wetland, SSC from the siphon samplers was highest at the bayward end of the cross-shore transects, indicating landward sediment flux. Taken together with long term accretion data which indicates sediment accumulation within the wetland, our results suggest that sediment is primarily supplied across the wetland-Bay interface, and exported from the wetland through tidal channels. These findings are relevant to the design and monitoring of restored wetlands, which frequently rely on transport through breaches for sediment supply. They also indicate the importance of accounting for sediment export as well as import in modeling the response of wetlands to sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "A growing need for broad dissemination of current scientific research and improved scientific literacy requires new models of professional development that allow for direct collaboration between educators and university researchers. One example is a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of a study titled, “Reconstructing 2500 years of environmental change at the periphery of Rome: Integrating paleoecology and socioeconomic history to understand human response to climate.” This project involves a team of middle school teachers working with researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) to gain first-hand knowledge in multidisciplinary research connecting science and society, and applies a similar approach in the classroom. In 2013, the team’s science teacher traveled to Italy as a member of the science research group. A series of workshops introduced the remaining teachers to the research project. Teachers collaborated to develop a Project Based Learning (PBL) unit that incorporated Next Generation Science Standards and encompassed English, Social Studies, Math, and Science curricula using a pedagogical approach different from the single subject-based PBL’s usually taught in their school district. The PBL unit draws on the NSF study and focuses on exploring the balance between economic and environmental issues surrounding local wetlands. In May 2014, 160 middle school students worked in groups to create and test a question about physio-chemical parameters in a nearby wetland and used these data to discuss local economic development. Initially, students claimed polarized views of environmental issues or economic development interests; however, during a multimedia session showcasing results, students communicated more informed perspectives that clearly incorporated knowledge gained from their own research. Some students were able to make recommendations for good practices involving planned economic development near the wetland. Preliminary outcomes suggests this model: 1) permits authentic exploration of the role of scientific research in making informed policy decisions; 2) promotes diverse perspectives when approaching environmental and socioeconomic problems; and 3) enhances group engagement in developing scientific literacy.",

We presented the likely inundation areas, current velocities in key ports and harbors, physical damage and repair costs, economic consequences, environmental impacts, social vulnerability, emergency management, and policy implications for California associated with the scenario tsunami. The intended users were those responsible for making mitigation decisions before and those who need to make rapid decisions during future tsunamis. The Tsunami Scenario process is being evaluated by the University of Colorado’s Natural Hazards Center; this is the first time that a USGS scenario of this scale has been formally and systematically evaluated by an external party.\nThe SAFRR Tsunami Scenario was publicly introduced in September, 2013, through a series of regional workshops in California that brought together emergency managers, maritime authorities, first responders, elected officials and staffers, the business sector, state agencies, local media, scientific partners, and special districts such as utilities (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1170/).\nIn March, 2014, NOAA’s annual tsunami warning exercise, PACIFEX, was based on the SAFRR Tsunami Scenario. Many groups conducted exercises associated with PACIFEX including the State of Washington and several counties in California. San Francisco had the most comprehensive exercise with a 3-day functional exercise based on the SAFRR Tsunami Scenario. In addition, the National Institutes of Health ran an exercise at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in April, 2014, building on the Tsunami Scenario, focusing on the recovery phase and adding a refinery fire.\n The benefits and lessons learned include: 1) stimulating dialogue among practitioners to solve problems; 2) seeing groups add extra components to their exercises that best address their specific concerns; 3) providing groups with information packaged specifically for them; 4) recognizing the value of having scenario developers personally present the scenario to user groups and 5) having the SAFRR work applied to support ongoing activities by and future directions of the California state tsunami program.",

            "abstract": "Plume activity of Enceladus has been monitored by Cassini for nearly one decade after their discovery (see Science, 2006, 311, special issue). Thus, crucial properties of the vapor dust plumes are constrained in a fairly detailed manner. In this paper I discuss implications for vent geometries, gas and grain dynamics and condensation in the vents.\nVapor source rates on the order of 100 to 1000kg/s were derived from remote and in-situ data [2, 3, 4, 1, 17] and distortions in the B field [10, 15]). Gas ejection speeds from 500m/s to 1000m/s [18, 4] (escape speed 240m/s) indicate supersonic gas flow. Evidence for supersonic gas jets is directly seen in UVIS data [3].\nDust production rates between 5 to 50kg/s have been inferred [16, 8]. These do not yet include mass in jets of very fine nano-grains [9, 8, 7]. The dust plume exhibits scale heights that suggest ejection speeds on the order of 100m/s [13, 16, 6], i.e. well below the escape velocity. Larger grains have smaller ejection spees populating the lower parts of the plume [6, 16]. Salt has been identified in grains on the percent level [14] so that they cannot form alone by condensation from vapor. The detailed distribution of dust sources and jet orientations on the south polar terrain was derived from images and compared to temperature distributions and to the expected tidal stress pattern from modelling [12].\nA recent observations show that plume brightness varies roughly by a factor of three with the orbital period of Enceladus, suggesting that ejection strength is tidally controlled [11, 5]. A similar variation in the gas discharge is expected but has not yet been observed to date. Remarkably, there is no such correlation of orbital phase and the observed scale height of dust jets.\n[1] Dong et al, JGR, 116, 2011\n[2] Hansen et al, Science, 311, 2006.\n[3] Hansen et al, Nature, 456, 2008.\n[4] Hansen et al, GRL, 38, 2011.\n[5] Hedman et al, Nature, 2013.\n[6] Hedman et al, ApJ, 693, 2009.\n[7] Hill et al, JGR, 117, 2012.\n[8] Ingersoll and Ewald, Icarus, 216, 2011.\n[9] Jones et al, GRL, 36, 2009.\n[10] Meier et al, submitted to PSS, 2014.\n[11] Nimmo et al, AstronJ, 148, 2014.\n[12] Porco et al, AstronJ, 148, 2014.\n[13] Porco et al, Science, 311, 2006.\n[14] Postberg et al, Nature, 474, 2011.\n[15] Saur et al, GRL, 35, 2008.\n[16] Schmidt et al, Nature, 451, 2008.\n[17] Smith et al, JGR, 115, 2010.\n[18] Tian et al, Icarus, 188, 2007.",

Our research plan has brought together colleagues from several international institutions, all with a common goal to better understand the large “continental-scale” characteristics and impacts of gravity waves on the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) environment over Antarctica. ANGWIN combines complementary measurements obtained using new and existing aeronomy instrumentation with new modeling capabilities. To date, our activities have focused on developing coordinated airglow image data of gravity waves in the MLT region at the following sites: McMurdo (US), Syowa (Japan), Davis (Australia), Halley (UK), Rothera (UK), and Comandante Ferraz (Brazil). These are all well-established international research stations that are uniformly distributed around the continental perimeter, and together with ongoing measurements at South Pole Station they provide unprecedented coverage of the Antarctic gravity wave field and its variability during the extended polar winter season. This presentation introduces the ANGWIN program and research goals, and presents first results on trans-Antarctic wave propagation using coordinated measurements during the winter season 2011. We also discuss future plans for the development of this exciting program for Antarctic research.",

The relevant theory was developed a few decades ago, however, mainly due to computational limitations, several approximations are commonly employed, and thus far the full merits of the complete theory have not been taken advantage of. In this study, we present an exact algebraic form of the theory for an aspherical, anelastic and rotating earth model in which either complex or real spherical harmonic bases are used. Physical dispersion is incorporated into the quadratic eigenvalue problem by expanding the logarithmic frequency term to 2nd order. In addition, we carry out numerical experiments up to 3 mHz to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of commonly used approximate mode synthetics. We find that (1) approximating mode frequencies for realistic earth models with an average over degenerate frequencies of two coupled modes for physical dispersion, Coriolis effects and perturbed kinematic energy terms gives rise to subtle di\u001bfferences in mode spectra; (2) taking into account the exact normalization of modes instead of the one for a spherical, non-rotation model improves mode spectra by ~2%; (3) consideration of mode coupling in a narrow frequency band yields up to 10% discrepancies in mode spectra compared with wide-band coupling, indicating that the popular splitting function approach may introduce slight biases in normal-mode tomography.",

            "abstract": "The coronal mass ejection (CME) event on April 3, 2010 is the first fast CME observed by STEREO SECCHI/HI for the full Sun-Earth line. Such an event provides us a good opportunity to study the propagation and evolution of CME from the Sun up to 1 AU. In this paper, we study the time-dependent evolution and propagation of this event from the Sun to Earth using the 3D SIP-CESE MHD model. The CME is initiated by a simple spherical plasmoid model: a spheromak magnetic structure with high speed, high pressure and high plasma density plasmoid. We find that the results can successfully reproduce the observations in the STEREO A/B COR1 and COR2 field of view and generate many basic structures of the in situ measurement: such as the similar curves of the plasma density and velocity, an increase in the magnetic field magnitude, the large-scale smooth magnetic field rotation and prolonged southward IMF (a well known source of magnetic storms). The MHD model gives the shock arrival time at Earth with an error of ∼ 1.5 hours. Finally, we analyze in detail the propagation velocity, the spread angle, the trajectory of CME. The speed of the CME rapidly increases from near the Sun, then decreases due to interaction with the solar wind ambient. The spread angle of the CME quickly increases due to lateral material expansion by the pressure gradients within the realistic solar wind background, then the expansion decreases with distance and ends until a pressure equilibrium is established. We also study the CME deflection and find that the CME almost does not deflects in the latitudinal and longitudinal direction during its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.",

            "abstract": "Bali province of Indonesia is worldwide known for its tourist destination and it contributes more than 60 per cent to the regional domestic product. Meanwhile, agricultural sector including rice production still plays an important role in the Bali economy because of its 30 per cent contribution. Rice production in Bali is not just susceptible to loss caused by flood, drought and pest and disease attack but also from the climate change. The impact of climate change on food production in Indonesia is expected to decline in 2050, ranging from 38 per cent to more than ten-folds of the current production (Syaukat, 2011). Accordingly, adaptation to climate changes is required to minimize the risk along with the plans and strategies for food security and sustainable development.\nThe government of Indonesia (GoI) has launched several pilot projects including agriculture insurance program to minimize the risk in production failure particularly rice farming, unfortunately Bali was excluded from the projects. Implementation of agriculture insurance in Indonesia has the legal basis now after the announcement of the Farmer Protection and Empowerment Act (Law No. 19/2013). Agriculture insurance is seen better in mitigating farmer’s risk than that of the other program in rice production. The GoI plans to implement the insurance scheme in the beginning of 2015. This scheme is something “new” to farmers in Bali and Indonesia. Considering the importance of crop insurance to agriculture, this study attempts to explore the potential of such insurance to reveal a clear picture of opportunities and challenges in agriculture insurance implementation in Bali. The study empirically presents awareness and perception of farmers towards the insurance and adaptation to vulnerability of climate change. The study concludes with various suggestions for increasing the awareness of farmers for ensuring better penetration of agriculture insurance in Bali.\nKey words: agriculture insurance, farmer’s awareness and perception, climate change, Bali",

            "abstract": "Lake Kai-ike is a saline meromictic lake located along the coast of Kami-Koshiki Island. The lake is isolated from ocean by a gravel bar, through which seawater infiltrates by tidal pumping. The lake is permanently redox (density)-stratified with a mid-depth development of photic zone anoxia and a dense community of photosynthetic bacteria pinkish “bacterial plate”. The early diagenesis of sulfur in sediments overlain by an anoxic water body was investigated using a sediment core (KAI4) from the lake. We determined abundance of various S-bearing species (i.e., Cr-reducible sulfide (= pyrite S: Spy), acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), sulfate sulfur (SSO4), elemental sulfur (S0), and organic sulfur) by an improved sequential extraction method. Here we focus on drastic and rapid changes on sulfur biogeochemistry found in the uppermost 5cm layer.\nWith increasing depth, abundance of Spy increased but that of SSO4 and δ34S value of Spy (δ34Spy) decreased. These results suggest progressive formation of bacteriogenic pyrite. The δ34S values of SSO4 (δ34SSO4) ranged from 25.1 ‰ (at sediment surface) to 3.8 ‰ in the uppermost 5 cm layer. This δ34SSO4 decrease in the top 5 cm sediment suggests that SSO4 in the surface sediment inherits SO42- with elevated δ34S values (higher than typical seawater δ34S value of 21‰) in the water column, which is due to extensive bacterial sulfate reduction with preferential removal of low-δ34S sulfur as sulfide. In the lower part of the uppermost 5 cm layer, SO42- formed by oxidation of S0, AVS, and/or Spy with low-δ34S values by SO42--bearing seawater introduced by infiltration through the gravel bar. Increasing δ34Spy values with increasing depth suggest near complete consumption of SO42- by active bacterial sulfate reduction, and this process could be explained by Rayleigh distillation model.\nEarly diagenesis of sulfur does occur in whole section of 25cm-long KAI4 core that accumulated for the last ~60 years (Yamaguchi et al., 2010; Palaeo3). Geochemical characteristics of sulfur in the uppermost part of Lake Kai-ike sediment were significantly modified during early diagenesis. Such diagenetic modification for sulfur isotopes should be fully taken into account to better reconstruct past anoxic environment such as Cretaceous OAEs and Archean oceans.",

            "abstract": "Electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) during reconnection with negligible guide field from particle in cell (PIC) simulations and Cluster observations are studied to further understand electron acceleration and heating. Until recently, electrons in the exhaust of reconnection with negligible guide field were thought to be isotropic. PIC simulation results with zero guide field reveal that near the time of peak reconnection, VDFs become highly structured in magnetic islands and open exhausts. Ring, arc, and counterstreaming populations are generic and lasting constituents of exhaust electron VDFs. Analyses of particle trajectories indicate that a number of mechanisms including Fermi acceleration, the parallel potential, and adiabatic heating contribute to the energization of exhaust electrons. Near the electron diffusion region (EDR), exhaust electrons exhibit large Te⊥ due to ring and arc populations of electrons accelerated in the EDR. Farther away from the EDR, the VDFs show a mixture of electrons from the EDR and those crossing the separatrix from the inflow. Pitch angle scattering is effective near the exhaust midplane, away from the EDR and before reaching the magnetic pileup region, producing isotropic, high-energy electrons, while the low energy exhaust electrons exhibit the anisotropy Te// > Te⊥ characteristic of the inflow. The work done on the electrons by the perpendicular electric field between the end of EDR and the magnetic pileup region is due to Fermi acceleration which leads to a net increase in the electron's parallel velocity. For the net increase of electrons' v⊥ beyond the EDR, pitch angle scattering effectively converts v// gained by acceleration from the parallel potential into v⊥. Electron's v⊥ further increases downstream through adiabatic heating from the increasing magnetic field in addition to less efficient pitch angle scattering. The parallel potential and the magnetic bottle together determine the trapped-passing boundary of the distribution, and thus the apparent temperature. Thus far, we find no evidence that the parallel potential accelerates passing electrons as suggested by a prior work. Further study is underway to quantify the overall amount of energy which goes into heating electrons and generating counterstreaming beams in the magnetotail.",

The abundance of data and documents describing the uncertainty around both climate change projections and impacts has become challenging to managers who have little funding and limited time to digest and incorporate these materials into planning and implementation documents. We worked with US Forest Service and BLM managers to help them develop vulnerability assessments and identify on-the-ground strategies to address climate change challenges on the federal lands in northwest Oregon (Siuslaw, Willamette and Mt. Hood National Forests; Eugene and Salem BLM Districts). We held workshops to promote dialogue about climate change, which were particularly effective in fostering discussions between the managers who often do not have the time to share their knowledge and compare experiences across administrative boundaries. We used the Adaptation for Conservation Targets (ACT) framework to identify measurable management objectives and rapidly assess local vulnerabilities. We used databasin.org to centralize usable information, including state-of-the-art CMIP5 climate projections, for the mandated assessments of vulnerability and resilience. We introduced participants to a decision support framework providing opportunities to develop more effective adaptation strategies. We built a special web page to hold the information gathered at the workshops and provide easy access to climate change information. We are now working with several Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) to design gateways - conservation atlases - to their relevant data repositories on databasin.org and working with them to develop web tools that can provide usable information for their own vulnerability assessments.",

            "abstract": "Zhud is a term referring either to conditions when melting snow refreezes to form an icy layer covering the grass, or to unusually heavy snow falls in Eurasian arid and semi-arid regions. Under zhud condition, animals cannot obtain food under snow or ice layer, which sometimes results in zhud disaster, i.e. massive livestock kills. It has been recognized that the zhud disaster is directly induced by the harsh winter conditions but often influenced by drought in the previous summer. In this study, data-intensive reanalysis on regional determinants of zhud disaster was conducted for more than 300 soums (an administrative unit equivalent with county in US) in Mongolia. Various climatic, hydrological, and vegetation variables were developed from satellite remote sensing (RS) data, which includes daily mean air temperature, dew temperature, and evapotranspiration, monthly precipitation, and 16-day NDVI from 2003 to 2010. Annual livestock census data were collected for every soums in Mongolia. Each variable was standardized to z-score and utilized for stepwise multiple regression analysis to identify factors statistically significant for explaining soum-level livestock mortality. The regression models were successfully constructed for two-third of total soums. Considerable spatial variability in the determinants of livestock mortality was found across soums in Mongolia. As the primary determinants, summer NDVI and dryness equally explained 22% of the soum mortality, while 33% and 16% of the mortality were explained with winter temperature and precipitation, respectively. In spatial patterns, winter precipitation and temperature were primary determinants in mountain regions and northern cool and semi-arid regions, while summer NDVI and dryness were important in southern hot and arid regions. Our results indicate combined efforts of monitoring RS-based summer NDVI and dryness and forecasting winter temperature and precipitation can provide useful tools for zhud disaster early warning.",

            "abstract": "At the very smallest spatial scales of fluvial field analysis, measurements made historically in situ are often now supplemented, or even replaced by, remote sensing methods. This is particularly true in the case of topographic and particle size measurement. In the field, the scales of in situ observation usually range from millimeters up to hundreds of meters. Two recent approaches for remote mapping of river environments at the scales of historical in situ observations are (1) camera-based structure from motion (SfM), and (2) active patterned-light measurement with devices such as the Kinect. Even if only carried by hand, these two approaches can produce topographic datasets over three to four orders of magnitude of spatial scale. Which approach is most useful?\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that both SfM and the Kinect are precise and accurate over in situ field measurement scales; we instead turn to alternate comparative metrics to help determine which tools might be best for our river measurement tasks. These metrics might include (1) the ease of field use, (2) which general environments are or are not amenable to measurement, (3) robustness to changing environmental conditions, (4) ease of data processing, and (5) cost. We test these metrics in a variety of bar-scale fluvial field environments, including a large-river cobble bar, a sand-bedded river point bar, and a complex mountain stream bar.\nThe structure from motion approach is field-equipment inexpensive, is viable over a wide range of environmental conditions, and is highly spatially scalable. The approach requires some type of spatial referencing to make the data useful. The Kinect has the advantages of an almost real-time display of collected data, so problems can be detected quickly, being fast and easy to use, and the data are collected with arbitrary but metric coordinates, so absolute referencing isn’t needed to use the data for many problems. It has the disadvantages of its light field generally being unable to penetrate water surfaces, becoming unusable in strong sunlight, and providing so much data as to be sometimes unwieldy in the data processing stage.",

We compare in situ measurements of cloud microphysical properties of ice and liquid over the S. Ocean with constrained output from the atmospheric component of an Earth System Model. Observations taken during the HIAPER (the NSF/NCAR G-V aircraft) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) multi-year field campaign are compared with simulations from the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Remarkably, CESM is able to accurately simulate the locations of cloud formation, and even cloud microphysical properties are comparable between the model and observations. Significantly, the simulations do not predict sufficient supercooled liquid. Altering the model cloud and aerosol processes to better reproduce the observations of supercooled liquid acts to reduce long-standing biases in S. Ocean clouds in CESM, which are typical of other models. Furthermore, sensitivity tests show where better observational constraints on aerosols and cloud microphysics can reduce uncertainty and biases in global models. These results are intended to show how we can connect large scale simulations with field observations in the S. Ocean to better understand Southern Ocean cloud processes and reduce biases in global climate simulations.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the budget of OH (hydroxyl radical) is very important for investigating the atmospheric oxidation capacity, aerosol formation and climate change. Recent studies indicate that there may be a great gap between the modeled and measured OH concentrations in some rural forest areas. This gap may result from our incomplete knowledge about the oxidation mechanism of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we suggest that acetyl peroxy radical (CH3C(O)OO∙), the OH-initiated oxidation intermediate of most VOCs, can take the H-atom from the aldehyde group to form corresponding peroxy carboxylic acids. This reaction has not been concerned in the atmosphere. The acetyl peroxy radical may share the “oxidation responsibility” of OH, and help saving OH from being consumed by aldehyde. Using a box model coupled with the isoprene-OH reaction mechanism selected from MCM v3.2, we get OH saving ratio (SROH) when we compare the modeled OH levels in the presence and absence of the reaction of acetyl peroxy radical with aldehyde. We find that SROH is not a constant but a function of OH production rate, reaction time, isoprene concentration and the ratio of aldehyde to isoprene. It is expected that CH3C(O)OO∙ radical, a non-OH oxidant, plays an important role in maintaining the oxidation capacity of the troposphere.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which gravel is exchanged laterally from eroding banks to point bars rather than transported downstream is largely unknown in gravel-bed meanders. This is crucial for understanding the potential effects bank stabilization on channel form. We use a compilation of field data to calculate the number of bends required for the supply of gravel from bank erosion to equal transport rate of gravel through a reach (Nb). A low value of Nb suggests that most of the gravel transport by the river is derived from local bank erosion and that, in essence, gravel is being shifted from outer bank to downstream bars with little net downslope flux. We compared the migration rate in 18 gravel-bed meanders rivers with calculations of the gravel transport capacity. Using the average bend length measured for the reach, and assuming the fraction of gravel in the banks ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 of the bank height, Nb was < 1 bend for 12 of the 18 rivers and generally < 10 bends for the remainder of the rivers. The meanders with Nb<1 had Shields stresses less than 0.044, which is the median Shields stress of 115 gravel-bed meanders in the literature. We compared these results to 9 gravel-bed meanders where gravel transport rates were available but the migration rates were unknown. For these rivers, we assumed migration rates ranged from 0.005-0.1 widths/yr (the range observed for gravel-bed meanders) and the gravel fraction in the banks ranged from 0.1-0.8. Nb was ranged from <1 to 20 bends, but was generally higher than for the gravel-bed meanders where we calculated the gravel transport capacity. This is not surprising because 7 of the 9 rivers had Shields stresses > 0.045, and higher gravel transport rates would be expected for this dataset. Our calculations suggest that for many gravel-bed meanders, gravel is being exchanged between the bed and banks within one bend, and even gravel-bed meanders with higher Shields stresses are likely exchanging gravel within a given reach. Limiting channel migration may have a deleterious effect on gravel routing in many gravel-bed meanders.",

            "abstract": "Cloud and precipitation parameterization schemes are evaluated, and their sensitivity to the method and/or parameters used to determine cloud physical processes is examined using a singlecolumn version of the Unified Model (SCUM). In the experiment for TWP-ICE, cloud fraction is overestimated (underestimated) in the upper (lower) troposphere due to the wet (dry) bias. The precipitation rate is well simulated during the active monsoon period, but overestimated during the suppressed monsoon and clear skies periods. In the moist convection scheme, trigger condition and entrainment process affect the lower tropospheric humidity through the impact on convective occurrence frequency and intensity, respectively. Strengthening the trigger condition and using the adaptive entrainment method alleviate the low-level dry bias. In the microphysics scheme, more large-scale precipitation is produced with prognostic rain, due to rain sedimentation considering vertical velocity of rain drop, than with diagnostic rain. Less ice/snow deposition with the prognostic two-ice category results in lower ice water content and upper-level cloud fraction than with the diagnostic splitting method for the twoice category. In the cloud macrophysics scheme, the prognostic cloud fraction and cloud/ice water content scheme produces a larger cloud fraction and more cloud/ice water content than the diagnostic scheme, mainly due to detrainment from moist convection (cloud source) that surpasses the effect of convective heating and drying (cloud sink). This affects temperature by influencing the radiative, convective, and microphysical processes. The experiment with combined modifications in cloud and precipitation schemes shows that interaction between modified moist convection and cloud macrophysics schemes results in more alleviation of the cold bias not only at the lower levels but also at the upper levels.",

            "abstract": "The formation of monoclinal right-lateral kink bands in Lake Edison granodiorite (central Sierra Nevada, CA) is investigated through field observations and mechanics based numerical modeling. Vertical faults act as weak surfaces within the granodiorite, and vertical granodiorite slabs bounded by closely-spaced faults curve into a kink. Leucocratic dikes are observed in association with kinking. Measurements were made on maps of Hilgard, Waterfall, Trail Fork, Kip Camp (Pollard and Segall, 1983b) and Bear Creek kink bands (Martel, 1998). Outcrop scale geometric parameters such as fault length andspacing, kink angle, and dike width are used to construct a representative geometry to be used in a finite element model. Three orders of fault were classified, length = 1.8, 7.2 and 28.8 m, and spacing = 0.3, 1.2 and 3.6 m, respectively.\nThe model faults are oriented at 25° to the direction of shortening (horizontal most compressive stress), consistent with measurements of wing crack orientations in the field area. The model also includes a vertical leucocratic dike, oriented perpendicular to the faults and with material properties consistent with aplite. Curvature of the deformed faults across the kink band was used to compare the effects of material properties, strain, and fault and dike geometry. Model results indicate that the presence of the dike, which provides a mechanical heterogeneity, is critical to kinking in these rocks. Keeping properties of the model granodiorite constant, curvature increased with decrease in yield strength and Young’s modulus of the dike. Curvature increased significantly as yield strength decreased from 95 to 90 MPa, and below this threshold value, limb rotation for the kink band was restricted to the dike. Changing Poisson’s ratio had no significant effect. The addition of small faults between bounding faults, decreasing fault spacing or increasing dike width increases the curvature. Increasing friction along the faults decreases slip, so the shortening is accommodated by more kinking. Analysis of these parameters also gives us an insight concerning the kilometer-scale kink band in the Mount Abbot Quadrangle, where the Rosy Finch Shear Zone may provide the mechanical heterogeneity that is necessary to cause kinking.",

            "abstract": "The Microwave Radiometer Technology Acceleration (MiRaTA) is a 3U CubeSat mission sponsored by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO). Microwave radiometer measurements and GPS radio occultation (GPSRO) measurements of all-weather temperature and humidity provide key contributions toward improved weather forecasting. The MiRaTA mission will validate new technologies in both passive microwave radiometry and GPS radio occultation: (1) new ultra-compact and low-power technology for multi-channel and multi-band passive microwave radiometers, and (2) new GPS receiver and patch antenna array technology for GPS radio occultation retrieval of both temperature-pressure profiles in the atmosphere and electron density profiles in the ionosphere. In addition, MiRaTA will test (3) a new approach to spaceborne microwave radiometer calibration using adjacent GPSRO measurements. The radiometer measurement quality can be substantially improved relative to present systems through the use of proximal GPSRO measurements as a calibration standard for radiometric observations, reducing and perhaps eliminating the need for costly and complex internal calibration targets. MiRaTA will execute occasional pitch-up maneuvers so that the radiometer and GPSRO observations sound overlapping volumes of atmosphere through the Earth's limb. To validate system performance, observations from both microwave radiometer (MWR) and GPSRO instruments will be compared to radiosondes, global high-resolution analysis fields, other satellite observations, and to each other using radiative transfer models. Both the radiometer and GPSRO payloads, currently at TRL5 but to be advanced to TRL7 at mission conclusion, can be accommodated in a single 3U CubeSat. The current plan is to launch from an International Space Station (ISS) orbit at ~400 km altitude and 52° inclination for low-cost validation over a ~90-day mission to fly in 2016. MiRaTA will demonstrate high fidelity, well-calibrated radiometric sensing from a nanosatellite platform, thereby enabling new architectural approaches for mission implementation at lower cost and risk with more flexible access to space.",

            "abstract": "Stomatal conductance (gs) is a key land surface attribute as it links transpiration, the dominant component of global land evapotranspiration and a key element of the global water cycle, and photosynthesis, the driving force of the global carbon cycle. Despite the pivotal role of gs in predictions of global water and carbon cycles, a global scale database and an associated globally applicable model of gs that allow predictions of stomatal behaviour are lacking. We present a unique database of globally distributed gs obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We employed a model of optimal stomatal conductance to assess differences in stomatal behaviour, and estimated the model slope coefficient, g1, which is directly related to the marginal carbon cost of water, for each dataset. We found that g1 varies considerably among PFTs, with evergreen savanna trees having the largest g1 (least conservative water use), followed by C3 grasses and crops, angiosperm trees, gymnosperm trees, and C4 grasses. Amongst angiosperm trees, species with higher wood density had a higher marginal carbon cost of water, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model. There was an interactive effect between temperature and moisture availability on g1: for wet environments, g1 was largest in high temperature environments, indicated by high mean annual temperature during the period when temperature above 0oC (Tm), but it did not vary with Tm across dry environments. We examine whether these differences in leaf-scale behaviour are reflected in ecosystem-scale differences in water-use efficiency. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of stomatal conductance across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of productivity and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of air pollution span from local to global, affecting human health, climate, visibility and ecosystems. Several actions at national, regional and global scale have been adopted to reduce pollutant emission levels. In our work we make use of the EDGAR_ v4.3 emission database to compare today’s pollutant levels with ex-post scenarios developed to assess the impact and effectiveness of legislation over the last 3 decades on air quality and climate. Differently from most of literature works addressing future air quality, here we focus on historical global anthropogenic emissions (years 1970-2010) of several gaseous and particulate air pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC) and past emission scenarios to demonstrate the role that policy has played in improving air quality. Three scenarios have been developed and compared to today’s situation (year 2010), assuming the lack of abatement measures, the complete stagnation of technology (no reduction measures applied and constant emission factors from 1970), and a constant fuel mixture (with a more prominent role for coal in the 1970s).\nSpecial focus is dedicated to the power generation sector, manufacturing industry and road transport activities since these were mostly influenced by official regulations in the EU. Global SO2 emissions from transport dropped down by 8.5 times due to the deployment of low S content fuels; NOx and CO emissions are indeed a function of combustion efficiency and therefore decreased with the introduction of new technologies, while NH3 emitted by road transport increased in Europe by 18% due to the introduction of catalyzers. Finally, particulate matter emissions are mainly abated by the installation of End-of-Pipe measures (e.g. filters) especially in the energy and transport sectors.",

            "abstract": "Interplanetary dust that originates from comets and asteroids may be in different stages of Solar System evolution. Atmosphereless planetary bodies, e.g., planetary satellites, asteroids, or Kuiper belt objects are enshrouded in clouds of dust released by meteoroid impacts or by volcanism. The ejecta grains are samples from the surface of these objects and their analysis can be performed from orbit or flyby to determine the surface composition, interior structure and ongoing geochemical processes. Early dust mass spectrometers on the Halley missions had sufficient mass resolution in order to provide important cosmochemical information in the near-comet high dust flux environment. The Ulysses dust detector discovered interstellar grains within the planetary system (Gruen et al. A&A, 1994) and its twin detector on Galileo discovered the tenuous dust clouds around the Galilean satellites (Krueger et al., Icarus, 2003). The similar-sized Cosmic Dust Analyzer onboard the Cassini mission combined a highly sensitive dust detector with a low-mass resolution mass spectrometer. Compositional dust measurements from this instrument probed the deep interior of Saturn's Enceladus satellite (Postberg et al., Nature, 2009). Based on this experience new instrumentation was developed that combined the best attributes of all these predecessors and exceeded their capabilities in accurate trajectory determination. The Hyperdust instrument is a combination of a Dust Trajectory Sensor (DTS) together with an analyzer for the chemical composition of dust particles in space. Dust particles' trajectories are determined by the measurement of induced electric signals. Large area chemical analyzers of 0.1 m2 sensitive area have been tested at a dust accelerator and it was demonstrated that they have sufficient mass resolution to resolve ions with atomic mass number >100. The Hyperdust instrument is capable of distinguishing interstellar and interplanetary grains based on their trajectory composition information. In orbit or flyby near airless planetary bodies the instrument can map the surface compositional down to a spatial resolution of ~10 km. The Hyperdust instrument is currently being developed to TRL 6 funded by NASA’s MatISSE program to be a low-mass, high performance instrument for future in-situ exploration.",

Coefficients of thermal expansion of pyrope-grossular garnets are in the range 2.10~ 2.74 x 10-5 K-1 and uniformly increase with temperature. Values for the two end members pyrope and grossular are identical within experimental error 2.74±0.05 x 10-5 K-1 and 2.73±0.01 x 10-5 K-1 respectively. Coefficients of thermal expansion for intermediate compositions are smaller than those of end members, and are not linearly dependent on composition. Bulk modulus of grossular is Κ0=164.3(1) GPa (with Κ0’ the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus fixed to 5.92) and bulk modulus of pyrope is Κ0=169.2(2) GPa (with Κ0’ fixed to 4.4) using a third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, which are consistent with previously reported values. The bulk moduli of garnets of intermediate composition are between ~155 and ~160 GPa, smaller than those of the end-members no matter which Κ0’ is chosen. The compositional dependence of bulk modulus resembles the compositional dependence of thermal expansion. Intermediate garnets on this binary have large positive excess volume, which makes them more compressible. We find that excess volumes in the pyrope-grossular series remain relatively large even at high pressure (~6GPa) and temperature (~800K), supporting the observation of crystal exsolution on this garnet join.

            "abstract": "Since 1900, around 90,000 people have lost their lives in 76 earthquakes occurred in Turkey, with a total affected population of ~7 million and direct estimated losses of ~25 billion USD. About half the lives lost were due to two earthquakes associated with the North Anatolian Fault in 1939 and 1999. During this time, seven large westward-migrating earthquakes created a 900-km-long continuous surface rupture along the fault zone from Erzincan to the Marmara Sea, stopping just short of Istanbul. Based on a time-dependent model that includes coseismic and postseismic effects of the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake with moment magnitude (Mw) = 7.4, Parsons concluded that the probability of an earthquake with Mw >7 in the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul is 35% to 70% in the next 30 years. This high probability is shared by Tokyo and San Francisco; however, the earthquake fragility of the pre-2000 building stock in Turkey is much higher than that of California or Japan. (Erdik, 2013). All of the arguments described above provide a sound basis for a Japanese-Turkish partnership enabling each partner to share experiences gained from past destructive earthquakes and prepare for expected large earthquakes. The SATREPS project aims to address this need, also focusing on the tsunami hazard. The project’s main objectives are i) to develop disaster mitigation policies and strategies based on multidisciplinary research activities; ii) to provide decision makers with newly found knowledge for its implementation to the current regulations; iii) to organize disaster education programs in order to increase disaster awareness in Turkey; iv) to contribute the evaluation of active fault studies in Japan.

            "abstract": "Rise of atmospheric oxygen in the Paleoproterozoic has been long recognized as a unidirectional, stepwise oxidation event. However, recent geochemical studies have reported the occurrences of deep-water oxygenation and sulfate accumulation in the Paleoproterozoic oceans [e.g., 1], suggesting that the oxidation was a dynamic transition associated with an overshoot of oxygen (so called, ‘the Great Oxygen Transition’ or GOT) [2]. During the GOT, the oxygen levels might have achieved 0.1-1 Present Atmospheric Level (PAL) over ~108 years [2]. Such an intense long-term oxygen overshoot appears to require some specific mechanism and strong oxidative forcing as a trigger. In this study, we provide the first numerical model that is capable of explaining the dynamics of the atmospheric oxygen during the GOT. We focus on a climate jump at the end of the Paleoproterozoic snowball glaciation as a trigger, and constrain the magnitude and duration of the snowball-induced oxygenation by using a biogeochemical cycle model.\nThe results show that super greenhouse condition after the glaciation causes an increase in nutrient input from the continent to the oceans, which lead to a high rate of organic carbon burial in the oceans. This triggers a rapid jump in oxygen levels from low (<10-5 PAL) to high (~0.01 PAL) steady states within <104 years after deglaciation. The jump in oxygen levels is followed by the massive deposition of carbonate minerals, which corresponds to the “cap-carbonates”. The elevated rate of organic carbon burial is prolonged over ~106 years, which results in an overshoot of atmospheric oxygen by up to ~0.1-1 PAL. The overshoot lasts for ~107-108 years because net consumption of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere does not proceed efficiently. Such an extensive overshoot causes the oxygenation of the deep-water, and lead to the accumulation of sulfate ions by up to 1-10 mM and the deposition of sulfate minerals in the oceans. These results are in good agreement with the geological and geochemical data in the Paleoproterozoic [2, 3], implying that the Paleoproterozoic snowball glaciation would have been a sufficiently strong forcing to trigger the GOT.\n[1] Canfield et al. 2013, Pros.

            "abstract": "Networked high frequency hydrologic and water quality measurements needed to investigate physical and biogeochemical processes at the watershed scale and create robust models are limited and lacking standardization. Determining the drivers and mechanisms of ecological changes in aquatic systems in response to natural and anthropogenic pressures is challenging due to the large amounts of terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric, biological, chemical, and physical data it requires at varied spatiotemporal scales. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale infrastructure project designed to provide data to address the impacts of climate change, land-use, and invasive species on ecosystem structure and function. Using a combination of standardized continuous in situ measurements and observational sampling, the NEON Aquatic array will produce over 200 data products across its spatially-distributed field sites for 30 years to facilitate spatiotemporal analysis of the drivers of ecosystem change. Three NEON sites in Alabama were chosen to address linkages between watershed-scale processes and ecosystem changes along an eco-hydrological gradient within the Tombigbee River Basin. The NEON Aquatic design, once deployed, will include continuous measurements of surface water physical, chemical, and biological parameters, groundwater level, temperature and conductivity and local meteorology. Observational sampling will include bathymetry, water chemistry and isotopes, and a suite of organismal sampling from microbes to macroinvertebrates to vertebrates. NEON deployed a buoy to measure the temperature profile of the Black Warrior River from July – November, 2013 to determine the spatiotemporal variability across the water column from a daily to seasonal scale. In July 2014 a series of water quality profiles were performed to assess the contribution of physical and biogeochemical drivers over a diurnal cycle. Additional river transects were performed across our site reach to capture the spatial variability of surface water parameters. Our preliminary data show differing response times to precipitation events and diurnal processes informing our infrastructure designs and sampling protocols aimed at providing data to address the eco-hydrological gradient.",

            "abstract": "The late Quaternary history of the Red Sea is characterized by sharp increases in sea surface salinity during glacial maxima in response to global sea level drop. These imposed an extremely weak current exchange between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean through the Bab-el-Mandeb Straits that resulted in temporal changes in stratification, productivity and subsurface oxygenation of the Red Sea. The combined effect of these perturbations has been interpreted to impose extended aplanktonic zones in Red Sea sediments centered at glacial maxima. Yet the dynamics of the transition between glacial and interglacial stages in the Red Sea are still not well understood.\nHere, we present evidence for the occurrence of a strong anoxic episode during the penultimate transition from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS5 (Termination II) based on uranium concentrations, isotopic ratios, and organic carbon concentrations (Corg) studied in core KL23 taken by R/V Meteor from northern Red Sea (24o44.88’N 35o03.28’E) at 702 m water depth.\n(234U/238U) activity ratios and U concentrations start rising from their MIS6 levels (~1 and 1.9 ppm, respectively) ca. 140 ka, and peak at 135-132 ka (1.08 and 3.1 ppm). These patterns are matched by changes in Corg, and the onset of all slightly precedes sea level rise patterns. Thereafter, uranium and Corg decrease sharply, reaching minima that characterizes the rest of MIS5e, ca. 130 ka. Uranium activity ratios however, decrease gradually from their deglacial peak to a minimum value (~0.94) at 122 ka. In view of the redox sensitive behavior of U, the buildup of U concentrations would support anoxic conditions, rather than a rise in export production, as the most likely explanation for the preservation of Corg in the sediments. Yet, the high (234U/238U) values that imply a dominance of open seawater U in the samples, together with d13C values of foraminifera bracketing the studied interval that display a depletion trend indicating an increase in primary production, both suggest that an increase in export production cannot be ruled out as the source of high Corg in the sediments. We will evaluate the possibility of an increase in export production that is coeval with the aplanktonic zone in this core in the context of 230Th excess data, sea level changes and paleo-circulation of the Red Sea.",

            "abstract": "In areas where regional strain is accommodated by broad zones of short and low slip-rate faults, geomorphic and paleoseismic characterization of faults is difficult because of poor surface expression and long earthquake recurrence intervals. In humid areas, faults can be buried by thick sediments and undetectable until the next earthquake. In Java, despite the frequency of damaging shallow earthquakes, active faults are diffuse and their characterization is challenging. Among them is the ENE-trending Cimandiri fault. Cumulative displacement along the fault produces prominent ENE-oriented ranges with the east side moving relatively upward and to the north. Along its length, the few hundred meter wide fault zone is expressed in the bedrock by numerous NE, E and NW-trending thrust- and strike slip faults and folds. However, it is unclear which of these structures are active, as the diffuse nature of the fault zone has so far stymied conventional paleoseismic study. To address this, we performed a tectonic geomorphology analysis of the fault zone. We used the 30-m resolution SRTM-DEM to construct longitudinal profiles of 601 bedrock rivers along the ranges and calculated the normalized channel steepness index (ksn). Our preliminary results rely on the assumption that ksn is a reasonable proxy for relative rock uplift rate in a region, assuming variations in rock type and climate are insignificant. While the active traces of the Cimandiri fault are obscured, the spatial variation in ksn allows us to delineate 4 discontinuous hanging wall blocks that vary between E and NE striking along the zone. The largest ksn values are along the central-western block (Cibeber area). The longest block is in the central eastern portion of the fault zone and comprises 45 km of the 100 km long fault zone. The fault bifurcates at its eastern termination and steps into the Lembang fault. The distribution of ksn suggests that reverse motion is more dominant than lateral because of a lack of kinematically consistent deformation associated with the steps along the fault zone. This geometric characterization of the active Cimandiri fault implies a maximum magnitude along its 100 km length of M7.5 but its geometric complexity suggests greater segmentation and smaller events—consistent with the limited historical record of upper plate earthquakes in Java.",

The Newcastle area, situated on the southern margin of the Dublin Basin, exhibits elevated geothermal gradient (>30 °C/km) in the exploratory boreholes drilled by GT Energy.\nThe MT soundings were carried out in the highly urbanized Dublin suburb and are heavily noise-contaminated and distorted due to EM noise from nearby industry and the DC tram system. Processing the “quietest” 4-hour night time subsets of data using several robust codes and the ELICIT method we obtained reliable and interpretable MT impedance and geomagnetic transfer functions at most sites.\nTensor decomposition was applied at each site to ascertain if the data are suitable for 2D modelling and to determine the appropriate geoelectric strike direction. The final 2-D models underwent examination using a new stability technique, and the final two 2-D profiles with reliability estimations, expressed through conductance and resistivity, were derived.\n3-D models of all MT data in the Newcastle area have also been determined. The 3-D models exhibit higher conductive structures in comparison to the 2-D models, with similarly resistive background rocks. The shallow conductive structures, to the depth of 1 km, have north-south elongation correlated with surface traces of faults, which are perpendicular to the regional Blackrock to Newcastle Fault (BNF). Deeper structures become more oriented to regional geoelectric strike similar to 2-D regional strike.\nThe 2-D and 3-D modeling reveal that the BNF is imaged as a conductive zone to depths of 4 km and is likely highly fractured. Generally, the area south of the BNF is more resistive and compact with a horizontal conductive layer at approximately 1 km depth and with a very thin surficial sedimentary layer. In contrast, the structures north of the BNF are more heterogeneous, with deeper conductive layers (2-3 km depth) and thicker (several hundred meters) sedimentary layers above.\nThe deeper conductive layers are interpreted as water bearing or geothermal fluids and estimated porosity and permeability indicates potential to deliver warm water to the surface.",

            "abstract": "APHORISM project proposes the development and testing of two new methods to combine Earth Observation satellite data from different sensors, and ground data. The aim is to demonstrate that this two types of data, appropriately managed and integrated, can provide new improved GMES products useful for seismic and volcanic crisis management.\nThe first method, APE – A Priori information for Earthquake damage mapping, concerns the generation of maps to address the detection and estimate of damage caused by a seism. The use of satellite data to investigate earthquake damages is not an innovative issue. We can find a wide literature and projects concerning such issue, but usually the approach is only based on change detection techniques and classifications algorithms. The novelty of APE relies on the exploitation of a priori information derived by InSAR time series to measure surface movements, shake maps obtained from seismological data, and vulnerability information. This a priori information is then integrated with change detection map to improve accuracy and to limit false alarms.\nThe second method deals with volcanic crisis management. The method, MACE - Multi-platform volcanic Ash Cloud Estimation, concerns the exploitation of GEO (Geosynchronous Earth Orbit) sensor platform, LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite sensors and ground measures to improve the ash detection and retrieval and to characterize the volcanic ash clouds. The basic idea of MACE consists of an improvement of volcanic ash retrievals at the space–time scale by using both the LEO and GEO estimations and in-situ data. Indeed the standard ash thermal infrared retrieval is integrated with data coming from a wider spectral range from visible to microwave. The ash detection is also extended in case of cloudy atmosphere or steam plumes.\nAPE and MACE methods have been defined in order to provide products oriented toward the next ESA Sentinels satellite missions.\nThe project is funded under the European Union FP7 program and the Kick-Off meeting has been held at INGV premises in Rome on 18th December 2013.",

In the absence of long-term instrumental data, multi-proxy (testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, δ13C, δ18O and δD) palaeoclimatic records from south Patagonian peatlands can provide valuable information about the long-term variability of the southern westerlies, a key component in determining the Southern Ocean’s function as a sink or source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Similarly, multi-proxy palaeoclimatic reconstructions from moss banks provide a unique terrestrial palaeoenvironmental archive from the Antarctic Peninsula, where records of past ecological change are rare and provide vital context for the recent, rapid biotic change recorded since the mid-20th century.\nRobust chronologies are imperative for the accurate examination of spatial and temporal patterns in Holocene climate variation. Previous work has confirmed the presence of discrete tephra horizons in south Patagonian peatlands and Antarctic Peninsula moss banks but the examination of distal, cryptotephras is currently underemployed as a geochronological tool. The chronological potential of these archives is considerable, given their high and largely continuous accumulation rates and suitability for 14C dating, presenting additional opportunities to refine the ages of major Holocene eruptions. Here, we present initial tephrostratigraphic results from both regions and explore the links between them.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), elongated structures of high values of water vapor flux carried along the warm conveyor belt of extratropical cyclones, are a prominent feature in the poleward transport of moisture, and are often associated to extreme precipitation events (EPEs). Here we examine the link between EPEs on the Atlantic Margin of the Iberian Peninsula and ARs in the period 1979-2007, and show that for about 75% of cases there is a direct relation, and for many others, a second order or indirect connection; that is, they originate from moisture transported by an AR to a neighboring region the previous days that feeds another cyclone causing the actual event. EPEs in western Iberia present a pronounced seasonal cycle, being much more likely to occur in the autumn and practically inexistent in the summer. The incidence of ARs is however much higher and doesn’t show the same temporal frequency as EPEs, with a maximum in winter and a minimum, very marked in the south but not so much in the north, in summer. Only about 30% of ARs result in EPEs in autumn-winter and less than 10% in summer, likely due to differences in forcing, duration and thermodynamic characteristics of the ARs themselves. The interannual variability of EPEs and ARs can be quite large and uncorrelated, with years of high AR activity not necessarily years with high number of EPEs; nevertheless, EPEs are consistently linked to ARs.\nThe interannual variability of AR arrivals to the Iberian Peninsula mirrors that of AR activity in the southeast North Atlantic and it’s enhanced by negative NAO conditions. There are uncorrelated and important yearly variations in other quadrants of the North Atlantic, some being favored over others depending on persistent circulation anomalies. For periods of several years the entire North Atlantic can also present a significant amount of interannual variability in AR activity.",

            "abstract": "Using high-resolution optical satellite imagery, and a 3-10 m resolution digital elevation model derived from declassified CORONA imagery, we mapped the trace of the central Sagaing fault and associated geomorphic features along the western flank of the Sagaing Hills. This approximately 350-km-long stretch of the Sagaing fault, which slips at about 2 cm/yr, lies only ~ 10 km west of the densely populated city of Mandalay. Much of this stretch of the fault has not produced a major earthquake (M > 7+) for over one century, and therefore is one of the potentially most dangerous seismic sources in SE Asia.\nOur new geomorphic mapping reveals more complex deformation patterns along the western side of the Sagaing Hills than hitherto pictured on published maps. The CORONA DEM shows clear evidence of on-going dextral transpression along the fault, consistent with the minor shortening component revealed by GPS (e.g., Socquet et al., 2006). Several hundreds of meters long, right-stepping step-overs characterize the fault north of the well-known Yega-In pull-part basin/lake, forming a series of overlapping dextral scarps at the surface.\nOur preliminary field and remote sensing observations suggest that the 1839 Ava earthquake, which may be the latest, largest destructive event along this section of the fault, was a great earthquake. We found minimum right-lateral displacements of about 5 to 7 meters. Such large amounts of plausibly single event co-seismic offsets suggest that the Mw magnitude of the 1839 earthquake may have ranged between 7.4 to 8+, which could scale with up to 300+ km rupture length (e.g., Biasi and Weldon, 2006) along the central Sagaing fault seismic gap, between Sagaing and Naypyidaw.",

We compare results derived from observed wave power with those from statistical characterisations based on geomagnetic indices such as Kp through the course of the main and recovery phases of storm-time Van Allen radiation belt dynamics. We find using the observed ULF wave power presents a remarkable explanation for the overall dynamics of the belts in terms of the impacts of inward and outward radial diffusion in association with plasmasheet sources and magnetopause shadowing. At ultra-relativistic energies the resulting dynamics demonstrate a remarkable simplicity which is controlled by the ULF wave power. ULF wave power can explain all of the morphologies of the Van Allen belts at ultra-relativistic energies in the form of either one, two or three belts. Overall, our results reveal that ULF waves truly provide an explanation for the 1,2,3 of ultra-relativistic radiation belt dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The southern Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) of northwestern California exhibits northeast-directed contraction, transitioning to north-northwest directed translation within the broad San Andreas fault (SAF) transform margin to the south. The Little Salmon fault (LSF) is one of the southern-most, active thrust faults within the onshore fold and thrust belt of the CSZ, and lies proximal to the transition from compressional to dextral stress across the Mendocino Triple Junction. Thus, it is an ideal location to characterize strain associated with this complex region of transitional stress regimes. High precision topographic data (LiDAR) enabled detailed mapping of geomorphic features that would otherwise be obscured by dense vegetation of the area. A northwest trending lineament, sub-parallel and south of the main splay of the LSF is observed on LiDAR imagery. The lineament exhibits potential up-to-the-northeast offset and traverses several Van Duzen river terrace risers and treads that range from Pleistocene to potentially Holocene in age. A shallow, exploratory trench was hand-excavated across the lineament. The shallow, roughly 1.5 m-deep, 16 m-long trench exposed imbricated gravels that dip into the base of the trench in the upper end. Coring within the lower end of the trench mapped the southern extent of the gravels. The architecture of the unconsolidated, clast-supported gravel deposit displays a diffuse up-to-the-northeast step. More obvious offset may be expressed at lower depths and/or in mediums with more confining stress. The linear map expression of the lineament across relatively steep terrain suggests that the fault may be relatively steeply dipping. Conjugate deformation shear bands within Neogene bedrock nearby along the Van Duzen river provide additional information about the state of stress within this area of transition.",

            "abstract": "South Korea separates two mantle source domains for late Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in East Asia: depleted mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) mantle–enriched mantle type 1 (DMM-EM1) in the north and DMM-EM2 in the south. We determined geochemical compositions, including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopes for the Jeongok trachybasalts (~0.51 to 0.15 Ma K–Ar ages) from northernmost South Korea, to better constrain the origin and distribution of the enriched mantle components. The Jeongok basalts exhibit light rare earth element (LREE)-enriched patterns ([La/Yb]N = 9.2–11.6). The (La/Yb)N ratios are lower than that of typical oceanic island basalt (OIB). On a primitive mantle-normalized incompatible element plot, the Jeongok samples show OIB-like enrichment in highly incompatible elements. However, they are depleted in moderately incompatible elements (e.g., La, Nd, Zr, Hf, etc.) compared with the OIB and exhibit positive anomalies in K and Pb. These anomalies are also prime characteristics of the Wudalianchi basalts, extreme EM1 end-member volcanics in northeast China. We have compared the geochemistry of the Jeongok basalts with those of available Late Cenozoic intraplate volcanic rocks from East Asia (from north to south, Wudalianchi, Mt. Baekdu and Baengnyeong for DMM-EM1, and Jeju for DMM-EM2). The mantle source for the Jeongok volcanics contains an EM1 component. The contribution of the EM1 component to East Asian volcanism increases toward the north, from Baengnyeong through Jeongok to Mt. Baekdu and finally to Wudalianchi. Modeling of trace element data suggests that the Jeongok basalts may have been generated by mixing of a Wudalianchi-like melt (EM1 end-member) and a melt that originated from a depleted mantle source, with some addition of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Jeongok area. In Nd–Hf isotope space, the most enriched EM1-component-bearing Jeongok sample shows elevation of 176Hf/177Hf at a given 143Nd/144Nd compared with OIB. Recycled pelagic sediments may explain the EM1-end-member component of northeastern Asian volcanism, possibly from the mantle transition zone.",

These results are obtained by means of simultaneous real-time measurements of the real contact area and all components of the strain tensor along a long, spatially extended interface, when a material contrast of approximately 20-30% is imposed. A number of qualitatively different rupture fronts are observed. The rupture velocities selected by the system and the rupture form highly depend on the rupture direction relative to the slip direction. We will present detailed measurements of the structure of these different rupture fronts and provide a quantitative comparison to rupture front measurements performed on a homogeneous (no material contrast) interface.

            "abstract": "For more than 12 years we have been conducting a continuous monitoring of downhole pore pressures at multiple sub-bottom intervals in ODP Holes 808I and 1173B situated landward and seaward of the deformation front in the Nankai Trough off Cape Muroto. We found that the pressure response to the semi-diurnal ocean tide (M2), both amplitude and phase, gradually changed during the observed period. The M2 amplitudes at most depths in Hole 808I decay as their phase delay (up to 45 degrees), only if the amplitude is larger than ~0.2 of that for the seafloor. On the other hand, we observe an anomalous phase lead (up to -40 degrees) if the relative amplitude is smaller than ~0.2. We hypothesize that the recorded pore pressure is a combination of two components; one with larger amplitudes and phase-delay and the other with small amplitude and phase-lead. The former is interpreted to be caused by a direct communication between sensors and the seafloor through the space of the annulus. It gradually attenuated by the decrease in hydraulic diffusivity around the sensors, as the annulus space is packed off by a gradual collapsing of the formation. After that, we hypothesize that the sensor is in good mechanical/hydrological contact with the formation, and that the latter variation is identical or close to that of formation pressure variation. The mechanism of the latter variation remains enigmatic, but a feasible explanation is the existence of a layer, next to the sensor, with the contrast in fluid bulk modulus, frame bulk modulus, or permeability (Wang and Davis, 1996). At Site 808, numerous small fractures were detected in cores/logs, which can generate such contrast in bulk modulus or permeability. Other causes, such as solid earth tide or thermal expansion/contraction caused by a tidally-induced flow within the casing cannot explain both the amplitude and phase simultaneously. We propose that a tidal response signal can be used to detect local fracture zones or gas-rich layers.",

            "abstract": "The Imager of Sprite and Upper Atmosphere Lightning (ISUAL) onboard the Taiwanese satellite Formosat-2 has continuously observed transient luminous events (TLEs) within the +/-60 degree range of latitude for a decade since May 2004. The lightning electromagnetic pulse is responsible for Elves , the dominate TLE type which accounts for approximately 80% of the total TLE count according to the ISUAL global survey. By analyzing the limb-viewed images with a wavelength filter of 622.8-754nm, 72% of elves are found to be ‘glued’ to the OH Meinel band (~630nm) nightglow layer within its thickness of 8km, with the OH layer normally at an altitude of 87 km (Huang et al., 2010).This collocation of elves and airglow layer is frequently dismissed as coincidence, since the physical mechanisms for the formation of the two optical phenomena are macroscopically quite different. However, a common ingredient in the atmospheric chemistry is monatomic oxygen. O is needed to make O3 and ultimately hydroxyl OH, the main radiative species of the airglow layer. O is also needed to form nitric oxide NO, the species with the lowest known ionization potential (9.26 eV) in the D-region. Thomas (1990) has documented steep increases in O concentration in the 83-85 km altitude range and Hale (1985) has found steep increases in electrical conductivity in the 84-85 km range, both with rocket measurements. A great simplification of the nighttime ionosphere is the presence of a single photon energy—10.2 eV—Lyman-α, originating in monatomic H in the Earth’s geocorona. A simple Chapman layer calculation for the altitude of maximum photo-dissociation of O2, using the measured absorption cross-section of O2 at the Lyman-α energy, shows an altitude of maximum O production at 85 km. Elve emission in the nitrogen first positive band is enhanced by the presence of free electrons from ionized NO, but too large a conductivity will lead to the exclusion of the radiation field from the lightning return stroke and suppress the elve emission.. These comparisons of marked changes in key quantities over a narrow range of special altitudes lend support to O being the main player in linking electrical and optical behavior in elve emission.",

In this study the relationship between climate model biases in the control climate and the simulated climate sensitivity are discussed on the basis of perturbed physics ensemble simulations with a globally resolved energy balance (GREB) model. It is illustrated that the uncertainties in the simulated climate sensitivity can be conceptually split into two parts: a direct effect of the perturbed physics on the climate sensitivity independent of the control mean climate and an indirect effect of the perturbed physics by changing the control mean climate, which in turn changes the climate sensitivity, as the climate sensitivity itself is depending on the control climate. It is discussed whether correcting the models by tuning or by artificially correcting the control mean state (flux correcting) would be a better way of improving the climate change predictions.",

This limitation is particularly clear for tropical forests, despite the risk of drought to these ecosystems during the coming decades. We present new findings from the only current long-term 'ecosystem-scale' (1 ha) rainfall manipulation experiment in tropical rainforest, the Esecaflor experiment at Caxiuana National Forest, Para State, Brazil. Throughfall has been partially excluded from experimental forest at the Esecaflor experiment for more than a decade. We have previously demonstrated a capacity to model short-term physiological responses well, but longer term physiology and ecological dynamics remain challenging to understand and represent. In particular, high mortality and increased autotrophic respiration following extended drought are poorly understood phenomena, and their interaction with hydraulic responses and limitations needs to be characterised. We present initial data that for the first time combine carbon use and hydraulic metrics, comparing drought-vulnerable and non-vulnerable species that have experienced extended soil moisture deficit, as imposed in the experiment, also considering the response in soil respiration. We also discuss how these findings can be used to develop future empirical and modelling studies aimed at improving our capacity to predict the effects of drought on tropical forest ecosystems in Amazonia and in other tropical forest regions where species characteristics and environmental constraints may influence both short and long-term responses to drought.",

            "abstract": "We have acquired and processed new aeromagnetic data that covers the entire Norway Basin oceanic spreading system located between the Møre volcanic rifted margin and its (intermediate) conjugate system, the Jan Mayen microcontinent (JMMC). The new compilation allows us to revisit its entire structure and spreading evolution from the Early Eocene breakup to the Late Oligocene abortion of the Aegir Ridge. We here discuss the dynamics of conjugate volcanic (rifted) margin formation and reconstruct the subsequent spreading evolution of the Norway Basin until its abortion. We have estimated a new set of Euler poles of rotation for the Norway Basin derived from more than 88,000 km of new magnetic profiles. The new compilation confirms that a fan-shaped spreading evolution of the Norway Basin was particularly active before the cessation of seafloor spreading and abortion of the Aegir Ridge. The Norway Basin shows a more complex system of micro-plates and asymmetric segments locally affected by episodic ridge jumps. The new observations have implications for the syn- and post-breakup stratigraphic and rifted-margin tectonic development of the JMMC and its conjugate margins. In particular, an important Mid-Eocene geodynamic event at around magnetic chron C21r is recognized in the Norway Basin. This event coincides with the onset of diking and rifting between the proto-JMMC and the East Greenland margin, leading to a second phase of breakup in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea ~26 My later in the Oligocene. Restored in its pre-breakup configuration, the new surveys also allow us to discuss further the tectonic and crustal evolution of the conjugate volcanic rifted margins and associated transform and oblique segments. The applicability of magma-poor concepts, off Norway, for example, remains questionable for us. The significant amount of breakup magmatism, the huge amount of pre-breakup sag sedimentation and the presence of thinned and preserved continental crust without the systematic occurrence of underlying and/or exhumed serpentinised terranes. The mid-Norwegian volcanic rifted margins appear quite different from the Iberian type, magma-poor margin, even if the processes leading to the early (and aborted) thinning events seems to be similar to some extent.",

            "abstract": "We have completed high resolution geological mapping of impact melt deposits at the young lunar complex craters (<1 billion years) Copernicus, Jackson and Tycho using data from recent missions. Crater floors being the largest repository of impact melt, we have mapped their morphological diversity expressed in terms of varied surface texture, albedo, character and occurrence of boulder units as well as relative differences in floor elevation. Examples of wall and rim impact melt units and their relation to floor units have also been mapped. Among the distinctive features of these impact melt deposits are: 1) Impact Melt Wave Fronts: These are extensive (sometimes several kilometers in length) and we have documented their occurrence and distribution in different parts of the crater floor at Jackson and Tycho. These features emphasize melt mobility and style of emplacement during the modification stage of the craters. 2) Variations in Floor Elevations: Spatially extensive and coherent sections of crater floors have different elevations at all the three craters. The observed elevation differences could be caused by subsidence due to cooling of melt and/or structural failure, together with a contribution from regional slope. 3) Melt-Covered Megablocks: We also observe large blocks/rock-fragments (megablocks) covered in impact melt, which could be sections of collapsed wall or in some cases, subdued sections of central peaks. 4) Melt-Covered Central Peaks: Impact melt has also been mapped on the central peaks but varies in spatial extent among the craters. The presence of melt on peaks must be taken into account when interpreting peak mineralogy as exposures of deeper crust. 5) Boulder Distribution: Interesting trends are observed in the distribution of boulder units of various sizes; some impact melt units have spatially extensive boulders, while boulder distribution is very scarce in other units on the floor. We interpret these distributions to be influenced by a) the differential collapse of the crater walls during the modification stage, and b) the amount of relative melt volume retained in different parts of the crater floor. These observations provide important documentation of the morphological diversity and better understanding of the emplacement and final distribution of impact melt deposits.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen isotope ratios of plant leaf waxes are increasingly used as a proxy for past hydrologic variability. However, a number of environmental variables influence the net fractionation between leaf waxes and the environmental water from which their hydrogen is ultimately derived. Salinity effects are of particular importance in coastal tropical and subtropical settings, where deuterium discrimination increases by 1.5‰ per salinity unit in the leaf wax n-alkanes of the grey mangrove, Avicennia marina. It is not possible to tell whether sedimentary n-alkanes are from mangrove plants, or from terrestrial plants that are not exposed to salt water. The salinity component of hydrogen isotope fractionation therefore complicates leaf wax hydrogen isotopes in most tropical coastal marine and lacustrine settings. However, a strong relationship between salinity and a more specific mangrove lipid biomarker could provide the basis for a paleosalinity and water isotope proxy in low-latitude coastal environments.\nHere we present results from a calibration study of Rhizophora spp. (red mangroves) growing on the Micronesian islands of Pohnpei and Palau, using taraxerol, a biomarker that is largely specific to this genus in these settings. We observed an increase in net deuterium discrimination between surface water and taraxerol of 1.2‰ per salinity unit. We investigated potential mechanisms for this increase at high salinity by measuring the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf and xylem water from Rhizophora spp. Contrary to most terrestrial plants, xylem water in these trees is depleted relative to surface water, with greater relative depletion at higher salinities. This could be the result of increased deuterium discrimination during water uptake, as a greater percentage of salt is excluded by roots at higher salinity. Alternatively, it could indicate that some of the water in the xylem is from relatively depleted freshwater (rain and or dew) that enters the plant through the leaves, and that this source becomes increasingly important at higher salinities. We also observed decreased leaf water enrichment relative to xylem water at higher salinity, which is consistent with foliar uptake of fresh water for mangroves growing in saline conditions.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust fertilization of Southern Ocean surface waters, and mixing with Antarctic deep-water, influences oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and draws down global atmospheric CO2concentration during glacial periods. Quantifying modern variability in dust source and transport strength, especially with respect to high- and low-latitude climate phenomena (e.g. SAM, ENSO), will improve understanding of this important aspect of the global carbon cycle.\nHere we present data from a new intermediate-depth, coastal ice core drilled at Roosevelt Island, Antarctica as part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project. Using HySPLIT forward trajectories, climate reanalysis and geochemistry data, this work explores variability in atmospheric transport for modern Southern Hemisphere dust source areas (primarily Australia, southern South America and southern Africa). While New Zealand represents a relatively small dust source at present, it is strongly-connected to the Antarctic due to its position within the circumpolar westerly winds and was a major dust source during the last glacial period. Geochemical data from the RICE ice core (79.36ºS, 161.71ºW, 550 m a.s.l.) are used to constrain sources of dust in this sector. The lanthanide elements—common in crustal material and not susceptible to fractionation—can preserve the signature of their original source material, allowing for characterisation of dust provenance. Initial results suggest that only air trajectories originating in New Zealand regularly reach the Ross Sea, Marie Byrd Land and Roosevelt Island within 3 to 5 days (see Figure 1), a characteristic travel time of suspended dust particles. We discuss estimates of the relative source strength of New Zealand compared with other dust source areas to evaluate its overall contribution.\nFigure 1: Daily 96-hour forward trajectories for Southern Hemisphere dust source areas, 2010-2013 (NOAA HySPLIT, NCEP reanalysis).

            "abstract": "We present the new Tsunami.gov website, which delivers a single authoritative source of tsunami information for the public and emergency management communities. The site efficiently merges information from NOAA’s Tsunami Warning Centers (TWC’s) by way of a comprehensive XML feed called Tsunami Event XML (TEX). The resulting unified view allows users to quickly see the latest tsunami alert status in geographic context without having to understand complex TWC areas of responsibility. The new site provides for the creation of a wide range of products beyond the traditional ASCII-based tsunami messages. The publication of modern formats such as Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) can drive geographically aware emergency alert systems like FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS). Supported are other popular information delivery systems, including email, text messaging, and social media updates. The Tsunami.gov portal allows NOAA staff to easily edit content and provides the facility for users to customize their viewing experience. In addition to access by the public, emergency managers and government officials may be offered the capability to log into the portal for special access rights to decision-making and administrative resources relevant to their respective tsunami warning systems. The site follows modern HTML5 responsive design practices for optimized use on mobile as well as non-mobile platforms. It meets all federal security and accessibility standards. Moving forward, we hope to expand Tsunami.gov to encompass tsunami-related content currently offered on separate websites, including the NOAA Tsunami Website, National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, National Geophysical Data Center’s Tsunami Database, and National Data Buoy Center’s DART Program. This project is part of the larger Tsunami Information Technology Modernization Project, which is consolidating the software architectures of NOAA’s existing TWC’s into a single system. We welcome your feedback to help Tsunami.gov become an effective public resource for tsunami information and a medium to enable better global tsunami warning coordination.",

            "abstract": "Modelling subsurface structures is mainly performed in under-constrained contexts as only sparse and indirect data are available. Stochastic modelling is the common strategy to solve such problems, especially since such subsurface 3D models serve as support for quantitative studies (e.g.: reservoir characterizations, etc.). Multiple 3D models are generated from the dataset and represent a sampling of plausible subsurface structure representations. From this model sampling, statistical analysis on targeted parameters (e.g.: reserve estimations, flow behaviours, etc.) and a posteriori uncertainties are performed to assess risks. However, on one hand, uncertainties may be huge, which requires many models to be generated for scanning the space of possibilities. On the other hand, some computations performed on the generated models are time consuming and cannot, in practice, be applied on all of them. This issue is particularly critical in CO2 storage studies as many scales of investigations are required, from meter to regional ones, to estimate storage capacities and associated risks. Recent petroleum studies propose to define distances between models to allow sophisticated multivariate statistics to be applied on the space of uncertainties so that only sub-samples, representative of initial set, are investigated for dynamic time-consuming studies. In this work, it is proposed to define such distances in the particular case of CO2 storage as differences exist between the petroleum and CO2 storage dynamic behaviours and problematic. Moreover, particular interests are also paid to the characterization of the topology of the reservoir rocks. The skeleton of the reservoir rock is studied through graph spectral analysis and topological indices. A synthetic data set of fluvial models with different geological characteristics was generated and studied using the defined distance. Relationships between model settings and distances are shown and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative modeling of flow and transport through fractured geological media is challenging due to the inaccessibility of the underlying medium properties and the complex interplay between heterogeneity and small scale transport processes such as heterogeneous advection, matrix diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption. This complex interplay leads to anomalous (non-Fickian) transport behavior, the origin of which remains a matter of debate: whether it arises from variability in fracture permeability (velocity heterogeneity), connectedness in the fracture network (velocity correlation), or interaction between fractures and matrix. Here we show that this uncertainty of heterogeneity- vs. correlation-controlled transport can be resolved by combining convergent and push-pull tracer tests because flow reversibility is strongly dependent on correlation, whereas late-time scaling of breakthrough curves is mainly controlled by heterogeneity. We build on this insight, and propose a Lagrangian statistical model that takes the form of a continuous time random walk (CTRW) with correlated particle velocities. In this framework, flow heterogeneity and flow correlation are quantified by a Markov process of particle transition times that is characterized by a distribution function and a transition probability. Our transport model captures the anomalous behavior in the breakthrough curves for both push-pull and convergent flow geometries, with the same set of parameters. We validate our model in the Ploemeur observatory in France. Thus, the proposed correlated CTRW modeling approach provides a simple yet powerful framework for characterizing the impact of flow correlation and heterogeneity on transport in fractured media.",

            "abstract": "Climate projections depend on scenarios of fossil fuel emissions and land use change, and the IPCC AR5 parallel process assumes consistent climate scenarios across Integrated Assessment and Earth System Models (IAMs and ESMs). The CMIP5 project used a novel “land use harmonization” based on the Global Land use Model (GLM) to provide ESMs with consistent 1500-2100 land use trajectories generated by historical data and four IAM projections. A direct coupling of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), GLM, and the Community ESM (CESM) has allowed us to characterize and partially address a major gap in the CMIP5 land coupling design: the lack of a corresponding land cover harmonization. The CMIP5 CESM global afforestation is only 22% of GCAM’s 2005 to 2100 RCP4.5 afforestation. Likewise, only 17% of GCAM’s 2040 RCP4.5 afforestation, and zero pasture loss, were transmitted to CESM within the directly coupled model. This is a problem because afforestation was relied upon to achieve RCP4.5 climate stabilization. GLM modifications within the directly coupled model did not increase CESM afforestation. Modifying the CESM land use translator in addition to GLM, however, enabled CESM to simulate 66% of GCAM’s afforestation in 2040, and 94% of GCAM’s pasture loss as grassland and shrubland losses. This additional afforestation increases vegetation carbon gain by 19 PgC and decreases atmospheric CO2 gain by 8 ppmv from 2005 to 2040, implying different RCP4.5 climate scenarios between CMIP5 GCAM and CESM. Although the IAMs and ESMs were not expected to have exactly the same climate forcing, due in part to different terrestrial carbon cycles and atmospheric radiation algorithms, the ESMs were expected to project climates representative of the RCP scenarios. Similar land cover inconsistencies exist in other CMIP5 model results, primarily because land cover information is not shared between IAM and ESM models. High RCP4.5 afforestation might also contribute to inconsistencies as some ESMs might impose bioclimatic limits to potential forest area and have different rates of forest growth than projected by RCP4.5. Further work to harmonize land cover among models will be required to address this problem.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful imaging technique for measuring ground deformation, either through Interferometric SAR (InSAR) or image offset tracking. However, these methods are only applied to SAR images acquired by the same satellite, which limits the measurement capability for many earthquakes. Here we propose a novel approach that allows for calculating offsets between images acquired from the European ERS and Envisat satellites. To achieve this cross-sensor offset calculation, we first coregister pre-event (ERS) and post-event (Envisat) SAR images separately to generate averaged pre- and post-event SAR amplitude maps. We then compute the orbital offsets between these two maps in order to resample the ERS average map onto the grid of the averaged Envisat image. We finally calculate the cross-sensor image offsets based on cross-correlating selected sub-images distributed throughout the coregistered averaged SAR maps. Application to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake reveals, for the first time, its near-field coseismic displacement field right above the epicenter. We compare our measurements with the surface displacement field predicted from the published source model of Copley et al. [2011]. This model was derived from tele-seismic waveforms and limited far-field geodetic data. The comparison between the two displacement maps shows consistent displacement patterns, yet a systematic shift, which likely is due to the limited near-fault resolution of the data used in the previous model. We then perform a joint inversion using the newly derived SAR image offsets and tele-seismic waveforms. The preferred source model suggests a compact slip pattern at depths of 20-30 km with a peak slip of ~10 meters and a fairly short rise time (<3s). The large slip rate and low attenuation in the crust are likely responsible for the widely felt ground shaking despite of its compact source area. The result demonstrates that it is possible to correlate non-coherent SAR images acquired by different sensors to measure surface displacements. This approach extends further the possibility of mining the archive of SAR images for various types of earth-science studies.",

            "abstract": "Dams interrupt the downstream transport of sediment in rivers, accumulating sediment in the reservoir and depriving downstream reaches of their natural sediment load, with serious consequences for many deltas where lack of sediment supply has contributed to accelerated subsidence and coastal erosion. From the Indus to the Yellow, major Asian rivers are undergoing unprecedented rates of dam construction. On the Mekong, 7 dams are under construction on the mainstem in China and 133 proposed (or already built) for the Lower Mekong River and tributaries. Given its naturally high sediment loads (owing to its active tectonism), we can ask how much sediment will these dams trap, how will sedimentation affect reservoir sustainability, and how will sediment trapping deprive downstream reaches of their natural sediment loads and thus create problems of ‘hungry water’ in downstream channels and the delta. The question has been difficult to answer before because of the lack of sediment data for critical tributaries and uncertainties even for the better-documented mainstem. To overcome the lack of data, we adopted a geomorphic approach, delineating nine distinct regions for which we estimated sediment yields based on geomorphic characteristics, tectonic history, and the limited sediment transport data available. We used the 3-W model to estimate cumulative sediment trapping by these dams, accounting for changing trap efficiency over time and multiple dams on a single river system. Under a 38-dam ‘definite future’ scenario, cumulative sediment reduction to the Delta would be 51%. Under full build-out of all planned dams, cumulative sediment trapping would be 96%, ultimately depriving the Delta of nearly all its sediment load. This scenario would have profound consequences on productivity of the river and persistence of the Delta landform itself, and suggests that strategies to pass sediment through/around dams should be urgently explored to prevent or reduce the consequences of downstream sediment starvation.",

            "abstract": "To diagnose sedimentation environments through the geologic time, two sediments cores were recovered in the Northeast equatorial Pacific (PC120201: 9°57ʹN and 131°42ʹW in 5,080 m water depth; KODOS 02-01-02: 16°12ʹN and 125°59ʹW in 4,550 m water depth). Successive AF demagnetization reveals a well constrained characteristic component between AF fields of 15–50 mT with the maximum angular deviation of <10°. The component flips eight times in PC120201 and three times in KODOS 02-01-02 showing distinctive antipodal declination and inclination. In the reference geologic time scale, the eight and three reversal events correspond to the age of about 4.5 Ma and 1.8 Ma, respectively. However, 10Be based age correction shows 13.4 Ma at 465 cm depth in PC120201 and variable sedimentation rates of 0.1–2.44 mm/kyr, indicating many of magnetic reversal records are buried. In KODOS 02-01-02, rock-magnetic properties (i.e., magnetic concentration, grain size, and mineralogy) above 250 cm, composed of siliceous ooze and pelagic red clay, show gradual down-core increase of magnetic concentration and grain size. Such variation is well correlated with the down-core variation to 215 cm of PC120201. From the correlation, the estimated age at 215 cm depth of KODOS 02-01-02 is ~7 Ma and a sedimentation rate is ~0.36 mm/kyr. At this time, we test the possibility of rock-magnetic properties as an alternative age dating tool for deep-sea sediments. When detailed mineralogical data are complemented, rock-magnetic properties will answer the question about sediments provenance in spatial and temporal terms.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes such as the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and the 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake are often preceded by foreshock sequences migrating toward the hypocenters of mainshocks. Understanding the underlying physical processes is crucial for imminent seismic hazard assessment. Some of these foreshock sequences are accompanied by repeating earthquakes, which are thought to be a manifestation of a large-scale background slow slip transient. The alternative interpretation is that the migrating seismicity is simply produced by the cascade triggering of mainshock-aftershock sequences following Omori’s Law. In this case the repeating earthquakes are driven by the afterslip of the moderate to large foreshocks instead of an independent slow slip event. As an initial effort to discriminate these two hypotheses, we made a detailed analysis of the repeating earthquakes among the foreshock sequences of the 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake. We observed that some significant foreshocks (M >= 5.5) are followed by the rapid occurrences of local repeaters, suggesting the contribution of afterslip. However the repeaters are distributed in a wide area (~40*80 km), which are difficult to be driven by only a few moderate to large foreshocks. Furthermore, the estimated repeater-inferred aseismic moment during the foreshock period is at least 3.041e19 Nm (5*5 km grid), which is of the same order with the total amount of seismic moment of all foreshocks (2.251e19 Nm). This comparison again supports the slow-slip model since the ratio of post-seismic to coseismic moment is small in most earthquakes. To estimate the contributions of the transient slow slip and cascade triggering in the initiation of large earthquakes, we propose to systematically search and analyze repeating earthquakes in all foreshock sequences preceding large earthquakes. The next effort will be made to the long precursory phase of large interplate earthquakes such as the 1999 Mw 7.6 Izimit earthquake and the 2003 Mw 8.3 Tokachi-Oki earthquake.",

Policy makers and stakeholders also require a more unified scientific vision on the behavior of the CZ.\nThe CZ science is not new and many communities have been doing CZ science for many decades. CZ-type observatories have been developed in most of the countries for different aims but generally lack of an integrated approach. When hydrologic measurements are made, they are generally not associated to geochemical measurements and the situation is worst for biological parameters. Instrumental geophysics of the CZ has done impressive progresses over the last decades but the misfit between the scientific questions and instrumental development is still a challenging issue.\nWe will take the example of the French initiatives to build up a wide community of CZ scientists (“critical zonists”) at the national scale taking into account decades of instrumentation and observation. More than creating new CZOs the French national research agencies helped foster collaboration between existing infrastructures by funding networking activities and developing significant investment programs for new equipment. We will review the main challenges of creating CZ networks based on existing funded research infrastructures and highlight the main instrumental challenges that need to be addressed to explore and understand the CZ in a modern way. The French initiatives mirror the European initiatives and the need for developing the links between the geo-centered initiative CZ concept and the ecology-centered concepts of LTER (and more recently LTSER) at the European scale. This willingness of linking historically separated communities is a stimulating opportunity for the advance of integrated Earth and Life sciences. As quoted by Bruno Latour (2014) the new environmental challenges that human beings are facing need a « compositionist » approach that the CZ concept is providing. This will benefit to science but also meet the new societal needs that the major environmental changes are creating.\nLatour B.

Although numerous records exist across the North Atlantic region, few Antarctic ice core records have been obtained from the south.\nHere we exploit the potential of upwelling ancient ice – so-called blue ice areas (BIAs) – from the Patriot Hills in the Ellsworth Mountains to derive the first deuterium isotope record (dD) from continental Antarctica south of the Weddell Sea. Gas analysis and glaciological considerations provide a first relative chronology and provide new constraints on ice sheet dynamics in the region. Inferred temperature trends from the Patriot Hills BIA and snow pit suggest changing climate influences during the transition between the last glacial period and Holocene. Our results demonstrate the considerable potential of the Patriot Hills site for reconstructing past climate change in the south Atlantic region.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the Earth’s core is mainly composed of iron and contains light elements to account for its density deficit. Alloying with light elements significantly affects the physical properties of iron and depresses its melting temperature. Therefore, the melting relation of the Fe–light elements system is the key to clarify the thermal structure of the Earth’s core. Although there are many candidates for light elements in the core, sulfur and silicon are considered to be the major light elements. Some geochemical models predicted that sulfur and silicon could be present not only in the core of the Earth but also in the core of other terrestrial planets such as Mars and Mercury. To better understand the properties of the planetary cores, we investigated the melting relations of the Fe–S–Si system under high-pressure conditions.\nHere, we report the melting relations in the Fe–S–Si system up to 60 GPa. Melting experiments were performed in the pressure range of 20–60 GPa and the temperature range of 1300–2500 K using a double-sided laser-heated diamond anvil cell combined with X-ray diffraction technique. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted at the BL10XU beamline of the SPring-8 facility. The melting detection was based on disappearance of the X-ray diffraction peaks of the sample. On the basis of X-ray diffraction patterns, we confirmed that iron-silicon alloy which hcp and fcc structure and Fe3S are stable phases under subsolidus conditions. Both solidus and liquidus temperatures are significantly lower than the melting temperature of pure Fe and increases with pressure in this study. In order to draw the melting curve as a function of pressure, we fitted the present results using the Simon’s equation. Our results could provide important constraints on the thermal structure of the planetary cores.",

            "abstract": "Fabric anisotropy is a key control of rock behavior in different geological settings and over different timescales. However, the effect of tectonically folded fabrics on the brittle strength and failure mode of metamorphic rocks is poorly understood. Recent data, obtained from uniaxial compression experiments on folded gneiss (Agliardi et al., 2014), demonstrated that their brittle failure modes depend upon the arrangement of two anisotropies (i.e. foliation and fold axial planes) and that rock strength correlates with failure mode. Since lithostatic pressure may significantly affect this rock behavior, we investigated its effect in triaxial compression experiments. We tested the Monte Canale Gneiss (Italian Alps), characterized by low phyllosilicate content and compositional layering folded at the cm-scale. We used a servo-controlled hydraulic loading system to test 19 air-dry cylindrical specimens (ø = 54 mm) that were characterized both in terms of fold geometry and orientation of foliation and fold axial planes to the axial load direction. The specimens were instrumented with direct contact axial and circumferential strain gauges. Acoustic emissions and P- and S-wave velocities were measured by piezoelectric transducers mounted in the compression platens. The tests were performed at confining pressures of 40 MPa and axial strain rates of 5*10-6 s-1. Post-failure study of fracture mechanisms and related microfabric controls was undertaken using X-ray CT, optical microscopy and SEM. Samples failed in three distinct brittle modes produced by different combinations of fractures parallel to foliation, fractures parallel to fold axial planes, or mm-scale shear bands. The failure modes, consistent with those described in uniaxial compression experiments, were found to be associated with distinct stress-strain and acoustic emission signatures. Failure modes involving quartz-dominated axial plane anisotropy correspond to higher peak strength and axial strain, less brittle macroscopic behavior, and higher and more progressive acoustic emission activity than failure involving mica-dominated foliation anisotropy. Observed micro-scale mechanisms support a decisive control of micro-fabric associated to folding on crack nucleation and propagation, and overall mechanical behavior of rock.",

            "abstract": "By re-defining ‘excess helium’ as isotopic abundance of both helium isotopes normalized to those of the air, helium-3 and helium-4 in the soil gas stand out as two independent proxies of mantle and crustal degassing in the Yilan Plain, Taiwan. The spatial distribution of soil gas helium-3 correlates well with the locations of both shallow and deep structures; and its extent of anomaly indicates the depth of faults. Helium-3 also points out the locations of the dyke intrusion and the initial depression center of the Plain. Soil gas helium-4, on the other hand, does not reflect structure locations as well as helium-3. We suggest that the faults might have activated long ago so that crustal helium-4 had released to the atmosphere, while helium-3 still has constant supply from the mantle. One prominent feature–obvious abundance difference–shows up in spatial distribution of both helium-3 and helium-4 at longitude 121.75°. This feature could only be explained by the appearance of deep tectonic structures since helium-3 is a primordial gas from the deep earth. We believe that it is the location of the sharp plate boundary as proposed by Ustaszewski et al. (2012). However, we suggest that the location should be in the Plain rather than in the mountain area. The distribution of soil helium-4 also implies that the crustal delamination depth is ranged around 3-14 km, where the major heat-producing elements in the upper crust are heated, and thus enhance crustal degassing. With the new definition of excess helium, we found the interpretation of helium isotopes in soil gas is no longer affected by air contamination. Even soil gas samples are taken from surficial crust; helium isotopes are still useful to trace mantle and crustal degassing and could shed light on tectonic settings.",

            "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crop worldwide. Despite its importance, there is limited information on the function of different root segments and root types of maize in extracting water from soils. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate locations of root water uptake in maize.\nWe used neutron radiography to: 1) image the spatial distribution of maize roots in soil and 2) trace the transport of injected deuterated water (D2O) in soil and roots. Maizes were grown in aluminum containers (40×38×1 cm) filled with a sandy soil. When the plants were 16 days old, we injected D2O into selected soil regions containing primary, seminal and lateral roots. The experiments were performed during the day (transpiring plants) and night (not transpiring plants). The transport of D2O into roots was simulated using a new convection–diffusion numerical model of D2O transport into roots. By fitting the observed D2O transport we quantified the diffusional permeability and the water uptake of the different root segments.\nThe maize root architecture consisted of a primary root, 4-5 seminal roots and many lateral roots connected to the primary and seminal roots. Laterals emerged from the proximal 15 cm of the primary and seminal roots. Water uptake occurred primarily in lateral roots. Lateral roots had the highest diffusional permeability (9.4×10-7), which was around six times higher that the diffusional permeability of the old seminal segments (1.4×10-7), and two times higher than the diffusional permeability of the young seminal segments (4.7×10-7). The radial flow of D2O into the lateral (6.7×10-5 ) was much higher than in the young seminal roots (1.1×10-12). The radial flow of D2O into the old seminal was negligible.\nWe concluded that the function of the primary and seminal roots was to collect water from the lateral roots and transport it to the shoot. A maize root system with lateral roots branching from deep primary and seminal roots would be efficient in extracting water from the subsoil and better tolerate periods of water shortage. However, in this case the xylem axial resistance could be the limiting factor for the uptake of water.",

            "abstract": "The geodynamic setting of the northern Aegean is governed by the superimposition of NE-SW strike-slip deformation, associated with the propagation of the North Anatolian fault zone towards the west, and N-S extension, caused by the suction of the Aegean realm towards the south due to deep seated processes of trench retreat and slab rollback. The Mygdonia basin sits at the westernmost termination of the Kavala-Xanthi-Komotini fault zone, a structure that is considered the northernmost splay of the North Anatolian fault system in the northern Aegean. It is one of the most seismically active regions in continental northern Greece, and it is herein interpreted, for the first time, as a transtensional pull-apart structure that has been progressively established since the Early Pleistocene by westward directed rupture of NW-SE and NE-SW trending oblique slip normal faults and E-W trending normal faults. The interaction of the two, separate, stress regimes in the basin demands decreasing accumulated displacement from west to east to accommodate clockwise rotation. The close correspondence between analogue models of transtensional basins and the observed spatial distribution of faulting in the Mygdonia basin attests to the importance of oblique deformation in the basin-forming processes. Detailed topographic profiles across the fault-bounded ranges confirm the decreasing trend of accrued displacement from east to west. Furthermore, topographic swaths reveal the scaling of faulting into discrete segments along the basin-bounding ranges, while calcrete maturity on abandoned hanging wall fans reveals a towards-the-west diachronous faulting with associated fan sedimentation. The Early Pleistocene age of the initial fill of the basin complex and fault displacements on the order of many hundreds of meters point to dramatic and rapid landscape forming processes in this tectonically active region. The increasing appreciation of the interaction of both strike-slip deformation and extension better refines our understanding of basin forming events in this region, in contrast to a simplistic, end-member, pure extensional basin model.",

            "abstract": "How large can temporal variations in interseismic deformation rates be? Meltzner et al. (2014, in review) reported that fossil coral microatolls on Simeulue and the Banyak Islands of Sumatra, Indonesia, show contemporaneous temporal variations in interseismic subsidence rates. For example, a fossil coral microatoll located at Bangkaru, in the Banyak Islands, reveals interseismic subsidence for a 10-year period between 1956 and 1966, followed by a reversal to interseismic uplift for ~ 15 years from 1966 to 1981, before reverting back to interseismic subsidence after 1981. These temporal variations can neither be accounted for by regional or local sea level changes, nor by postseismic deformation following major historic megathrust earthquakes. These coral observations span a period of ~ 260 years. Such an extensive temporal record of interseismic deformation at subduction zones is rare, and it offers us a unique opportunity to better understand what physical processes likely control the behavior of this portion of the megathrust.\nIn this study, we use elastic dislocation models to explore the extent to which the observed spatio-temporal variations can be consistently explained by tectonic processes. Possible processes include temporal changes in either the width of the locked fault zone or the interseismic coupling coefficient, and/or slow-slip event occurrence. Our models incorporate a realistic fault dip geometry and subduction rate. Our results suggest that a change in the width of the locked zone with time can explain temporal variations in interseismic subsidence rates on Simeulue Island. In addition, the reversal of the sense of vertical displacement at Bangkaru can be explained by the occurrence of a large, long, slow-slip event on the underlying megathrust.",

            "abstract": "Although much of the deformation associated with Arabia-Eurasia collision and Aegean extension is expressed by westward translation of Central Anatolia along the North Anatolian and East Anatolian fault zones, important deformation also takes place in the interior. Major interior faults include the NE-SW striking, left-lateral Central Anatolian fault zone (CAFZ), which splays from the NAFZ, and the NW-SE striking, right-lateral Tuz Gölü fault zone (TGFZ). We examine fault kinematics and river incision in the triangular region bound by the TGFZ to the SW, the CAFZ to the E and the Salanda graben to the N, in order to document fault interaction and landscape development where these fault systems intersect. We document deformation in the footwall of the Tuz Gölü fault, recorded by the warping of ignimbrite and lacustrine units. We investigate the Salanda fault, which displaces a 1.23 Ma basalt flow by 40 m. Paleostress analysis indicates two deformation phases with maximum strain nearly parallel (191 for extension; 183 for shortening).The Salanda fault reactivates older mylonite near the town of Karaburna. We map faults in the interior of this region, including the N-S striking Derinkuyu fault and the newly identified Derbentbaşi fault. The Derinkuyu fault has been inactive since emplacement of a lava dome at its north end. The Derbentbaşi fault offsets lacustrine limestones and older ignimbrites in a right-lateral, west-side down sense prior to regional river incision. Pliocene lacustrine carbonates are largely confined to the hanging walls and footwalls of the TGFZ and the Yeşilhisar strand of the CAFZ; these deposits are deeply incised and can be used to constrain the pattern and timing of river incision. Along the Salanda graben, the Kızılırmak River has incised the surrounding region to a depth of 350 m. Our data suggest a complicated interaction between the TGFZ and CAFZ, with faulting distributed on multiple, obliquely striking structures, few of which remain active today. We also identify an important role for pre-existing weaknesses in governing the location and orientation of faults in this system. We find structural control on the location and/or preservation of lacustrine sedimentation, and evidence for significant recent incision due to regional uplift and local disruption along fault systems.",

            "abstract": "We show spatially-resolved temperature maps of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, main target of the ESA Rosetta spacecraft, as derived from infrared hyperspectral images acquired by the VIRTIS imaging spectrometer onboard the Rosetta Orbiter in the Mapping phase carried out in August and September 2014. These data were obtained during the Mapping phase, at variable spatial resolution (from roughly 100 m/px down to ~10 m/px), illumination conditions, and heliocentric distances (spanning the range from 3.6 to 3.4 AU).\nVIRTIS infrared spectra in the range longward of ~4 µm are affected by the thermal emission of the comet, hence the measured radiance in that spectral region can be used to determine surface temperatures and spectral emissivities by means of temperature-retrieval algorithms. We use a Bayesian approach that was previously applied to Rosetta/VIRTIS data obtained during the close flybys of asteroids 2678 Steins and 21 Lutetia, as well as to the entire dataset of infrared data acquired by the VIR mapping spectrometer aboard the Dawn spacecraft during its orbital phase at asteroid Vesta in 2011-2012.\nThe VIRTIS instrument onboard Rosetta is not sensitive to physical temperatures on the nightside of the comet, where the signal is considerably low. Typically, ~170 K is the minimum temperature that allows one to retrieve surface temperatures while preserving high accuracies. On the other hand, for a given local solar time, the maximum temperature depends on the solar incidence angle and on surface properties such as thermal inertia and albedo.\nThe availability of spatially-resolved, accurate temperature observations, significantly spaced out in local solar time, provides clues to the physical structure of specific surface units, which complements the mineralogical investigation based on imaging spectroscopy data collected at shorter wavelengths.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), ASI-INAF Contract n.

            "abstract": "The origin of jarosite [KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6] on the Martian surface has been an intriguing problem since the Mars Exploration Rover ‘Opportunity’ first revealed its presence at the Meridiani Planum on Mars. To explain its origin, several terrestrial analogue sites have been studied in different geographical zones. Although several models have been suggested, there is a consensus that only the prevalence of acidic and oxidizing aqueous environmental conditions are conducive to form jarosite. In the Kachchh region of Gujarat, western India, jarosite has been recently discovered from gorges dissecting the Paleocene Matanumadh Formation sediments, that overlie basalts of the Deccan Volcanic Province. This formation comprises pebble conglomerates, carbonaceous shales and purple sandstones capped by a laterite on top. Jarosite, in association with gypsum and goethite, has been detected through FTIR and VNIR spectrometry in almost all litho-units of the succession, albeit in different modes and concentrations. The occurrence of jarosite within black shale in other parts of the world, has been attributed to the oxidation of pyrites within the shale layers. However, in shales of the Matanumadh Formation, jarosite is restricted to fractures that cut across the bedding, while the overlying purple sandstone unit only preserves jarosite in shale clasts within the sandstone. Since the sandstone overlies the black shale layer, downward percolation of sulfate-bearing water from the oxidation of pyrite within the shale layer cannot explain jarosite formation in this unit. In addition, no jarosite is observed below or within pyrite-rich lignite bearing sections in other parts of Kachchh. Alternative suggestions, that jarosite developed in the immediate aftermath of Deccan volcanism as surface waters were rendered acidic by interaction with the final phase of volcanic effusives, are also unlikely as on-going studies suggest that jarosite is not restricted to the Matanumadh Formation. The consistent association of jarosite-bearing horizons with gypsum in Kachchh indicate that saline water intrusion may have played an important role in its formation. Since this association is also reported from the Meridiani Planum, a model explaining the origin of jarosite formation in Kachchh may also be relevant for the Martian surface.",

However these studies are usually performed on small cm-scale samples, typically below 100 mg. Such a small size, combined with anisotropy and other spurious effects have been shown to be the source of additional complexity [7].\nWe measured the natural remanent magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of 105 large Apollo samples (mass range 40 g to 2.9 kg, median mass 350 g). For this, following the approach utilized for the initial paleomagnetic evaluation of Apollo 11 samples [8], we developed a dedicated magnetometer using a fluxgate sensor and a rotating stage, which allowed measuring the bulk samples in their original Teflon and aluminum packaging under nitrogen atmosphere.\nDespite a number of caveats (no demagnetization steps, existence of viscous magnetization and other soft secondary magnetization), the ratio of natural remanent magnetization to susceptibility gives a rough estimate of the paleointensity. The evolution of the paleointensity with the estimated age of the samples will provide a broad picture of the evolution of the lunar dynamo. Susceptibility, as a proxy to the bulk metal content in lunar rocks [9], is also a valuable source of information per se but is currently available only for a small fraction of the Apollo collection. Our survey will allow identification of rocks with unusual magnetic properties, and therefore potentially unusual petrogenesis.\n",

These are spread across a vast area, from northern AK to the Aleutians. Forty-five of these stations were installed or have been upgraded in cooperation with various partner agencies and currently provide data collection and transmission for more than one group. Leveraging existing infrastructure normally has multiple benefits, such as easier permitting requirements and costs savings through reduced overall construction and maintenance expenses.\nAt some sites, PBO-AK power and communications systems have additional capacity beyond that which is needed for reliable acquisition of GPS data. Where permits allow, such stations could serve as platforms for additional instrumentation or real-time observing needs. With the expansion of the Transportable Array (TA) into Alaska, there is increased interest to leverage existing EarthScope resources for station co-location and telemetry integration. Because of the complexity and difficulty of long-term O&M at PBO sites, however, actual integration of GPS and seismic equipment must be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nUNAVCO currently operates two integrated GPS/seismic stations in collaboration with the Alaska Earthquake Center, and three with the Alaska Volcano Observatory. By the end of 2014, PBO and TA plan to install another four integrated and/or co-located geodetic and seismic systems. While three of these are designed around existing PBO stations, one will be a completely new TA installation, providing PBO with an opportunity to expand geodetic data collection in Alaska within the limited operations and maintenance phase of the project.\nWe will present some of the design considerations, outcomes, and lessons learned from past and ongoing projects to integrate seismometers and other instrumentation at PBO-Alaska stations. Developing the PBO network as a platform for ongoing research and hazard monitoring equipment may also continue to serve the needs of the research community and the public beyond the sun-setting and completion of EarthScope science plan in 2018.",

After more than 10 years of measurements a good number of measurements exists from Titan’s ionosphere. This allows for statistical studies of the structure of Titan’s ionosphere. The electron density has been shown to vary significantly from one flyby to the next, as well as on longer time scales and here we discern some of the reasons for the observed ionospheric variability. Firstly, following the rise to the recent solar maximum we show how the ionospheric peak density, normalized to a common solar zenith angle, Nnorm clearly varies with the ~11-year solar cycle. Nnorm correlates well with the solar energy flux Fe and we find that Nnorm ∝ Fek, with k = 0.54 ± 0.18, which is close to the theoretical value of 0.5. Secondly, we present results that indicate that the ionospheric density in the topside ionosphere (altitude range 1200-2400 km) are generally significantly increased, roughly by a factor of 2, when Titan is located in the post-midnight sector of Saturn, i.e. at Saturn local times 00 - 03 h, compared to other local time sectors. We suggest that this increase could be caused by additional particle impact ionization from reconnection events in the Saturn tail.",

            "abstract": "The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; ~40 Ma) stands out as a middle-term (~500 kyr) interval of warming, interrupting the long-term cooling starting in the latest early Eocene.To characterize oceanographic and biotic changes related to the MECO, we performed a multiproxy investigation at Site 1263 (Walvis Ridge; 28°31.98′S, 02°46.77′E, 2 Km paleodepth), which has a continuous record, not affected by carbonate dissolution. We coupled surface to bottom oxygen and carbon stable isotopes, TEX86, and biotic records from biomarker and micropaleontological analysis to first document both MECO climate change and its effects in an open ocean, SE Atlantic setting. Benthic foraminiferal, coarse fraction and fine fraction accumulation rates were used as proxies for benthic, planktic foraminiferal and nannoplankton productivity, and the abundance of crenarchaeol, biomarker of widespread archaeal nitrifiers, to infer ammonia utilization rates. Our records show an uniform, surface-to-deep warming during MECO at mid southern latitudes. In parallel, benthic and planktic foraminiferal productivity decreased markedly, whereas rates of ammonia consumption increased, while primary productivity and water column stratification appear unchanged. We ascribe these biotic changes to MECO warming, due to the temperature-dependency of metabolic rates, particularly of heterotrophic respirators (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2009). Increased oceanic temperature would have altered pelagic food webs, increasing heterotrophs metabolic rates, thus food needs. Therefore planktic foraminiferal populations declined, and organic matter remineralization in the water-column, i.e., ammonia production, increased. The carbon flux to the sea-floor decreased, starving benthic foraminifera. A decrease in organic carbon export and burial, if widespread in oligotrophic open-ocean areas, would have been important to sustain pCO2rise during the early phase of MECO.\n",

            "abstract": "The Mekong Delta (Vietnam) is highly vulnerable to the many impacts of global environmental change as well as to the accelerating anthropogenic changes in the catchment and in the delta itself. Today the delta is an agricultural landscape controlled by engineering structures such as channels, dykes, embankments, and sluice gates. These structures have been constructed gradually over the last 200 years mainly for irrigation and flood control in the upper part of the delta and to control saline intrusion in the coastal areas. Recent changes in the hydrology mainly driven by upstream hydropower development on the mainstream and the tributaries of the Mekong will likely have far reaching impacts on the delta´s social-ecological systems through changes in e.g. sedimentation processes, nutrient transport as well as the health of aquatic ecosystems. Further threats to the delta include sea level rise and an increase in seasonal rainfall variability leading to an increase in flood variability. These changes affect the lives of millions of low-income inhabitants who depend on the ecosystem services provided by the Mekong for their livelihoods and sustenance. Since the changes in ecosystem service provision are occurring relatively fast while the resource dependency of the delta population is very high, adaptation becomes a challenge. An assessment of livelihood dependencies on ecosystem services requires an understanding of ecosystem services affected by different drivers of change, as well as of the types of livelihoods likely to be jeopardized as a result of these changes. We will present main ecosystem services supporting specific livelihoods, discuss how they are threatened, and analyse the merits of potential solutions. Options based solely on grey infrastructure might be problematic on the long term while an integration of ecosystem based solution such as a (re)adaptation of agricultural production systems to floods in the upper delta might be a more sustainable option. As the importance of policy interventions was demonstrated for the region, we argue that adaptation to climate change needs to be facilitated by policies embedded in a more flexible and adaptive agricultural development plan for the delta also considering no regret ecosystem based solutions with additional benefits for livelihoods.",

In December 2013, the Chinese Chang’e-3 (CE-3) spacecraft, carrying the Yutu (Jade Rabbit) rover, successfully landed on the northern Mare Imbrium, the Moon. The surface in-situ radar experiments by CE-3 mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the shallow subsurface geology of the Moon. While the processing and interpretation of radar observations usually depend on certain geophysical models and should consider regional geological settings. In this work, we quantified the subsurface structure at the CE-3 landing site using imaging data and illustrated a multi-layer subsurface structure model including three layers of regolith, two layers of basalt deposits and one layer of ejecta. Our result can provide essential references for CE-3 radar data processing and interpretation. The CE-3 radar observations can in turn validate previous technique for quantifying subsurface geology using imaging data, thus further deepening our understanding of lunar geoscience and exploration.",

Few studies have been carried out for the interaction of the weakly to moderately stable stratified atmosphere and the urban canopy. This study performs a large-eddy simulation of a modeled street canyon within a weakly to moderately stable atmosphere boundary layer. To better resolve the smaller eddy size resulted from the stable stratification, a higher spatial and temporal resolution is used. The detailed flow structure and turbulence inside the street canyon are analyzed. The relationship of pollutant dispersion and Richardson number of the atmosphere is investigated. Differences between these characteristics and those under neutral and unstable atmosphere boundary layer are emphasized.",

            "abstract": "Density and seismic wave velocity are fundamental properties of rocks that are often measured only through laboratory experiments. In northern Italy the major concern in crustal models is due to the presence of the Po Plain, a huge basin filled with a Plio-Quaternary sedimentary sequence whose thickness varies from few hundred meters to some kilometers, bounded by the northern Apennines and the Alps. In order to better characterize the first few kilometers of the crust in the Po Plain and surrounding regions we have used wireline borehole logs in 64 selected deep wells. We have analyzed all available stratigraphic profiles, geophysical logs and particularly 37 sonic logs. From these latter data we have characterized the P-wave velocity trend with depth and for each recognized lithology. Densities have been estimated following an empirical relationship between sonic velocity and density in sedimentary rocks: in the Po Plain the mean density value is 2.25 g/cm3, whereas the maximum density of the shallow crust in the Apennine is around 2.65 g/cm3. We have also calculated the vertical stress magnitude in each well: the Po Plain shows a maximum regional lithostatic gradient around 21 MPa/km while in the Apennines belt the values are around 26 MPa/km. Although in this area a 2D crustal velocity model does not adequately constrain the complicated and uneven tectonics, we have established a shallow crust model consisting of five layers. These direct data, together with other derived geological and geophysical information, can contribute to build a 3D model of the area.",

            "abstract": "The wide geographical distribution of bivalve shells makes them much favoured paleoclimate proxy archives. However, they are amongst the materials most affected by physiological effects, making the correct deciphering of these archives a challenging task. Shell building plans are usually hierarchic, thus optimizing mechanical properties. However, different structures common to certain bivalve families, such as the prism-nacre or the crossed-lamellar structures, are assembled from very different building blocks. These structural differences coincide with chemical and crystallographic differences suggesting critically different formation mechanisms within the bivalve class. Most importantly some bivalves form their shells from amorphous calcium carbonate that crystallizes in situ once assembled into the shell. We present new correlated multi-scale structural and compositional data for different shell bivalve shell structures such as nacre-prism, cross-lamellar intermediate structures. Data are obtained using EBSD, FIB-assisted TEM and Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction combined with Nano-SIMS and Raman Microspectrometry and suggest that formation from amorphous phases is widespread and results in different calcium carbonate polymorphs to be present in the shell with distinct chemical compositions. The results highlight the complex nature of the biomaterials, which has consequences for the precision and accuracy of paleotemperature calculations.",

            "abstract": "Detrital thermochronology of modern river sands from the Alaska Range quantifies the timing, extent, and magnitude of regional exhumation during Cenozoic subduction and translation along the southern Alaska margin. This detrital approach provides an effective way to quantify regional exhumation in remote areas like Alaska, where sampling bedrock and acquiring exhumation data for large areas requires tremendous effort. We present apatite and zircon fission track (FT) and zircon U/Pb ages from 13 catchments that span 450 km east to west along the Alaska Range. Zircon U/Pb ages indicate a dominant igneous first-cycle source that comprises >90% of most age distributions, even in areas where igneous outcrop comprises <10% of the catchment area. In addition, zircon FT age peaks are equivalent to zircon U/Pb age peaks in most cases, suggesting contemporaneous pluton cooling from 800°C through 240°C. On the other hand, apatite FT ages that record cooling through 110°C are younger and illuminate exhumation during mountain-building. We deconvolved detrital apatite FT age distributions into constituent age peaks. Overall, the young apatite FT age peaks are commonly 9-4 Ma and of high proportion in the central Alaska Range, as well as on the western and eastern ends of the range. In more detail, catchments draining both Mt. Foraker and the eastern Alaska Range have dominant 4 Ma age peaks in contrast to 9-6 Ma age peaks near Denali (Mt. McKinley) and in the western Alaska Range. These data suggest a large but discontinuous region of Late Miocene-Pliocene exhumation during growth of the Alaska Range, with exhumation influenced by local structures. In addition, most catchments display a 25-20 Ma peak that indicates regional exhumation concurrent with the onset of Yakutat flat slab subduction along the southern Alaska margin. Finally, some catchments display a 50-45 Ma peak that suggests localized exhumation during and after spreading ridge subduction along the southern Alaska margin. To estimate age-elevation relationships in each catchment, we employ recent Bayesian inverse modeling of cooling ages and hypsometries. We demonstrate the utility of this technique for the Ruth and Kahiltna catchments draining Denali, where new detrital data, as well as a previous bedrock vertical transect, both suggest a 7-6 Ma onset of rapid erosion.",

In the last couple of years sophisticated 3D simulation try to address the response of the induced magnetosphere and its escape to different time-dependent drivers. Modolo et al (2012) discussed about timescales required for the induced magnetosphere to recover from an IMF rotation. Ma et al (2013) used time-varying solar wind conditions (density and velocity enhancement) and concluded that the ionospheric/atmospheric system reach a new equilibrium in few hours. We use a 3D parallel multi-species hybrid simulation model to study the response of the induced magnetosphere to a time-varying solar wind dynamic pressure. The hybrid model (Modolo et al, 2014, in prep) includes crustal fields, a ionospheric chemistry scheme and uses a 3D description of the Martian thermosphere (Chaufray et al, 2014) and exosphere (Yagi et al, 2012). The impact of a solar wind dynamic pressure change on plasma boundaries is discussed. A special attention is focused on the time-varying energy deposition in the upper atmosphere by O+ ions precipitation as well as the escape flux of planetary ions.",

In this region monitoring coastal evolution and the impact of sea storms is a primary administrative need, as a large part of the economic income derives from summer tourism.\nIn two years, we accumulated almost 200 hours of flight with two different UAVs, a professional-grade Mikrokopter Okto and a consumer-grade Phantom DJI. We used photogrammetric and orthorectification techniques to obtain Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and orthophotos of different beaches in the region.\nData from UAVs allowed us to answer several questions. What is the accuracy of DEMs obtained from UAVs in low-relief areas such as beaches? What are the problems encountered in the photogrammetric procedure near the shoreline? Are the results obtained with consumer-grade UAVs comparable to those obtained with professional-grade ones?\nAside from these technical questions, we used the data obtained from UAVs for different local studies aimed at giving management tools to the local administrations. We used the cloudpoint obtained from DEMs and the orthophotos to set up a runup modelling chain, to detect short-term changes in the coastal zone, and to give a first estimate of the debris deposited on the beach after a major storm.\nAs stated by Watts et al., 2012 (Remote Sensing 4, 1671-1692) the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and photogrammetry techniques in earth sciences is flourishing, and has the potential to revolutionize the study of geomorphology. Surely, UAVs opened new research perspectives for our group, which has been actively working on coastal changes in Liguria for almost 25 years.",

            "abstract": "Infrasound is an efficient monitoring technique to remotely detect and characterize explosive sources such as volcanoes. Simulation methods incorporating realistic source and propagation effects have been developed to quantify the detection capability of any network. These methods can also be used to optimize the network configuration (number of stations, geographical location) in order to reduce the detection thresholds taking into account seasonal effects in infrasound propagation. Recent studies have shown that remote infrasound observations can provide useful information about the eruption chronology and the released acoustic energy. Comparisons with near-field recordings allow evaluating the potential of these observations to better constrain source parameters when other monitoring techniques (satellite, seismic, gas) are not available or cannot be made. Because of its regular activity, the well-instrumented Mount Etna is in Europe a unique natural repetitive source to test and optimize detection and simulation methods. The closest infrasound station part of the International Monitoring System is located in Tunisia (IS48). In summer, during the downwind season, it allows an unambiguous identification of signals associated with Etna eruptions. Under the European ARISE project (Atmospheric dynamics InfraStructure in Europe, FP7/2007-2013), experimental arrays have been installed in order to characterize infrasound propagation in different ranges of distance and direction. In addition, a small-aperture array, set up on the flank by the University of Firenze, has been operating since 2007. Such an experimental setting offers an opportunity to address the societal benefits that can be achieved through routine infrasound monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The Lake of Monate is located in the Lombardia region, in Northern Italy, close to the highest peaks of the Alps. The lake surface is about 2.5 square kilometers, with a maximum and mean water depth of 34 and 18 meters, respectively. Intensive agricultural cultivation and mining activities took place in the surrounding area since ancient times, as well as intensive urban and industrial development in the recent past. Notwithstanding the above anthropic activity, and the urbanization along the lake banks, the Lake of Monate is still close to pristine conditions, therefore being a unique example of ecosystem in equilibrium. The human impact is negligble because the lake has no tributaries, being the water inflow supplied by groundwater fluxes only, providing an average inflow volume of about 3.18 million of cubic meters. Since Roman times intensive mining activities are taking place in a large area that is located outside the geographical contributing catchment to the lake. In fact, the two mining sites of Cava Faraona and Cava Santa Maria are placed beyond the geographical divide between the Lake of Monate and the contiguous Lake of Ternate. However, the presence of subsurface rock layers that are tilted towards the Lake of Monate makes the actual contributing catchment more extended, therefore including the mining sites. For this reason, the recent decision to intensify the mining activities induced relevant concerns for the possible impact on the ecological equilibrium of the lake. Therefore, the local administration promoted an intensive monitoring campaign finalized to reach a better understanding of the hydrology of the lake and the subsurface water fluxes, to quantify the actual impact of the mining works. Meteorological and hydrological data at several location and fine time scale are being collected from Fall 2013 therefore putting together an experimental data set of relevant scientific value. This contribution aims to present the meteorological, hydrological and ecological data base of the Lake of Monate to the scientific community and the first findings on the hydrology of the lake and the hydrological disturbance induced by the mining activities. The results show that particular care should be taken when estimating the human impact in catchments where groundwater flow is the main driver of hydrological fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Interdependency between water and energy is generally transacted in trade-off mode; where either of the resource gets affected because of the other. Generally this trade-off is commonly known as water–energy nexus. Many studies have been undertaken in various parts of the world using various approaches to tease out the intricate nexus. This research has adopted a different approach to quantify the inter-dependency. The adopted approach made an attempt to tease out the nexus from demand side for both the resources. For water demand assessment PODIUM Sim model was used and for other parameters available secondary data was used. Using this approach percentage share of water for energy and energy for water was estimated. For an informed decision making and sustainable development, assessment was carried out at state level as most of the policies are made specifically for the state. The research was done for the southernmost state of India, Tamil Nadu which is a rapidly growing industrial hub. Tamil Nadu is energy and water intensive state and the analysis shows that the share of water demand from energy sector compared to water demand from other major sectors is miniscule. While, the energy demand in water sector for various processes in different sectors compared to energy demand as total has a comparable share of range 15-25%. This analysis indicated the relative risk sectors face in competition for the resource. It point outs that water sector faces fierce competition with other sectors for energy. Moreover, the results of the study has assessed that state has negative water balance, which may make access to water more energy intensive with time. But, a projection into future scenario with an assumption based on the ongoing policy program of improving irrigation efficiency was made. It provided a solution of a potential positive equilibrium which conserves both water and energy. This scenario gave promising results which indicated less of water demand from agricultural sector which is the most water intensive sector in the state, less requirement of energy for irrigation and improvement in overall water balance of the state.With the changing climate and growing population, resources at crisis can be managed sustainably if this nexus is decoded to understand the interdependency.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor heat flow measurements provide fundamental geophysical information that can be used to better understand tectonic processes. Regional heat flow patterns have been successfully used to study the cooling of the oceanic lithosphere, exhumation of deep crustal materials, strength of the faults, and other geological processes. However, sometimes there are variations of heat flows within a small area, making the interpretation of the heat flows difficult. Here we study the geological processes that can cause such variations. Over the last two decades, we have collected many dense 2D and 3D seismic reflection data offshore SW Taiwan and there is a wide-spread bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) found in the seismic profiles. The BSR is interpreted as associated with the base of the gas hydrate stability zone, and can be used to infer the temperature fields at shallow oceanic crust using a hydrate phase diagram. Such a dense and wide-spread dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to study processes that can affect temperature fields in scales less than a kilometer. Here we show evidence of bathymetry-induced temperature perturbations at shallow oceanic crust by comparing the BSR-based temperature data with the temperature derived from steady-state 3D finite element modeling. We have also documented focused fluid flow migration along faults and fissures based on elevated temperature fields near those geological features. We also found seismic evidence of abnormal high heat flows caused by rapid erosion. Our results demonstrate that sometimes it is necessary to correct those effects before the heat flow data can be used for regional studies. Our study is among the first to provide observational data to study small-scale geological processes affecting seafloor temperature fields. Such information might also be important for gas and oil reservoir studies.",

            "abstract": "Fabricated all sky imagers are efficient and cost effective instruments for cloud detection and classification. Continuous operation of this instrument can result in the determination of cloud occurrence and cloud base heights for the paired system. In this study, a fabricated paired sky imaging system – consisting two commercial digital cameras (Canon Powershot A2300) enclosed in weatherproof containers - is developed in Manila Observatory for the purpose of determining cloud base heights at the Manila Observatory area. One of the cameras is placed on the rooftop of Manila Observatory and the other is placed on the rooftop of the university dormitory, 489m from the first camera. The cameras are programmed to simultaneously gather pictures every 5 min. Continuous operation of these cameras were implemented since the end of May of 2014 but data collection started end of October 2013. The data were processed following the algorithm proposed by Kassianov et al (2005). The processing involves the calculation of the merit function that determines the area of overlap of the two pictures. When two pictures are overlapped, the minimum of the merit function corresponds to the pixel column positions where the pictures have the best overlap. In this study, pictures of overcast sky prove to be difficult to process for cloud base height and were excluded from processing. The figure below shows the initial results of the hourly average of cloud base heights from data collected from November 2013 to July 2014. Measured cloud base heights ranged from 250m to 1.5km. These are the heights of cumulus and nimbus clouds that are dominant in this part of the world. Cloud base heights are low in the early hours of the day indicating low convection process during these times. However, the increase in the convection process in the atmosphere can be deduced from higher cloud base heights in the afternoon. The decrease of cloud base heights after 15:00 follows the trend of decreasing solar energy in the atmosphere after this time. The results show the potential of these instruments to determine cloud base heights on prolonged time intervals. The continuous operation of these instruments is implemented to gather seasonal variation of cloud base heights in this part of the world and to add to the much-needed dataset for future climate studies in Manila Observatory.",

The averaged instantaneous OPEs estimated via the ship-plume photochemical/dynamic modeling for the ITCT 2K2 ship-plume ranged between 4.61 and 18.92, showing that the values vary with the extent of chemical evolution (or chemical stage) of the ship plume and the stability classes of the marine boundary layer (MBL). Together with the averaged instantaneous OPEs, the equivalent OPEs for the entire ITCT 2K2 ship-plume were also estimated. The values of the equivalent OPEs varied between 9.73 (for the stable MBL) and 12.73 (for the moderately stable MBL), which agreed well with the equivalent OPEs of 12.85 estimated based on the ITCT 2K2 ship-plume observations. It was also found that both the model-simulated and observation-based equivalent OPEs inside the ship-plume were 0.29-0.38 times smaller than the equivalent OPEs calculated/measured outside the ITCT 2K2 ship-plume. Lower OPEs insides the ship plume were due to the high levels of NO. Possible implications of this ship-plume OPE study in the global chemistry-transport modeling are also discussed in this study.",

            "abstract": "Carbonatite volcanism generally occurs in intra-plate settings associated with continental rifting. The only active carbonatitic volcano is the Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania, which generates sodium-rich carbonatites in close association with phonolites and nephelinites1. The processes of carbonatite genesis are still unresolved, however carbonate-bearing melts evidently play a crucial role during mantle melting, in diamond formation and as metasomatic agents. Carbonate melts show extraordinary properties, especially in regard to their low melt viscosities and densities, high surface tensions and electrical conductivities as well as distinct geochemical affinities to a wide range of trace elements2. Understanding the structural properties of carbonate-bearing melts is fundamental to explaining their chemical and physical behaviour as well as modeling processes operating in the deep Earth. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a versatile tool for element specific investigation of the short to medium range structure of melts and glasses. This study focuses on unraveling the influence of carbonate concentration on the structural incorporation of the geochemically important trace elements Y and Sr in silicate and carbonate melts in the system Na2O-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2. First, we present structural data of silicate glasses with up to 10 wt% CO2, quenched from melts under high temperature and pressure, which indicate that the local structure of Y and Sr is not or only slightly affected by CO2. Melts with higher CO2 contents could not be quenched to glass, so far. Second, we show results of high pressure, high temperature experiments conducted in the Paris Edinburgh-Press, which provides in-situ insight into carbonate-silicate melts. All EXAFS measurements were performed at the synchrotron facility beamlines SAMBA (SOLEIL) and BM23 (ESRF). Information derived from the trace elements’ local structure is used to develop a structural model for carbonate-silicate melts. The ultimate goal is to gain insight into the structural control on chemical fractionation processes in carbonate-bearing magmatic systems in the deep Earth.\n1.

            "abstract": "Many cases of pronounced amplification evident in strong ground motion recordings have been reported at sites with specific topographic features in last four decades. Although attempts have been made to explain such observations with the effect of the terrain geometry, the strong levels of observed amplification remain unexplained most of the time. However, the recent growth of seismic monitoring networks with appropriate site characterization allows for more systematic studies. We present results obtained for a number of elevated sites in Switzerland and Japan. A detailed site characterization, including measured S-wave velocity profiles down to 30-200 m, is available for these sites, as well as empirical amplification functions relative to a derived reference rock profile. On the one hand, we have not identified any general link between the geometrical features of the surface topography and the observed site response. On the other hand, the subsurface structure presents seismic velocity gradients even at outcropping rock sites. The studied rock sites (Vs30 > 800 m/s), on average, do not exhibit any systematic amplification, while the rest of the sites (Vs30 < 800 m/s) present frequency dependent amplifications with respect to reference rock condition. The observed amplification seems to be controlled in first place by the subsurface velocity structure. Finally, detailed 3D numerical modeling of seismic response was performed for a number of these sites. The joint effects of the terrain geometry and available velocity gradients are investigated. The synthetic amplification functions are compared with the empirical ones, and limits of the adopted models are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Sorting of sedimentary rocks is a proxy for the environmental conditions at the time of deposition, in particular the runoff that moved and deposited the material forming the rocks. Settling of sediment is strongly influenced by the gravity of a planetary body. As a consequence, sorting of a sedimentary rock varies with gravity for a given depth and velocity of surface runoff. Theoretical considerations for spheres indicate that sorting is less uniform on Mars than on Earth for runoff of identical depth. The effects of gravity on flow hydraulics limit the use of common, semi-empirical models developed to simulate particle settling in terrestrial environments, on Mars. Assessing sedimentation patterns on Mars, aimed at identifying strata potentially hosting traces of life, is potentially affected by such uncertainties. Using first-principle approaches, e.g. through Computational Fluid Dynamics, for calculating settling velocities on other planetary bodies requires a large effort and is limited by the values of boundary conditions, e.g. the shape of the particle. The degree of uncertainty resulting from the differences in gravity on Earth and Mars was therefore tested during three reduced-gravity flights, the MarsSedEx I and II missions, conducted in November 2012 and 2013. Nine types of sediment, ranging in size, shape and density were tested in custom-designed settling tubes during parabolas of Martian gravity lasting 20 to 25 seconds. Based on the observed settling velocities, the uncertainties of empirical relationships developed on Earth to assess particle settling on Mars are discussed. In addition, the potential effects of reduced gravity on patterns of erosion, transport and sorting of sediment, including the implications for identifying strata bearing traces of past life on are examined.",

From a series of meetings of the Continental Margins Working Group co-sponsored by IMBER and LOICZ of IGBP, we conclude that the greatest urgency exists at the ocean-land interface – the continental margins or the Margin – which extends from coastlands over continental shelves and slopes bordering the deep ocean. The Margin is enduring quadruple squeeze from (i) Population growth and rising demands for resources; (ii) Ecosystem degradation and loss; (iii) Rising CO2, climate change and alteration of marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems; and (iv) Rapid and irreversible changes in social-ecological systems. Some areas of the Margin that are subject to the greatest pressures (e.g. the Arctic) are also those for which knowledge of fundamental processes remains most limited. Aside from improving our basic understanding of the nature and variability of the Margin, priority issues include: (i) investment reform to prevent lethal but profitable activities; (ii) risk reduction; and (iii) jurisdiction, equity and fiscal responsibility. However, governance deficits or mismatches are particularly pronounced at the ocean-edge of the Margin and the prevailing Law of the Sea is incapable of resolving these challenges. The “gold rush” of accelerating demands for space and resources, and variability in how this domain is regulated, move the Margin to the forefront of global sustainability research and action. We outline a research strategy in 3 engagement arenas: (a) knowledge and understanding of dynamic Margin processes; (b) development, innovation and risk at the Margin; and (c) governance for sustainability on the Margin. The goals are (1) to better understand Margin social-ecological systems, including their physical and biogeochemical components; (2) to develop practical guidance for sustainable development and use of resources; (3) to design governance regimes to stem unsustainable practices; (4) to investigate how to enable equitable sharing of costs and benefits from sustainable use of resources; and (5) to evaluate alternative research approaches and partnerships that address the challenges faced on the Margin.",

            "abstract": "Melt inclusions record more extreme isotopic variability than their bulk host lavas and offer the potential to better constrain mantle components that contribute to magmatism. Isotopic analyses of melt inclusions are, however, challenging because of their limited size. To date, Sr and Pb isotope data have been obtained for oceanic islands by application of in situ analysis techniques, either by SIMS or LA-(MC)-ICPMS. Comprehensive studies of inclusions from other settings have yet to be performed. Here, we report the first combined Sr and Nd isotope data on individual melt inclusions from Pliocene-Quaternary K-rich lavas from mainland Italy, obtained using wet chemistry techniques and TIMS analysis. We use newly developed 1013 Ohm resistors mounted in the feedback loop of Faraday cup amplifiers. Compared to default 1011 Ohm resistors, use of 1013 Ohm resistors results in a 10-fold improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio and more precise data when analysing small ion beams (< 20 mV). Twenty-one olivine hosted (85 – 92 mol % Fo) melt inclusions from seven volcanic centres along the Italian peninsula were analysed. Inclusions were homogenised and analysed for trace elements prior to isotopic analysis. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the melt inclusions range from 0.70508 to 0.71543; 143Nd/144Nd ratios from 0.51175 to 0.51268. Significant differences in 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd were found between melt inclusions and host lavas indicating distinct evolution paths for the lava groundmasses and the primitive melts that were trapped in the phenocrysts. The isotopic variability is interpreted to be the result of (1) mixing of melts derived from a heterogeneous mantle modified by subduction-related metasomatism, (2) mingling of distinct batches of olivine-bearing magma within a plumbing system, and (3) local assimilation of crustal material. These preliminary data suggest that combined analysis of individual melt inclusions for trace elements and Sr-Nd isotope ratios is a promising tool for identifying distinct components in magma source regions in complex tectonic settings.",

            "abstract": "When decision makers plan adaptation to climate change, they have to consider time variation of the effectiveness of adaptation. Since climate is expected to keep changing, the adaptation which is considered optimal at a certain time may become insufficient later. Several existing studies have proposed a concept termed “adaptation pathways” that are generated based on the assumption that another option needs to be implemented if a certain option no longer meets specific objectives (Haasnoot et al., 2012). We developed nation-wise adaptation pathways globally for wheat production under the projected climate change over the 21st century. We considered two adaptation options: (1) expanding irrigation infrastructure; and (2) switching crop varieties. We calculated wheat yield with varying irrigated area and the number of selectable crop varieties using a crop model called M-GAEZ. Then we generated adaptation pathways to maintain current country-based yield. We found that both the adaptation pathways and yield changes led were different among countries. In this session, we argue the difference in optimal timing and variety of adaptation options among countries.",

            "abstract": "The Piedmont region of the southeastern United States is characterized by rolling topography, high precipitation, heavily weathered soils, and, after the immigration of European settlers, heavy anthropogenic degradation. Starting in the early eighteenth century and lasting until the early twentieth, intensive cultivation of cotton and tobacco dramatically altered the physical and biogeochemical landscape. Over roughly two centuries it has been estimated that the southern Piedmont lost 17 cm of soil to erosion due to the aforementioned cultivation, combined with poor erosion controls and annual precipitation of 1300 mm. The 20 km2 Calhoun Experimental Forest was opened in 1947 as a unit of the Sumter National Forest in upstate South Carolina to study what we would now term restoration ecology on such a heavily degraded landscape, which it did until it was closed as an active research site in the 1960’s. It left behind an extensive hydrologic and climatologic record in four small watersheds over the roughly twenty year period of active research, flow gauging infrastructure in the form of four v-notch weirs, and a compelling but currently incomplete story of the critical zone lying at the intersection of long-term critical zone evolution and rapid, anthropogenic degradation of that same critical zone. With the designation of Calhoun as the newest Critical Zone Observatory we now begin to address the questions originally sought by the Calhoun experimental forest: how the critical zone evolves after centuries of heavy degradation and to what degree that evolution could be considered recovery. Here we present preliminary findings derived from historic data and from the initial stages of a multi-faceted field campaign including soil and geophysical surveys, spatially distributed soil and stream hydrologic measurements, and high-resolution terrain analysis to characterize the spatial extent of degradation or recovery and begin to constrain the temporal trajectory of this heavily impacted critical zone.",

            "abstract": "Since the last volcanic unrest occurred in 1976-77, the Guadeloupe Volcanological and Seismological Observatory (OVSG-IPGP) has recorded a systematic progressive increasing of the volcanic activity in term of seismicity and degassing, with the progressive reactivations of fumarolles. Between 1981 and 2013, this activity is characterized by a low magnitude seismicity occurred in swarm sequences. Observatory’s standard locations shows that more than 95% of seismic events is concentrated in a volume of ∼ 125 km3 in the shallow part of the volcano (5 kms ×5 kms × 5 kms), centred below the andesitic dome. Following these features, we investigated the relationship between this seismicity and the dynamic of the hydrothermal system. First, we perform an iterative travel times delays inversion to estimate the Vp/Vs ratio and study physical and rheological medium properties and his evolution. Then, we analyse the b-value behaviour before to perform an autoregressive analysis on codas of monochromatique events to identify sources of resonance phenomena. Finally, we perform a multiplet analysis by waveform cross-correlation to identify repetitive sources. Global b-value (∼ 1.33) and low Vp/Vs (∼ 1.50) resulting suggest the presence of hydrothermal fluids in a fractured and altered medium which is in good agreement with results of autoregressive analysis. Considering their temporal and spatial evolutions, we are able to estimate a storage depth of fluids mixage and we can infer a temporal overpressure in the system. Following the multiplets analysis results, we highlight a brutal dynamic change after the major local earthquake of Les Saintes (21 November 2004, M=6.3). In summary, we can infer that seismic events occurred at La Soufrière volcano are related to two different source mechanisms: (1) fracturing processes of rocks and (2) resonance of cracks or conduits filled with hydrothermal fluid with a brutal change by a stress modification within the volcano structure.

            "abstract": "Designing effective urban water demand management strategies at the household level does require a deep understanding of the determinants of users’ consumption. Low resolution data on residential water consumption, as traditionally metered, can only be used to model consumers’ behavior at an aggregate level whereas end uses breakdown and the motivations and individual attitudes of consumers are hidden.\nThe recent advent of smart meters allows gathering high frequency consumption data that can be used both to provide instantaneous information to water utilities on the state of the network and continuously inform the users on their consumption and savings.\nSmart metered data also allow for the characterization of water end uses: this information, coupled with users’ psychographic variables, constitutes the knowledge basis for developing individual and multi users models, through which water utilities can test the impact of different management strategies.\nSmartH2O is an EU funded project which aims at creating an ICT platform able to (i) capture and store quasi real time, high resolution residential water usage data measured with smart meters, (ii) infer the main determinants of residential water end uses and build customers’ behavioral models and (iii) predict how the customer behavior can be influenced by various water demand management strategies, spanning from dynamic water pricing schemes to social awareness campaigns. The project exploits a social computing approach for raising users’ awareness about water consumption and pursuing water savings in the residential sector.\nIn this work, we first present the SmartH2O platform and data collection, storage and analysis components. We then introduce some preliminary models and results on total water consumption disaggregation into end uses and single user behaviors using innovative fully automated algorithms and overcoming the need of invasive metering campaigns at the fixture level.",

            "abstract": "The East African Rift System (EARS) represents a key locality for the knowledge of the nature and evolution of SCLM during continental rifting processes, traditionally ascribed to ascending mantle plumes. We report petrological and geothermobarometric data from mantle xenoliths in Quaternary alkali-basalt lava flows and scoria cones at Mega (Sidamo Region; EARS) in the southern Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), that give evidence for refertilization of SCLM and for thinning during Tertiary rifting. Studied samples consist of seven lherzolites, five harzburgites and one olivine-websterite that contain spinel-pyroxene symplectites, interpreted as products of garnet breakdown reactions. These rocks were analyzed for major (whole rock and minerals) and trace elements (pyroxenes). Major element data have been used to reconstruct original garnet composition (pyrope). Equilibration temperatures range from 985 ± 40°C in the garnet facies (2.9-2.2 GPa) to 960 ± 55°C in the spinel facies (1.3 GPa). Xenoliths consist of depleted and fertile peridotites. Five lherzolites have up to 4 wt% of CaO, high CaO/Al2O3 (1.42-4.46), and the most fertile are more enriched than primitive mantle. Variations of major oxides in bulk rocks and minerals are consistent with variable degrees of melt extraction. Evidence for modal and cryptic metasomatism is given by addition of clinopyroxene ± phlogopite, and by LILE and LREE enrichment in clinopyroxene. Refertilization process appears to have been induced by sub-lithospheric volatile-rich melts at high melt/rock ratio, and were followed by cooling. To account for the geodynamic evolution of SCLM beneath the southern MER, which implies a temperature gradient from 50-60 to ∼ 90 mW/m2, we propose that thinning of the base of fertile SCLM from 90-95 to ∼45km depth and associated magmatism occurred along a normal-mantle adiabat above an upwelling asthenosphere (i.e., decompression melting) without the need for significant heat sources.",

            "abstract": "Our study is based on the receiver-function (RF) analysis of a hypothetical regional geological model that extends from oceanic to thick cratonic lithosphere. RF techniques are used to study the interior of Earth. Teleseismic P waves are followed by a series of scattered waves, which occur due to P-to-S converted phases. The sequence of these scattered waves on a time series can be represented by receiver function (RF) for the station and may vary with the incidence angle and azimuth of the incoming P-wave. Here we use iterative deconvolution method to study receiver functions, which provides RF estimates with low noise levels. This method is based on least-squares minimization of the difference between the observed horizontal seismogram and a predicted signal generated by the convolution of an iterative spike train with the vertical-component of seismogram.\nThe study is based on a hypothetical model (800x800x400km) on a mesh with 10 km grid spacing that is smoothly embedded within a standard global Earth model. Physical properties of the regional model match with prescribed surface heat-flow and geoid boundary conditions computed using an approach based on thermodynamics, mineral physics, and solid-Earth geophysics. The model also incorporates seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath the hypothetical continent. A three dimensional model is computed that approximates the mantle flow around the hypothetical continental lithospheric keel. The anisotropy is computed from the flow model and is incorporated to the model. Synthetic seismograms are computed using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, which provides full wave-equation modelling of seismic wave propagation incorporating material properties such as anisotropy, attenuation and fluid-solid interfaces. To ensure a realistic (non-ideal) azimuthal distribution, the event locations are based on a subset of a ten-year global catalog from 2001 to 2010 within the magnitude range from 6.0 to 7.0.",

            "abstract": "Degradation of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is in part, the result of the delivery of fine-grained, terrestrial sediment from catchments draining to the Coral Sea. The Burnett River, draining the GBR experienced severe flooding in 2011 and 2013 with the latter flood breaking all historical records. Huge quantities of sediment were transported to the Coral Sea. The purpose of this study was to quantify the magnitude of sediment eroded from the channel banks during the floods, long term bank-erosion rates, and cost-effective protection measures. System-wide analysis combined with numerical modeling using the Bank-Stability and Toe-Erosion Model (BSTEM) was used to determine annual bank-erosion rates over periods ranging from 4.5 to 100 years.\nAnalysis of 2009 and 2013 aerial imagery revealed that 47.3 Mt (10.4 MT/y) of sediment was eroded from the banks of the lower 300 km of the Burnett River. Erosion of these bank materials does not equate to an equal volume exported to the Coral Sea, as an unknown proportion is deposited. It can be assumed, however, that the majority of the fine-grained materials (54%) were transported out to sea. Long-term simulations (42 years) were conducted using BSTEM, to compare longer term averages with those determined by the catchment model SedNet. Over this longer time period, annual bank-erosion rates were about 3.1 Mt/y, about 18 times greater than the value predicted by SedNet. Assuming 100 years of simulation and using an empirical relation between the length of BSTEM simulations and calculated erosion rates, a conservative value for the annual rate of bank erosion is 2.0 Mt/y. The BSTEM results and analysis of aerial imagery are within 10%. Bank erosion, instead of being a minor source of sediment representing 8% of the total, was found to be the single largest contributor, representing between 44 and 73% of the total annual sediment budget. In absolute terms, this is an increase in the reported average, annual rate of bank erosion from 0.175 Mt/y to 2.0 Mt/y. The significance of bank erosion to total, fine-grained sediment loads are drastically different than those reported for the Burnett and other Reef Catchments where fields and uplands are listed as the leading sediment contributors. These results pose important implications for sediment management and protection of the GBR.",

            "abstract": "Direct push technologies have recently seen a broad development providing several tools for in situ parameterization of unconsolidated sediments. One of these techniques is the measurement of soil colors – a proxy information that reveals to soil/sediment properties. We introduce the direct push driven color logging tool (CLT) for real-time and depth-resolved investigation of soil colors within the visible spectrum. Until now, no routines exist on how to handle high-resolved (mm-scale) soil color data. To develop such a routine, we transform raw data (CIEXYZ) into soil color surrogates of selected color spaces (CIExyY, CIEL*a*b*, CIEL*c*h*, sRGB) and denoise small-scale natural variability by Haar and Daublet4 wavelet transformation, gathering interpretable color logs over depth. However, interpreting color log data as a single application remains challenging. Additional information, such as site-specific knowledge of the geological setting, is required to correlate soil color data to specific layers properties. Hence, we exemplary provide results from a joint interpretation of in situ-obtained soil color data and ‘state-of-the-art’ direct push based profiling tool data and discuss the benefit of additional data. The developed routine is capable of transferring the provided information obtained as colorimetric data into interpretable color surrogates. Soil color data proved to correlate with small-scale lithological/chemical changes (e.g., grain size, oxidative and reductive conditions), especially when combined with additional direct push vertical high resolution data (e.g., cone penetration testing and soil sampling). Thus, the technique allows enhanced profiling by means of providing another reproducible high-resolution parameter for analysis subsurface conditions. This opens potential new areas of application and new outputs for such data in site investigation. It is our intention to improve color measurements by means method of application and data interpretation, useful to characterize vadose layer/soil/sediment characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The Mekong Delta in Vietnam is expected to face challenges from various forms of climate-induced events. In addition, a growing population, which currently stands at 18.6 million people lives in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Therefore, the Mekong Delta is the focus of international action for adaptation. However, many climate sensitive regions and communities are unprepared for climate-induced natural disasters due to mismatch in perception with their respective risks.\nThis study examines the vulnerability and appropriate adaptation in the Mekong Delta from both scientific and regional aspects. First, we show the change in coastal areas in Soc Trang province, comparing the past to the present images using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and satellite. We identify some vulnerable areas which derived from multiple factors due to coastal erosion, flooding, and sea level rise. Second, we present results of perception survey about climate change and the adaptation at community level in Ca Mau, Soc Trang, and An Giang Provinces, which were conducted in 2012 and 2014. While the findings suggest varying degrees of adaptation to seasonal flooding by raising the ground floors of their homes and repairing houses, their capacity to prepare for extreme flooding is limited in spite of the residents’ awareness of the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Third, we propose an erosion-resistant dyke reinforcement technique by mixing natural palm tree fiber and cement, both of which are locally available materials in the Mekong Delta. It is expected that adaptation with multiple protections in accordance to regional feature can work well for such coastal disasters.",

            "abstract": "The Miocene Torres del Paine intrusive complex (TPIC) in Patagonia is a spectacularly exposed example of a bimodal shallow crustal laccolith, made up of a sill complex and a subvertical feeder system. The TPIC was emplaced in a back-arc setting, but slightly older arc-related intrusive units in this area testify to an earlier shift from an arc to a backarc setting. The entire ~88 km3 main complex was emplaced over short time scales of 162 ± 11 ka between ~12.4 and 12.6 Ma, with mafic units from the feeder zone found to be older than mafic units from the sill complex1,2. We aim to assess whether successive pulses of mafic magmatism can tap different geochemical reservoirs in sheeted magmatic complexes emplaced on such short timescales.\nHf isotope compositions of individual zircons from mafic units from both the feeder zone and the sill complex were determined by solution MC-ICPMS. Zircons from all units have Hf isotope compositions that indicate a slightly enriched mantle source. Zircons from the mafic sill complex units have higher (more juvenile) initial εHf than zircons from feeder zone mafic units. The shift towards more depleted Hf isotope compositions in the sill complex units, which are younger, demonstrates the rapid input of new juvenile material into the source region between ~12.6 Ma and ~12.5 Ma. A similar shift is also seen in bulk rock Nd and Sr isotope data for related samples3.\nThe Hf isotope data demonstrate that significant variability in source geochemistry is possible for sheeted magmatic complexes built up on very short timescales. Analysis of zircons from a range of dikes and intrusive bodies external to the main Torres del Paine complex, with ages that span ~12–29 Ma, will provide a more complete picture in time and space of the geochemical evolution of this magmatic system as it switches between an arc and backarc setting.\n1Leuthold et al., 2012, EPSL, 325: 85–92\n2Michel et al., 2008, Geology, 36: 459–462\n3Leuthold et al., 2013, JPET, 54: 273–303",

            "abstract": "The imaging spectrometer VIRTIS onboard Rosetta (Coradini et al., 2007) acquires spectra in the range from the near-UV through the IR (0.25-5 micron). Infrared spectra are affected by thermal emission from the surface of the comet, so the measured radiance in that spectral region can be used to retrieve surface temperatures and spectral emissivities by means of temperature-retrieval algorithms (Tosi et al., 2014, Erard, 2014). The temperature of a surface, and in particular its variation with respect to illumination conditions, depends strongly on the thermal inertia of the materials composing this surface and the sub-surface, but also on the topography and small scale roughness. Theoretical codes computing surface and subsurface temperatures under a range of different assumptions on the composition, activity and physical status of the surface matter are used to reproduce the IR radiances observed, and the apparent/effective thermal inertia determined in this way is assumed to correspond to reality (Capria et al., 2014). The initial results obtained using the data acquired during the approach and pre-landing (July 2014-November 2014) first phases of the Rosetta mission will be presented.\nAuthors acknowledge the funding from Italian, German and French Space Agencies.\n",

(2014), especially focusing on the restriction of the time step in the OS-coordinate. We first propose two new methods to solve the basis vectors of the OS-coordinate, both of which avoid the spatial rotation proposed by Li et al. (2014), therefore simplifying the solving procedure of the OS-coordinate. Moreover, for the major drawback of the OS-coordinate, which is the convergence and the divergence of the grid-lines pointed out by Li et al. (2014), we revise their basis vectors and design a new general rotation parameter to create the new basis vectors of the OS-coordinate. The experimental results show that using these new basis vectors, we can improve the orthogonality of the 3-D coordinate surfaces of the OS-coordinate. More importantly, we can easily control the distance between the neighbour grid-lines, therefore alleviating the restriction of the time step in the OS-coordinate. These have been validated by the idealized Schär-type advection experiments.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the rheology and mineral reactions in a brittle-ductile shear zone within the Wyangala Batholith, SE Australia. In the shear zone, a coarse-grained two feldspar-quartz-biotite granite is transformed into a fine-grained quartz-muscovite mylonite.\nThe samples from shear zone margins display cataclasis of feldspar and crystal-plastic deformation of quartz. Quartz accommodates most of the deformation and is extensively recrystallized showing distinct crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO). Feldspar-to-muscovite, biotite-to-muscovite and albitization reactions occur locally at fracture and porphyroclast margins. However, the bulk rock composition shows very little change in respect to the wall rock composition.\nIn the shear zone centre, quartz occurs as large, weakly deformed porphyroclasts, in sizes similar to that in the wall rock, suggesting that it has undergone little deformation. Feldspars and biotite are almost completely reacted to muscovite, which is arranged in a fine grained interconnected network. Muscovite has accommodated most of the strain. Muscovite rich layers contain significant amounts of fine grained intermixed quartz with random CPO. XRF bulk rock analysis suggests a significant increase in SiO2 and depletion in NaO content compared with the wall rock composition.\nWe suggest that the high and low strain fabrics represent markedly different scenarios and cannot be interpreted as a simple sequential development with respect to strain. The large quartz clasts in the central parts of the shear zone have never undergone the structural development displayed by the low strain domain. We interpret that the fabrics in the shear zone centre have formed due to fluid influx probably along an initially brittle fracture where hydration reactions dramatically changed the rheological property of the rock. Subsequent ductile deformation focussed in the newly produced muscovite-quartz layers, thus original quartz grains did not recrystallize. In contrast, in the shear zone margins the amount of fluid and reactions was limited therefore deformation was taken up mainly by the relatively weak original igneous quartz.\nThe studied shear zone exemplifies the role of fluids and fluid-induced reactions on contrasting rheological behaviour at local scales.",

The balance between fossil carbon supply, and the sufficiency (size) and capability (technology, security) of candidate carbon stores is assessed. The timescale of carbon retention by the variety of proposed stores has potentially important consequences for future climates.

However, the occurrences of fault rock types and fluid-rock interaction patterns along major thrust zone differ significantly, instead of similar background temperatures (~250°C). In this presentation we compare two representative fault zones showing contrasting mineralogy and water-rock interaction patterns.\nUltrafine-grained black fault rocks (BFRs) comprise the principal slip zone of the Pasagshak Point Thrust of the Kodiak accretionary complex. The geochemistry of the BFRs is characterized by Li and Sr enrichment, Rb and Cs depletion, and a low 87Sr/86Sr ratio. These geochemical signatures are explained by fluid-rock interactions at >350°C, which result in preferential removal of Rb and Cs and formation of plagioclase under the presence of fluids with high Li and Sr concentrations and low 87Sr/86Sr ratios.\nIn contrast to the Pasagshak Point Thrust, the fault core of the Nobeoka Thrust in the Shimanto accretionary complex is mineralogically characterized by breakdown of plagioclase and enrichment in clay and carbonate minerals. Values of illite crystallinity expressed as a full width at half maximum of the illite (001) peak in clay-fraction XRD increase within fault zones, showing the absence of significant temperature rise.\nTemperatures of fault plane during fluid-rock interaction may affect the difference in mineralogical characters of the two fault zones. Further mineralogical and geochemical investigations are necessary to explore the nature of fluids and its role in faulting along seismogenic subduction plate boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Over the last years several 2D thermo-mechanical models of the Costa Rica - Nicaragua Subduction Zone (CNSZ) have studied the thermal distribution of sections of the fault. Such investigations allow us to understand temperature-related aspects of subduction zones, like volcanism and megathrust earthquake locations. However, certain features of the CNSZ limit the range of applicability of 2D models. In the CNSZ, geochemical trends and seismic anisotropy studies reveal a 3D mantle wedge flow that departs from the 2D corner flow. The origin of this flow are dip variations (20o to 25o between Nicaragua and Costa Rica) and the presence of a slab window in Panama that allows material to flow into the mantle wedge. Also, the Central America trench has abrupt variations in surface heat flux that contrasts with steady changes in plate age and convergence rate. These variations have been attributed to hydrothermal circulation (HC), which effectively removes heat from the oceanic crust.\nIn this project we analyze the thermal structure of the CNSZ. The objective is to study dehydration and metamorphic reactions, as well as the length of the megathrust seismogenic zone. We created 3D finite-element models that employ a dislocation creep rheology for the mantle wedge. Two aspects make our models different from previous studies: an up-to-date 3D slab geometry, and an implementation of HC by introducing a conductive proxy in the subducting aquifer, allowing us to model convective heat transport without the complex, high-Rayleigh number calculations. A 3D oceanic boundary condition that resembles the along-strike changes in surface heat flux is also employed. Results show a maximum mantle wedge flow rate of 4.69 cm/yr in the along-strike direction, representing more than 50% of the slab convergence rate. With respect to 2D models, analysis shows this flow changes temperatures by ~100 C in the mantle wedge near areas of strong slab curvature. Along the subducting interface, there is also a change of 10-40 C, which can have a significant impact on dehydration and metamorphic reactions. Also, 2D models have proven that HC controls temperatures along the subduction thrust, which controls the length of the seismogenic zone. In general, the combined effect of 3D mantle wedge flow and HC is expected to have a significant impact on the thermal structure.",

In this model two rupture fronts separated by 40 seconds emanate close to the hypocenter and propagate towards the trench. This feature is clearly observed by stacking the slip-rate snapshots on fault points aligned in the EW direction passing through the hypocenter (Gabriel et al, 2012), suggesting slip reactivation during the main event. A repeating slip on large earthquakes may occur due to frictional melting and thermal fluid pressurization effects. Kanamori & Heaton (2002) argued that during faulting of large earthquakes the temperature rises high enough creating melting and further reduction of friction coefficient.\nWe created a 3D dynamic rupture model to reproduce this slip reactivation pattern using SPECFEM3D (Galvez et al, 2014) based on a slip-weakening friction with sudden two sequential stress drops . Our model starts like a M7-8 earthquake breaking dimly the trench, then after 40 seconds a second rupture emerges close to the trench producing additional slip capable to fully break the trench and transforming the earthquake into a megathrust event. The resulting sea floor displacements are in agreement with 1Hz GPS displacements (GEONET).\nThe seismograms agree roughly with seismic records along the coast of Japan.The simulated sea floor displacement reaches 8-10 meters of up-lift close to the trench, which may be the cause of such a devastating tsunami followed by the Tohoku earthquake. To investigate the impact of such a huge up-lift, we ran tsunami simulations with the slip reactivation model using sam(oa)2 (O. Meister et al., 2012), a state-of-the-art Finite-Volume framework to simulate the resulting tsunami waves.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 M9 Tohoku earthquake ruptured a fault area with length and width of ~500 km and ~200 km, respectively, and elastically deformed broad lithospheric and mantle regions. In order to evaluate the influence of the Tohoku earthquake on lithospheric stresses throughout Japan, an accurate accounting of coseismic slip is very important as the initial condition. We investigate the effects of heterogeneous elastic moduli under Japan on the inversion for coseismic slip, utilizing the land-based Japan GPS network as well as seafloor geodetic constraints near the trench. For this purpose, we construct a 3-D finite element model (FEM) to generate Green’s functions that allows considering the influence of complex slab geometry as well as heterogeneities in elastic structure. Our FEM incorporates the Pacific and Philippine sea slabs by interpolating seismicity for the Tohoku region and the Nankai trough, as well as the Kuril, Ryukyu and Izu-Bonin arcs. As fault source geometry, we consider not only the Pacific but also the Phillipine sea slab, with initial results suggesting that slip occurring beyond the triple junction is ~1 m. As for elastic heterogeneity, we investigated the effect of the crust-mantle stratification, the contrast of oceanic and continental crust, and the effects of slabs. Results indicate that crust-mantle stratification has to be considered to obtain an appropriate coseismic slip distribution; heterogeneous models show smaller maximum slip and a wider distribution compared to homogeneous structure. This confirms some earlier work, but is in contrast to some recent suggestions. The effect of the ocean-continent contrast and deep slab heterogeneity appear negligible for co-seismic inversions.",
